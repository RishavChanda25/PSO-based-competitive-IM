#NAME?,,"Family and I came here last night and waited for around 40 minutes for a table of four. When we finally got it, we were placed at a really cramped table with chairs poking the nearby table's occupants. That aside, I can see why this place is an institution!   The cheesy, chargrilled oysters were delicious and worth the wait.

Can't say the same for the soft-shell crab platter as the crab was coated in an extremely salty batter. Nor the Oyster Rockefeller soup which nearly gave me hypertension with the amount of sodium in there. Noticed that the salty batter was used in other dishes as well. 

Our waitress was brisk but her presence was fleeting and it took me a good 10 minutes to spot her for add-ons. She was attentive in refilling our water though.

Come here for the oysters and sweet potato fries if you can stand the wait but skip the fried dishes, lest you truly love salt.",
#NAME?,I had to try the Nashville Hot Chicken from the source while visiting. It is everything I could have expected and more. The chicken was fresh and juicy and the Mac-n-cheese was surprisingly delicious. I highly recommend if you are willing to wait a half hour in line!,,
#NAME?,,,Came here while on vacation. Highly disappointed.  The fish was bland; no seasoning at all and the red beans and rice taste like Popeye's.
#NAME?,"I used to always say my favorite food was sushi. Now I say its hot chicken!!!! Going there for dinner tonight!

Food is quick, always hot when it comes out, and tastes AMAZING. And I don't get sick after eating it like I do some other hot chicken places.",,
-03y31IzykunU9azzgLsoQ,"Nashville loves their hot chicken and this place was a hit with my taste buds.

We were a large group and managed to find seating on a Friday night with an extensive line - I mean this is mostly a take-out spot or grab n' go, so even with limited seats, you should be able to manage.

I believe we waited about an hour in line and the line moved at a good pace and was definitely around the block.  

I ordered the medium chicken sandwich, and I love spicy food!  I just did not want to get an upset stomach at my own bach party (was not feeling the pain).  And believe me, my sandwich was SPICY and I can handle spicy food.  It was the right level of spice for me, any more and I would need to drink copious amounts of water.

I recommend checking this place out if you're in Nashville.",,
-0V5DVnId4nZn5pkiaILzw,,"I know a place that tastes better that didn't have an long wait. This place is crowded for a Sunday night.

Fried shrimp and alligator was good. 
 
Gumbo was very mediocre.",
-0aZWYi2YicFaLxTru96nA,,"This place always has a long line outside the door, no matter what time of the day it is. A group of 7 of us stopped by around 8pm on a Saturday night for dinner and waited about 40 minutes. When we were finally seated, things started going downhill. Our server was sloppy and forgetful, bringing out 2-3 glasses of water at a time, disappearing and forgetting to bring the rest of the water, and then forgetting to bring straws. We ordered 2 dozen chargrilled oysters for the table as appetizers, and our food came out before the appetizers because he forgot to put in the order and it takes 20 minutes to make. Then out came 1 dozen and we were still really waiting for 1.5 dozen, since someone ordered a half dozen for their meal. I ordered the fried 1/2 shrimp 1/2 fish platter, which was forgettable - I didn't even bother eating the fries and the hush puppies were dry. 

Per Yelp recommendations, we also ordered Boo fries since every review raved about them..... it was nothing special, so I would not order them. 

SUMMARY: The food is NOT worth the wait and NOT worth the hype. They also included gratuity in the bill for us since we were 6+ people, which must be why our server was terrible at his job since there is no incentive to get anything right.",
-0b84SUGVN0YkG5j2MCmBw,"As described....great fried. chicken in several heat levels. You choose what you want, pay, get your drink and find a seat. They bring your food in about 10 minutes or so. I choose the hot heat level along with Mac n cheese and the black-eyed pea salad. Everything was good. You won't be disappointed.",,
-0dlcohtjV4imAU4Vybddg,,"Fresh raw oysters and boiled crawfish - simply delicious! The queue may be long sometimes but it goes pretty quickly, it's worth the wait. Will definitely come back again when in town, IMO the best fresh oyster house in town!",
-1_1ndYu401hZkquoqK-4w,,"AMAZING! One of the best meals I've ever had. The chargrilled oysters, crawfish ettoufe and soft shell crab plate were to die for. Definitely coming back again whenever I'm in NOLA. Worth the wait!",
-1rQBZ4Z6fxjklzahyLISw,,"It is always a must to eat here, every time I come to NOLA. I crave their chargrilled oysters. Staff is friendly and food is always amazing.  If you love oysters, it never disappoints.",
#NAME?,,"When we got there, looks like a hole in the wall. Didn't have big expectations, but, I was definitely wrong. The service was awesome and the food..... the food was so good I want to have it for every meal while here. If you're in anew Orleans. Definitely gotta check this out.",
-22PBmQh7bBWbNX1irrkPQ,,"MUST GET: chargrilled oysters

Although I've never had chargrilled oysters, I thought these were amazingggg. I went to Neyow's for chargrilled oysters as well and thought those were good too but I think I liked Acme more. 

Service / servers were nice and friendly. 

Things I didn't love as much:
- Waited 45 minutes to an hour for party of 8. Not a terrible wait but you stand in a cafeteria type like (as opposed to putting your name down)
- jambalaya and gumbo were good but not great

If I come back, it's definitely for the oysters.",
-24qzhOmqf_Aze0tICNd8A,,,"Food was amazing! Definitely a ""go to"" for yummy food and a great vibe! Thanks to our waiter, John!"
-32WtapJvTQrG59p6hgVyg,,"Two words: Gumbo. Poopa.  No, it's not something that happens after a big night of gumbo and beer... it's gumbo in a bread bowl.  Ok, admittedly I've become far too excited about things in bread bowls since coming to the US (mmm, New England Clam chowder...) but who doesn't want to be able to eat the crockery??

Acme is one of those places that is just popular cos it is popular.  The food is great but not spectacular, prices are ok and the drinks list is average but as a package it's got that certain something about it.  It is POPULAR, so expect to have to join the long line outside waiting for a table.  However, you can go inside and order drinks at the bar then wobble back outside to the one person you left in line. Being NOLA, drinking in the street is not only allowed, it's a requirement.

Definitely worth a visit or two!",
-3HYmxW_5Gsg4I0eH3ju-Q,"Hey .. going here from day 1 and just like other top restaurants this place is perfect food wise., service wise and ambiance wise. 

They are doing a hell of a job and their chicken no matter hot , medium or southern is cooked just right. One thing left to try here is the sunday brunch , besides that tried it and place is a rockstar.

I usually order to go in the evenings as there is always a line and the wait can get to 30 minutes. So pick it up go home and get your fingers dirty.",,
-3WDAOZFrQkXh7kB_PcVgw,,"eeeeh...   not the worst place I've eaten, but come NOLA, you can do better...  Or maybe I just made a bad choice.  

The wait outside the door is not bad at all....  Actually, it moves very fast.  Thought, it's misleading because typically good food will come with a long wait.  Fail....

The service was excellent.  Very attentive, friendly, and made sure we were well taken care of.  Though, I never weigh any review on service.  Actually, bad service can still get a 4 star review if the food is good.  

We had the gumbo, jambalaya, broiled oysters, oyster shooters, raw oysters and finished it with a banana foster...

Raw Oyster- can't screw that up
Broiled Oysters - Not impressed, all the grease without the flavor
jambalaya- I've had it in a buffet
Gumbo- blah, bland, and had the little salad size cocktail shrimp...

Eat somewhere else, unless you want raw oysters....  or eat there just to say you did.  I'll give it one more chance only because it gets such good reviews...",
-3laRXxBuubKbyzSFMswrA,,"I came here with high expectations and I thought this was way overrated. There was a long line outside of the restaurant at 6 and they told us to stand outside which was fine. For some odd reason, after waiting 5 minutes they led us to our seats so we were pleasantly surprised. The second you walk in, you are overwhelmed w/ the smell of seafood. We ordered a dozen raw and charboiled oysters and they were good. I ordered half oyster/half shrimp po boy which was delicious. The service was ok. We asked for napkins and drinks several times and the waitress  took her time getting it. If I had to choose between Deanie's and Acme, I would DEFINITELY pick Deanie's.",
-3lpj5r-XWYzsk-ulYQkcA,"A Nashville staple and a must-visit when you're here! It's about the experience as much as it is about the food!!!

Everyone kept telling us to come here, and to come here early! When we arrived, it became apparent as to why! We showed up at 10:30am even though they opened at 11am and there was already a long line. We ended up waiting almost an hour and by the time we made it inside, there were no tables left. So we had to make new friends and join another table (thank God for southern hospitality!)

The servings are big! My friends and I all got ""small plates"" of chicken. We tried the medium and hot. The seasoning/breading is where all the heat is - and do not be fooled... the heat is latent and hits you a little after your first bite. I love hot and spicy food, but I was happier with my medium after tasting my hot. I loved the fries and the greens (collards). We also sampled the potato salad, cole slaw, and beans, while enjoying a cold local beer to wash it down. It was all pretty solid and a great experience!",,
-3r0CX7niGCyUnqkKZcmSQ,,"Our first culinary conquest during a bachelor party set an uneasy precedence about restaurants in New Orleans: great food, meh service. But Acme Oyster House's service was by far the worst. It was almost as bad as their food was good!

The charbroiled oysters are going to haunt me until I am able to slam down another half dozen the next time I visit. And the Peacemaker Po'Boy brought a sense of true, pure inner peace only deep fried bivalves could possibly muster.

But then there was the service. SLOOOOOW. And not even the type of slow that occurs to ""inspire"" a table to order another round of beers. Just standard uncaring slowness. When our waitress brought over the wrong dish and I informed her that I ordered the peacemaker she responded with ""no, you didn't."" She produced her scratch pad with indecipherable handwriting trying to convince me, and my table mates who heard my order, that I had not ordered that entree. She brusquely retreated to resubmit my proper order and was shorty called over by our neighboring table to tell her that they did not receive their proper entree either.",
-41S-0Fhh40dYKRyqCzyVQ,"Seriously hot chicken, but not just heat - flavor too.  One of the best spots to get straight up Nashville hot chicken.",,
-42J4Ua39jd8qdf0nnw70w,,We went across the street to Felix's and they had the same oysters. Both of which gave me the ass of a loose faucet.,
-4JpQKfrzO85uxZDPE4vJw,,,"If you're looking for traditional New Orleans food, this is your place! It's a great atmosphere located in the heart of the French quarter. Food is awesome especially the crab cake appetizer and their signature redfish oceana. The staff was awesome and super friendly! I will def be back!"
-4QjN6My0meqBjloBlnVOA,,This place serves the most delishish chargrilled oysters I have ever had. We had to wait in line to get in but it was worth every minute of the wait. If you are looking to experience and taste the best oysters DO NOT PASS this place up.,
-4RIHaYziMq84EfR5Df8Jw,,,"Just finished a late light dinner at Oceana. Absolutely satisfied with everything. There was a line, we almost walked away, but chatted with others in line who said it was worth the wait. Line moved very fast, less than 10 minutes. Our server Shahan was professional, prompt, offered insight on what his thoughts on menu, what are the favs. 

We had blackened gator bites and crab cakes (wife had GF), everything was hot, flavorful and seasoned superbly. Washed it down with sweet tea. A+ on this visit, prices are reasonable and nice atmosphere even with kids. We will be coming back for another dinner (or breakfast) before departing the big easy!"
-4_ZG4jv3If2RnNFn293yw,,"Acne Oyster House was delicious. I feel the real winner on the menu is obviously the oysters. The charbroiled oysters were the real standout. We only ordered a dozen to start (since none of us really like oysters) we ended up eating three dozen in total. I will never look at oysters the same. So delicious! The appetizers are pretty good and really reasonably priced. The entrees were good, but not spectacular. The bread pudding with vanilla ice cream was the other item that we could have had ten helpings of. Overall it was a great dining experience and we would highly recommend.",
-594af_E7Z9VVjQc9pJK3g,,"In NOLA for a few days, and we were eager to get some grub!

We tried a bit of everything and thought everything was really good! A pound of crawfish were hot, cooked and seasoned well; raw oysters were huge and fresh; broiled oysters were cooked right and tasted good; red beans, seafood gumbo and jambalaya with a side of soft shell crab were all flavorful!

We invited friends to check it out and they thought ACME was pretty awesome as well. 

Highly suggest you go when they open so you don't have to get in line.",
-5Bo_dnqZTsqf8ZRhsqakA,,,"Ordered the Jambalaya - it was great.  Very good food, atmosphere and service.  I highly recommend it."
-5O9TjkStilD3MU0fdaP2w,"The place runs like a well oiled machine! Don't let the long lines scare you off, it goes pretty quickly. The chicken was really good but so were our side dishes! All the employees were friendly and on point when you would expect them to be annoyed at the huge crowds of people, they made us feel welcomed.",,
-5Oo7-AzHc-tzdNLWIFccQ,"I hadn't heard of Hot Chicken until one of my husbands coworkers mentioned the best Hot chicken place was  in Nashville. We ended up traveling thru Nashville do we decided to try it out. The first location was WAY to crowded. There were 20 plus people standing outside in line. My husband opted to try a second location and it did not disappoint. There was one family in front of us in line which was perfect. The restaurant was buzzing though, it wasn't dead. The  chicken was absolutely amazing. It was crispy on the outside and so juicy inside. My only issue which is a catch 22 it was so hot I couldn't hold the chicken well, like I said a catch 22 because of course I wanted it to be hot. My whole family loved it. I only hope is that we get back to Nashville to have it again.",,
-5QISIFy-jbh8DyS8CTHOg,"Hattie B's!!!!!! I just had to try the fried chicken when we were in Nashville so e waited in line 90 minutes on a hot day and boy was it worth the wait! So much food, you will not leave hungry!",,
-5ye1ya0wRQhNRF9NfQ1fA,,"We came here 10-15-16 mainly for their oysters. The line appeared to be long, however, it moved pretty quick. Sitting at the bar is a good option if there are only 2 people, otherwise I would choose a table. The oysters were big and good flavor. The fried craw puppies and jambalaya were both good sides 4/5.  We attempted to order their hot wings (not on the menu) but they just stopped serving them.
Overall, it's a perfect stop when you're in New Orleans.",
-60C6LUgqKVcaOsvDQeXyA,,"Acme Oyster is one of the rare touristy things that is totally worth it. The chargrilled oysters at Acme have changed my life. I don't think I will enjoy eating anything ever again as much as I enjoyed wolfing down a dozen chargrilled. 

Go with a small party and ask to sit at the bar. My husband and I were pulled from the end of a long line of large groups waiting for a table. It was fun to sit at the bar and watch the guys shuck oysters.",
-6CEeB-DNVlgbK659r0rjA,,,"Stopped here for dinner on my first night in NOLA, and there was a line. When i saw the line i knew this place had to be good. And even though there was a line, the wait was less than 20 min. On the outside it looked small, but in reality its very spacious on the inside. 

For the appetizer we got oysters on the half shell which were very fresh tasting and gator bites which were perfectly seasoned. For the entree i was able to enjoy the Red Fish Oceana. Such a hearty serving with a great crawfish sauce that they put on the top of the fish. My dad got the Taste of NOLA which gave you a sample of everything that NOLA is known for. Both dishes were full of flavor and came out piping hot! For dessert i enjoyed the creme brulee which had the perfect sweetness.

I definitely recommend this as a place to stop if you are visiting NOLA. Service was quick and awesome."
-6Mvirp6cAHgviRZhdmfjw,,,"Need a place that opens early for breakfast in the French Quarters? Look no further. Oceana opens at 8 am and is located right off of Bourbon St. We were seated immediately and given the breakfast menu and the breakfast special menu. I chose to order the Crab Cake Benedict and my friend ordered the Crawfish Omelette Wendall which came with hash browns and a biscuit; both on the specials menu. 

The poached egg on the crab cake benedict was perfect. Once you cut through it, the egg yolk oozes out. The English muffin was also nicely toasted. The crab cake portion was tasty but got a bit too salty as I progressed through it. 

My friend's crawfish omelette wendall was a pretty large omelette. She said there was a lot of crawfish though there were two that looked a little old. The egg was pretty fluffy. 

Service was excellent but I was a little thrown off that our waiter stood a few feet from us the whole time watching us. It was a little unsettling. The bathroom was clean but there aren't toilet seat covers, ladies! Also, Yelpers who check-in currently get 10% off their total bill!"
-6U8UW-DR7mL2HexFfNbfA,,,"Based on good reviews, my husband and I wanted to try Oceana Grill while in New Orleans.  We were able to do breakfast there before starting our day.  It was like a 5 minute walk from our hotel which was really convenient.  We started off with some great bloody Mary's!  Full of flavor and just the right amount of spice!  Loved it!  The food was just as amazing.  I had a special Crab Cake Benedict they had that day with some hash browns.  The crab cakes had so much flavor to them!  My husband had the Royal Omelet (because of the alligator sausage) with grits and a side of creamy pork sausage gravy.  By the look on his face after the first bite I could tell he was in food heaven!  The alligator sausage was juicy and full of flavor!  He even loved the grits with the gravy!  Though we were comfortably full after our meal .... we both had bloody Mary's to go!   That was one the best tasting meals we had while we were in New Orleans!  The service was quick and awesome as well!  Definitely would return if we're ever in NO again!"
-6bsEIMFz6ndaWXaakISSw,"What a great option for quality Nashville hot chicken to go, or to eat there if you decide to. My favorite is the hot chicken sandwich, with juicy chicken perfectly battered with the right amount of spice. You also won't ever go wrong with their pimento Mac and cheese and a side, YUM",,
-6wHx3CYNTVQY8xW9vRraA,"Chicken is good, service is fast. But honesty probably wouldn't come again. NONE of the sides wowed me. The beans were the best (and we tried them all). Banana pudding is a NO. Peach cobbler was a better option. Very very little seating, and to be honest kind of uncomfortable with how cramped it is. Line was long but moved quickly. Chicken is juicy and flavorful but for me I can settle on making this a one and done. I did like the comeback dipping sauce. I got the medium tenders and it's like a warmer buffalo.",,
-6zIYjYga4lQ6MkT57i3nw,,"I must stop here every time I visit NOLA. I'm usually impatient, but I don't mind the lines and I don't mind the tourists. Their chargrilled oysters full of garlicky, cheesy, buttery goodness washed down with an Abita could me by final meal and I would die happy.",
-78RRWJBrFlldvllagVVEw,First Nashville hot chicken experience and it was good. Went with the damn hot chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese. So good. Not overly breaded but good crunch. The comeback sauce is great on it.  The line moves pretty quickly and food comes out super fast.,,
-7VEhf6dK9HIguOFyBWAPQ,,legit oysters.  Some of the best bbq oysters I've ever had.  The bbq oysters are so good I'm thinking about getting a cast iron oyster pan to try and replicate the yumminess.  Super casual place.  Perfect kid place or large group place.,
-7a_ViPlUJ7wsJVdHwXruw,,,"Talk about customer service! Their staff is so friendly and kind. There was a mistake with our order, so my table received a free tray of half a dozen oysters on the rocks. The food was just fine. A lot of fried food on the menu. I had the blackened chicken po boy. It was flavorful and a large portion for the $15 price tag. I would come back here again for the staff and customer service, but can't say that the food was the star of the experience. We went right around 5:30 and got a table right away. By the time we had finished there was a line waiting around the block! A popular place."
#NAME?,Now let me explain. I thought i had lived life before this. Tried plenty of delicious food. Always expanded my array of dishes and flavors. However this chicken changed all of that. I died and went to heaven in this establishment. The hot chicken was so tender and flavorful it lit up my whole life and reignited the passion I felt for food. I got the medium chicken. I'm a person who loves hot sauce and this was the perfect amount of heat and flavor paired together. The fries were unreal out of this world delicious. This is the kind of food that tasted good warmed up the next day. That's when you know this stuff is good. I wish I could eat here every day of my life.,,
-8HoPzdMhM1p3Px8tSxnZQ,,"The only way to get the most out of New Orleans and the French Quarter is to ask someone who has been here for recommendations to the best of the best places to eat, especially when it comes to Oysters and Gumbo, the NOLA famous dishes   Thanks to my good friend Gina P. out of Yelp Fort Lauderdale, I hit a home run on BOTH and then some at Acme Oyster House.  

It is a known fact the Acme can have an extensive waiting line, but I was not going to miss the chance to try it here because word has it that if you want the best Oysters; Raw, Charbroiled or even Oyster Shooters, Acme is IT in the French Quarter.

 Actuality, the line went pretty fast considering the amount of people in front of us.  We met a real nice couple in line with us and decided that if it was faster to get a table of 4, we liked each other enough to sit together and continue to get to know each other.  The hostess and staff that checked on us outside were incredibly friendly and accommodating, so that is what we did. 

The atmosphere is upbeat and gave me that great French Quarter feeling that we were among a lot of happy diners and our server who came over made it even better.  We ordered drinks and it being our first day in the French Quarter I had to have an American Mule to start out my journey.  

I have heard about their Charbroiled Oysters, pretty popular and also wanted to compare ""Oysters to Oysters"" and order a dozen Raw Oysters, so being that my wife does not like them raw, she ordered the Charbroiled and I ordered the Raw to get a chance to share the Charbroiled.  WOW, first time ever having any charbroiled Oysters, but that herb butter the oysters were sitting on, and the bread to dip was magnificent. the flavor of the herb butter alone made this dish a hit.  I could not imagine getting better anywhere else, and I was right, because within the couple days of ordering other types of Charbroiled Oysters, most were served with a heavy garlic and sometimes salty breading, which drowned out the true taste of the oysters. NOT HERE. Simple and delicious. 

The Raw Oysters were the freshest, juicy and tasty oysters I have ever had.  Nice size, served with cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon, I slowly savored what I thought were definitely the best I have ever had, anywhere. 

As long as we were at Acme Oyster House , which is known to be one of the best restaurants for popular NOLA cuisine, we decided to try other favorites. On the menu was a Half Po Boy and Cup of Soup/Gumbo option and for a great price. There are several choices of Po Boys on the menu such as Ham, Turkey, Roast Beef, Shrimp, Fried Fish, and Grilled Smoked or Hot Sausage.  I opted for the NOLA favorite, the Shrimp Po Boy; a nice healthy portion of fried shrimp served on a fresh roll with lettuce, tomato and pickles.  May I stress, they really were generous with the shrimp.  The Seafood Gumbo was thick with shrimp and crab topped off with white rice.  The Gumbo, after trying others on this trip had the best thickness and generous portions of the shrimp and crab. 

I loved our waitress because she did not make this seem like work for her.  She knew why we were there and had a good time with us.  The place is busy, but never lacked service.  They had that down here.  

I loved this place so much, I had to buy an Acme Oyster House tee shirt for only $20.00.  Speaking of prices, I could not believe how reasonable our bill was considering the quality of food, service and popularity.

DO NOT LET THE LONG LINES FOOL YOU, it is SO  worth it, and it moves a lot quicker than you might think.  I can't wait to WAIT again for this place to get the BEST OF THE BEST NOLA dishes.",
-8hZRpcLXO-arrHDLmkuDA,"This place is AMAZING!!!! Waited in line for about an hour (which was expected, so be sure to plan ahead!) and was not disappointed!! By far the best friend chicken I've ever eaten. I suggest the mac & cheese, it was to die for!! Well worth the wait!",,
-8p9gFWBxU8ZseMJAm86oQ,,,We had just landed and were starving! Most places were closed but Oceana Grill was open and pleased to sit us. We had a great experience and the food was amazing! I had the Shrimp Platter and it was great! Plus a ton of food (very generous portions) This was my second time returning to this restaurant and I will be returning on my next trip to NOLA.
-9OEoNjcLa9nBiu41nHiaQ,"It's easy to see why there's ALWAYS a line here. Most chicken places seem to focus on the sides with the idea that chicken is chicken. That isn't the case here. The chicken is tender and juicy. 
I'm not into super hot, so I'll let others say if it's hot enough. We tried the mild. Sides were ok, but the real appeal here, fittingly, is the chicken.",,
-9P5izxucGrMSU1kBUIR8w,,"Wow... I guess I shouldn't have waited over a year to review this place!  We go here whenever we visit New Orleans and we love it every time.  We always sit at the bar...b/c the line for a table is usually 25 people long out the front door...and it's just better to sit at the bar!  
I love it here...and you will too!",
-9_Nz6wJ9Rj0q7kq6YJ-MA,"Wow the line is LONG. Order online and pick it up, will be much faster. The chicken is worth it. So flavorful, medium was just enough heat for me. The potatoe salad is delish, Mac n cheese is pretty good. You get quite a bit of food with each meal, I couldn't finish mine. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",,
-9bbOgdO8YCd4FzMm2Y5nA,,"Acmes was the first place we ate at in new orleans! The line was long but it was worth the wait. We got chargrilled oysters to start and the flavor was great! Disappointed in the size of them but i know that sometimes cannot be helped. We also did not really like the server service :( in the beginning he was snappy but he lighten up towards the end! For my entree I got the seafood platter. I did not expect it to be that much food but it was!! The fried oysters were my favorite part!! The seasoning was sooooo good. I would definitely come back! If you're in downtown new orleans, I would go stop in!",
-9iuWpif2Tc9ltyo1POdiA,,Yummy! Raw oysters and char grilled oysters...... both to die for! I ate the char grilled ones but was able to take a picture first. Make sure to grab that bread and dip it in the seasoning from the oysters. The second round of oysters were raw and I couldn't wait long enough to remember to take a picture so all you get is the photo of the empty plate. =),
#NAME?,,,"Ordered crawfish étoufée. Came with a mound of undercooked white rice in the center. And it was hard finding any crawfish floating around in the red sauce. Don't think there was much of it. Was supposed to have been spicy, but it was barely that. Service was fast and friendly, but I'd have gladly waited a few more minutes if it meant avoiding crunchy rice. I walked out hungry and $20 bucks poorer."
#NAME?,,,"AMAZING!!
You cannot leave New Orleans without trying the redfish house dish! I would eat that everyday if I could, and I also loved every aspect of the service"
#NAME?,,,"Stopped here for dinner on our first night in NOLA, after it being recommended by our hotel's concierge. The atmosphere is fun and casual, and the food is great. I had the vegetarian pasta, since I do not eat meat or seafood. It was delicious - made with a Cajun Alfredo sauce. The other two people I was with had seafood platters and said they were stellar. Our waiter, Michael, was excellent. He was very welcoming and informative about the French Quarter area. We had a great conversation with him and the couple next to our table. Overall great experience at Oceana! We will definitely be back."
#NAME?,,"We loved this place! Both grilled and raw oysters amazing, fried oyster and shrimp po-boy was the best. Ask to sit at the bar and experience Hollywood and Stormin Norman! In addition to great food, they provided us with a memorable experience. We tried other oyster restaurants and this was our favorite. Highly recommend and will visit again!",
#NAME?,,,"Food was amazing. I got the seafood platter. I'm not an oyster fan so i got double shrimp instead....the portions were more than enough. I got my order to go, and the food was wrapped sooo nicely that it stayed hot. Only change i would make would be to separate the meat from fries with foil. The condensation makes the food soggy. The cocktail sauce had the perfect spice to it. I ordered a drink to go and the bartender did her thing. Will definitely be returning. Price was worth it once i saw how much food i actually had."
#NAME?,"I ordered the small portion of dark meat - a leg and thigh - with medium spice. The portion size was perfect, and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I wish I had gone with the hot spice level, though, as medium wasn't very spicy at all. The pimento mac & cheese side was like no other I've had. A surprising flavor that really worked. The black eyed peas salad was a touch oily, but I still enjoyed it. It had a ton of vegetables and a nice tangy zip to it. A note to vegetarians - it is cooked in bacon. I was hosting my work team in from around the country and heavily researched the best hot chicken in Nashville. I highly recommend Hattie B's! The online ordering was super convenient (particularly for a group), and having read how small the place is, the decision to pick it up and eat at Centennial Park was a good one.","You really have to plan your visit to Acme, due to the seemingly endless long lines at all hours of the day. However, we found the sweet spot with a 4:00 pm meal time and were seated very quickly. I love raw oysters and Acme's did not disappoint. Just a warning, they use A LOT of horseradish in the sauce served with the oysters, which made my eyes water but did not diminish my appreciation for them at all. To round out my sampling of every NO specialty I could have on a weekend visit, I also had chicken gumbo and red beans and rice. The gumbo was perfectly acceptable, but nothing out of the ordinary. I really loved the red beans and rice - perfectly cooked with a wonderful blend of spices. Our meal was worth the several failed attempts we made to get in, and I'd recommend it to anyone on their first trip to the city.","Oceana Grill offers a menu with a wide variety of options and is conveniently located in the French Quarter. I had raw oysters, gator tail and crab cakes - ordering off the appetizer menu for a party of two. The oysters were awesome, and they don't go overboard on the horseradish. The crab cakes are a specialty and came highly recommended from a friend who lives in the area. The appetizer portion is two very large cakes. The cake was moist and perfectly cooked, topped with a cream mushroom sauce. I'd never had crab cakes topped with this type of sauce, but it really worked. For the gator tail, we couldn't decide between fried or blackened, so our server suggested we get half and half. They were a bit chewy, but were still very good. I was a little surprised the blackened ones were breaded and fried as well, but the flavor profile was definitely different between the two. We had great, friendly service and were able to walk in at 6:30pm on a Monday night with no wait for a table."
#NAME?,,,"Our first day in New Orleans we were referred to the Oceana for lunch in the French Quarter.  What a wonderful treat for a middle aged couple from the Midwest. The catfish PoBoy was out of this world. The red fish was just as good.  The collard greens were also awesome and won my heart over. I finished the serving wanting for more. The oysters with the sauce (sorry I don't remember it's name , but the dish is an Oceana signature appetizer) was out of this world.  Even my husband. who is not a fan of oysters, finished the sauce on the plate with the bread provided. Make sure you don't miss it. Thank you to our server Errol for all your suggestions and for making our 1st time at Oceana so memorable."
#NAME?,,,"I ate here on a Saturday afternoon with a party of five. The restaurant was fairly empty, yet our service was incredibly slow. We waited ten minutes for refills on our water and when our check came, we waited 15 more minutes for the waitress to return our cards. Not only was the food subpar for New Orleans, but the waitress mischarged my card for 3x the amount of my meal. I was on the phone not only with their accounting department but also with my bank for 2 hours because the waitress overdrafted my account for several days. My bank will not reverse the fee as it was not a banking error, and the restaurant will not take responsibility for their inept waitress. I am highly disappointed with the service I received and will not be returning any time in the future.

Food was too expensive for the quality I received. Southern hospitality my ass."
-Bo3nX8KSLzUSYVS-6c5Ag,,The long line is not worth the wait. Save yourself the time and go somewhere else. When we finally got in and ordered my food was super cold and bland. Part of the reason to come to New Orleans is the food...this was not a good representation! Won't go back!,I've gone a few times. But for some reason this time was the best! My friend and I shared the crawfish fries. Ssssoooo gooooood! My pasta was delicious as well. The hostess and waitress were very pleasant and nice. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to provide recommendations. Will definitely be be back!
-C7MpxOxrm5p9me2MMkL8Q,"Thank you Yelp for another great recommendation! We caught Hattie B.'s at a good time, around 8:30 on a rainy night and there was barely a line. Our uber driver said we were very lucky as it is usually packed. The staff was very friendly and gave us samples of two different local beers when we were having trouble deciding between the two. We got a large white plate, medium that they split between two plates for us. The chicken was spicy but flavorful and they sides were great. We enjoyed the outdoor seating and good music they had playing while finishing our pitcher of local brew. Would definitely go back next time we're in the area.",,
#NAME?,Simply amazing food and friendly service. Chicken tenders were the best I've ever had. Sides were good. Loved by locals and tourists alike. Try it!,,
#NAME?,,"Sit at the bar! It's great watching the shuckers, who are friendly and welcoming. Plus, you're wait will be significantly less. The char broiled oysters are the best we've ever had. Worth every penny!",
#NAME?,"lives upto the hype, good chicken w/ spicy as you want it. giving 4stars instead of 5 cos we found Gus chicken (Memphis) tastier. waited 45 mins on a weekday non-busy time in line lol but overall worth it. V friendly and quick service",,
#NAME?,,,"The wait was not long, the service was great and the food was delicious! My husband and I shared a cup of gumbo and crab cakes to start. I got the blackened red fish-the mustard greens were delish! And my husband got the shrimp po boy. We both liked my dish better than his, although we enjoyed the whole experience! Prime location!"
#NAME?,"Wow, this place definitely lives up to its reviews. I visited a couple weeks ago on a wknd trip to Nashville, and hot chicken was on my ""must try"" list. I chose to go with the mild tenders, as I didn't want to hurt myself (lol).  The chicken is delicious, very moist and fried well. At first I was afraid I had gone too light on the spice, but after a few bites the heat started to build, and I knew I made the right choice. I got mac & cheese and greens as my sides, thinking they would help cool my palate...I was wrong! Both had a bit of a kick too them. 
The only downside was the wait, but I came prepared with a book in hand. Can't wait to stop by again next time I visit Nashville.",,
#NAME?,,"Fried oysters, fried oysters, waiting months to go and order these.  Had twice on the trip!  I heard the debris roast beef sandwich was good too.  Crazy though, so you better show up EARLY if you want to get seated.",
#NAME?,,,The wait was long but worth it! Staff was great and friendly. Our meal was great along with our appetizer. We celebrated our one year wedding anniversary here and glad we chose this gem. Very popular and always busy but worth the wait! The grilled shrimp plate was amazing!!!
#NAME?,"Went there the first time two days ago.  It was busy.  I ordered the i/2 chicken dark meat with 2 sides- the pimento mac and cheese and the greens.  First, there was not much meat on the chicken and once I  got passed the skin there was no flavor. The mac and cheese was very creamy but lacking any real significant quality. The greens were also lacking flavor. Later on I got an upset stomach-probably due to the greace in the chicken.
First and last visit to this place.",,
#NAME?,,,Soo disappointed in Oceana Grill. We went by to get a pecan praline brownie sundae to go. I really enjoyed chatting with the super nice gentleman at the door. Left with our sundae and went down to Armstrong park to enjoy it. The brownie was hard as a rock!!  And the barely there praline and pecans that might have saved it were way to few to help. So almost $12 for a dessert that we threw away. I'm glad we didn't get lunch there.
#NAME?,,"Honestly at a loss to describe the draw. Mediocre food, long lines, crowded seating. There's 100 better restaurants within a 5 minute walk. Felix's is basically a higher quality version of the same thing, and Luke has far higher quality oytsers.",
#NAME?,,"Kinda disappointed after all the hype I've heard over this place.  Kinda proves my suspicion that maybe overly hyped restaurants aren't THAT great.  We waited in line for about 45 minutes only to find out that crawfish was out of season and they weren't boiling anything in the kitchen.  I ended up getting a small bowl of the seafood etouffee.  It was good, and that's all I will say.  We got a dozen oysters as an appetizer and I will admit that I have had better.  Still tasty but not satisfying my expectations.  Oh well...off to my next stop.",
#NAME?,"I was expecting fried chicken with spice. Similar to chicken wings. Not the same thing at all.  I got the mild, because i'm not a spicy eater, hubby got the hot.  Sides were sides, ok, good enough to eat, but nothing to write home about. 

Hubby decided hot was not a big enough challenge so went back for the ""shut the cluck up"" hottest flavor. He said it had spice, but still not the hottest he's ever had.  

To me? It seemed like fried chicken with greasy spicy sauce under the skin.  Maybe it's just me? I will say the chicken was cooked perfectly! nice and moist, and it was good. Just not what i was expecting. 

Will i go back? Probably not, but I live in Arizona, so a trip would be a bit expensive. LOL.",,
#NAME?,,,"Got a recommendation from my hotel on char grilled oysters and Oceana didn't fail to deliver. A few blocks up the street from my hotel and off Bourbon Street this some what obscure place comes across as your typical tourist location with a sign out from ""Line Starts Here"", fortunately I was somewhat early so I missed the dinner crowd. I sat at the bar and it was pretty full all over, and I took the menu and went for Oceana's famous Char-grilled Oysters. I ordered a dozen and what I got was incredible, there were 12 nice plump oysters that had been char-grilled with a unique zesty garlic and cream herb Cajun sauce, finished with a fresh blend of Parmesan and Romano cheeses. It was plenty food for me and I was completely satisfied."
#NAME?,,,"I Enjoyed the red beans & rice, fried shrimp & gumbo. The service & the food was equally good.  My friends were satisfied with their orders as well, I would eat here again."
#NAME?,,"Ummmm............
It's ok......
Not goot time for dining during Covid...
It was long line.
Very popular here.",
#NAME?,"the kind of meal that makes you sad when it's over. I tried to get Hattie Bs a few years ago & couldn't wait on the long line. I found out tonight that I had clearly missed out. 

Before I talk about the food, I need to say that the staff are unbelievably nice and accommodating. I ordered online & needed to add an item to my order before leaving. They made it happen quickly! Excellent service. 

I'm always nervous when taking fried food to go, as it can often get soggy in transport. The chicken tasted right-out-of-the-fryer crispy. I ordered mine hot (small dark plate) and the sauce was GOOD AND HOT! 

Sides: cole slaw, collard greens, Mac & cheese.. all so good. And an extra order of pickles, because why not?

An inexpensive and delicious meal that I wish I could eat regularly!",,
#NAME?,Um. Delicious. Eat the Mac and Cheese. I'm a midwesterner who can't handle spicy things and it was great! Got mild spicy but probably could have done medium. Would love to come back the next time I'm in Nashville.,,
#NAME?,"i have been wanting to try some nashville hot chicken for a couple of years. finally made it back to town and tried Hattie's. eat hot chicken here! luckily placed our order online while traveling towards nash. hot and ready to pick up upon arrival. i was in the place less than a minute and it was BUSY! had regular fried and medium. both were amazing, flavorful, and juicy. potato salad was great. i would eat here anytime but considering the line i saw at 1145 on a sunday i would place the order online",,
#NAME?,One of the best hot chicken places in Nashville. Highly suggest the hot tenders with fries and mac n' cheese!,,
#NAME?,,,"New Orleans during COVID? Oceana is the standard in what restaurants are and should do.  Masks, gloves , shields, social distanced tables...thank you for always a great experience, food and atmosphere"
#NAME?,,,The food was very good. Great service and helpfull in selecting what to eat. First time in New Orleans.
#NAME?,,"Came here with a group of 11, so the wait was long, but worth it. Came at 8:45 and took about 45 minutes to get a table set up for us. 

Fresh oysters were delicious but the CHARGRILLED IS WHERE IT'S AT. A friend of mine stated that she didn't like oysters but tried the fresh ones here and actually liked them!

Also got the boo fries, which were good but a tad salty. 

I'll return for the chargrilled oysters. MMM.",
#NAME?,,,"I enjoyed my dish. It was great but I have had better cajun food. No worries though, you will walk out of there satisfied if you order the right thing"
#NAME?,,"Stood in line for an hour and a half the evening before St. Patrick's Day, and boy was it worth it! The atmosphere inside is bustling and unique.

I tried the blackened oysters, which were absolutely scrumptious and some of the best I'd ever had. Also tried the fried fish po boy, and the fried catfish that came with it was perfectly cooked.

Overall a great experience, and a must try in New Orleans.",
-H3oJd-9HLbhwRvtX2WTZA,,,"Got the Cajun pasta and an order of the alligator bites (1/2 order fried, 1/2 order blackened). Everything was amazing! I want the recipe for the pasta!"
#NAME?,,"Honestly, was the server so flighty that she charged someone else's food to our check as well as our food!  And to top it off, she could barely get back to our table to check to see if we needed anything else.   That's the main reason for my negative review of this popular tourist establishment.   

First off, the waiting line is literally a line where you wait outside above a smelly sewer drain.  You want the wait for their food and service to be worth the stench you have to endure for 10-45 minutes.  Food-  meh, their fried shrimp was a tad over done, and if you want the sauce(mayo and Tabasco) then you cough up another .50.   The oyster lovers in the group enjoyed those oysters on the half shell.   Overall food, not as great as some of the smaller dive places on the city.  Service-  definitely needs to step it up a bit.   The servers seemed over worked thus didn't know who ordered what.",
#NAME?,"Food was delicious, nothing healthy but what can you expect at a fried chicken joint. The service was very slow",,
#NAME?,"This was worth the wait! I ordered the dark meat chicken hot with a side of potato salad. It was the best fried chicken and potato salad I've ever had. Super juicy, perfect spice level, and the crispy skin was sooo good. The other hot chicken dishes I've had in Nashville don't even compare.

There was a one hour line at 530pm on a Saturday.",,
#NAME?,,,"The meal was fair.  The poor boy bun was like plain white bread with little flavor.  Cat fish was ok  Blackened redfish was good but we have had better.  Its better than average Bourbon street but there is better food in town.  It is good that they serve till 1pm.  Our waiter Chris was excellent!  Very attentive, friendly and easy to engage.  He could train other Bourbon street waitstaff."
#NAME?,,,"We came thrue from Los Angeles and were looking for a seafood spot as well as something with vegan options on the menu.
We were very happy with this place.
Craw fish  etouffee   was delicious as was a veggie stew.
Great service to top it off and we have a winner."
#NAME?,"Had to try this Nashville staple. Long wait. Mediocre  mac and cheese.  Fries has some kinda batter on them, didn't like. Banana pudding was way too sweet. But the  chicken (medium spice) was outstanding!  Also the sweet tea is awesome and the staff extremely friendly",,
#NAME?,"Came here because I was told this is the place to get hot chicken. I think this is more of a 3.5 stars. While the chicken was tasty, I don't think it was worth the hype or the long wait. If there was not a line, or it was not as hyped I may not have been as disappointed. 

I think for visitors it is still worth a try, but not sure if you need to go out of your way to get hot chicken.",I stayed at the Wyndham Hotel over Mardi Gras and always passed by this restaurant. I kept thinking to myself why is there always a long line. I had previously heard about Acme Oyster House from YouTube and I had it on my list but I didn't know that it was this good. Because of the line I almost ended not coming here. Luckily on my last day I decided to lineup and see what the fuss is about. I ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters and a dozen for oysters mind you this was all for myself. Wow was I Blown Away. Everyone talks about the chargrilled oysters the amazing garlic butter sauce in the bread they give you to dip in the sauce. Just absolutely amazing you must order. However what really surprised me was also how good the raw oysters were. They were sweet juicy and very meaty. Overall you must come here when you're in New Orleans for oysters. Suck it up and wait in line.,
-IFSBZCOHnHm1-3p5V493g,Tried the half chicken hot and wings. I guess I just don't like fried chicken as I struggled to eat anything. Sides were all gross. Not my kind of restaurant.,,
#NAME?,"This is my favorite Nashville Hot Chicken place so far. I know it might be sacrilege to elevate this past Princes and some other local favorites, but this was the tastiest Hot Chicken I've had. The ordering online was a piece of cake, and the parking was not too bad. Although how Gigi's got 5 spots to HB's one I'll not ever understand.

I got the first level of hotness leg quarter, which came on the prerequisite white bread slice and two pickle chips on top. The chicken was fried perfectly and the skin was oh so crunchy and hot. 

Bonus was the single seat table that was waiting for me as everyone else had come in groups. Extra Bonus, was the Sweet Tea, perfectly brewed and sweet. Total cost out the door with parking, sweet tea, and chicken was $9.48. 

I cannot wait to go again, and bring some chicken loving friends!",,
#NAME?,,"Got here Friday night and of course there's a line. Not too bad but we thought we were early enough to beat the crowd. Took about 30 minutes as we didn't want to sit at the bar and wanted a table. Immediately we ordered the raw oysters, chargrilled oysters and oyster shooters to start. They came out in a reasonable time but drinks took a bit longer than expected. Fresh oysters were great but not shucked as cleanly as I was constantly biting into shells and such. Chargrilled oysters as usual were amazing and of course had to have the obligatory oyster shooters which taste as one would expect oyster, vodka and hot sauce to taste like. Still hungry I ordered the peace maker po boy which claims to the #4 best sandwich. Not sure by whom but I tried it and I can't say it was worthy. It's good but not #4 good. The Tabasco infused sauce was very weak and bland and I'm surprised it didn't come with fries. Honestly though, I only came here for the oysters and they did good on that so I won't complain.",
#NAME?,,,"Gumbo...yes please.  Grab an ABITA AMBER...cold!  Our waitress was hilarious...her asst dude...yikes.  No Clue.  He went to set down a beer on our table...after we received our beers...and us being honest people said we already got ours.  But if you want to leave it we will drink it.  We did not care if we had to pay for it.  He says...Oh No...and picks it up and acts like he is going to drink it...being a total Dbag....spills it on himself.  So we laughed like, hello that is what you get.  The table next to us laughed also.  Bc I guess he was jerk to them also at some point.  Then the 4 of us all got along and exchanged conversation...until we got their tab...we quickly sent it to them.  hahaha.  We did not have to wait for a table and you can tell this is a touristy place...but the reviews are great and it was a quick easy bite with a decent menu."
#NAME?,,"RAw Oysters are pretty good (taste more fresh than Felix across the street). Fried soft shell crab and the seafood gumbo are tasty as well (except a little bit too salty). Line wasn't long when we went at about 3:30, but the food took more than 30 mins, and it's hard to get attention if you're sitting at the corner of the bar and the waiter won't come unless you call him/her.",
#NAME?,"Hattie Bs never lets you down. I always go for the medium because I enjoy having taste buds.  All the sides are good, I'm especially aa fan of the pimento Mac and cheese and the black bean salad. The fries are also good.  If you don't feel like waiting in line for hours calling in ahead and grub hub are  good options.",,
#NAME?,I don't usually eat fried chicken but I could eat here every day and be happy. I had the hot chicken sandwich and it was fantastic. the fries were a little stale but the sandwich more than made up for it. The staff was so kind and checked on me several times. I'll be back next time I'm in Nashville.,,
#NAME?,"Sad to say we did not think this place was worth the hype or the 45 minute wait. Once we got inside, it smelled legitimately like puke, so not very appetizing. I will say the Mac and cheese was good, and the flavor of the sauce (I got the lowest heat level above no heat, boyfriend got the sandwich) was good, but it didn't make up for the fact that both our chicken was dry/overcooked to the point that some pieces were unedible. I'm giving a courtesy third star because maybe we should have just ordered chicken with bones in it, not both boneless options, in order to taste what the hype is all about. Either way I've definitely had far better fried chicken elsewhere.",,
#NAME?,"Delicious chicken and great beer selection! We did wait in line for about 20-30 mins but it was part of the experience. (Like a lot of the newer ""hip"" restaurants in Nashville) the backyard patio area was really nice. We played bags while we waited for the food to come to the table. It was great evening with friends so it was ok that the whole experience took some time. We got to catch up in line and out on the sweet patio.",,
#NAME?,"Hattie B. Yum. Medium heat small dark platter, mac&chz, baked beans, Dark beer. Saturday night at 9pm. Table of 6 friends. So good. Was my dinner #2 a little pricey? Yeah. Did they get a few side dishes of my friends' orders wrong? YUP. Did that mean they gave me an extra thing of baked beans? Yeah. I thought that was nice. We didn't wait very long for food (it WAS 9pm after all.) Our table had a range of Southern tenders with ranch dressing to Large Damn Hot white plate. Most side dishes were represented. Most were delivered correctly. Everyone enjoyed their food! 

I certainly did. My boyfriend was the Damn Hot order and he cried a little bit (especially the next morning....) but he also loved it.

Also can I say again how I love that Hattie B serves beer? How have I never had hot chicken with beer? 

I'll be back, B.",,
#NAME?,,"The Chargrilled Oysters are to die for! Yes, there is a huge line to get in but once you eat the amazing food, you will understand that it is worth waiting for. I was in NOLA for a festival at the time, but if I am ever in the area then I will  absolutely come back.",
#NAME?,"Got the chicken and while we enjoyed it, it was not worth the $8 parking, long line and outdoor heat. The mac n cheese was delicious. Did not like their fries.",,
#NAME?,"Was driving through Nashville and stopped by HattieB's based on Yelp recommendation for Hot Chicken. Ordered the leg thigh combination - hot and damn hot spice levels. Word of caution: have the damn hot only if you have the balls to digest it. ""Damn hot"" is very very spicy, took me a good 10 minutes or more to recover from the first bite. However, I noticed that it basically has the ""hot"" level of spice, topped off with a black-ish coating of additional spice, giving it the ""damn hot"" title. 

I would recommend the medium/hot spice levels to have a good enjoyable meal. The chicken is great. Sides are ok-ish. Drinks are not served cold and on a hot day, that needs A LOT of ice. Seating is limited, with most of it being outdoors on a deck/patio. There are only 4-5 spots for HattieB customers, with additional paid parking options (at $6-$8 an hour). 

I would say a good first time experience of the southern hot chicken. Have it with an iced coke!",,
-K5-6hDN7gcNMJo_ChNtCg,"Was in Nashville for a bachelor party, one of the groomsman found this place that's one of the best Nashville chicken, and man was he right.

I ordered the half chicken with the damn hot, the second hottest option and man did I love it and also regret it. The spices on here was perfect, chicken was cooked perfectly. And the thing about white meat is usually dry or under seasoned but I don't know how they got it seasoned and not dry. The sides I gotten were probably good, but my mouth was in too much pain from the spice that I couldn't tasted it. I gotten the Mac n cheese and fries, hoping to help the spice out.

Overall, i will definitely come back to this place and get the same spice level of chicken. It was numbing but I love the spicy food so I might even come back to try the hottest chicken they have.",,
#NAME?,"I really enjoyed Hattie B's. Great chicken. I got dark large, greens, mac and cheese, and apple cobbler. Loved the chicken. Good breading and taste. Very juicy. Greens were home style, just the way I like them. I LOVED the pimento mac and thought it was a great twist. Apple cobbler was good, a dollop of hommade whipped cream or ice cream would've put it over the top.",,
#NAME?,,,There was a long line but we were seated less than 15 minutes.  The waitress was very friendly and made you feel welcome.  The food was superb.  This is a great place to go for creole and cajun food in the same place.
#NAME?,,,"The gator tail was a real experience! We had half blackened, half fried. Blackened definitely spicier!
The jambalaya was good, reminded me of paella. 
Try the hurricane, really good cocktail!
Service was okay, nothing exceptional."
#NAME?,,,Food was just ok. I feel like people hype this place up more than its deserved. The food was seasoned well. The alligator was gross and the oysters had no flavor. The service wasn't great.
#NAME?,"My boyfriend and I love hot chicken and Hattie B's was the most recommended place in Nashville. It's GOOD, but not GREAT, and the line makes it not quite worth it. The chicken is good, but it's not as spicy as we would like. If you like the spicy food at least go with the 'HOT' option. Overall, good food, but better options.",,
#NAME?,,,"It's not bad.  Neither is it great.  It's ok.  It's the Denny's of our visit to NOLA, and if you want a drink with flavor or finesse I suggest elsewhere.  My hurricane leaned very much to the softer side.  It was made festive by a bubbling piece of dry ice.  I told our server that I had my first hurricane down the block at the Red Fish Grill and I thought someone had slapped me.  He surprised me by saying, ""Well that's a higher end place isn't it?""  I didn't quite know how to answer him.  I thought the prices were about the same.  The cost of the hurricane sure was at $10. Although the Red Fish Grill did qualify their hurricane as a ""Category 5 Hurricane""

The flavor of the gumbo was very good but it really bothered us having to work past the rock-hard bits of rice that clearly came from someone scraping the rice cooker to get every last bit of rice into our bowl.  The softshell crab was good.  

In the end, I guess our server was right.  I should have lowered my expectations.  Not bad, not good.  Just ok at best."
#NAME?,"At Hattie B's it's always HOTTT! 

Coming from Chicago, it was my first time visiting Nashville so I definitely had to see what the hype was all about at Hattie B's! NEVER had a hot chicken before but this is the place to go if you're gonna try it! 

Expect a long line, but it moves pretty quickly and is worth the wait. 

My bf and I got the hot chicken sandwich, hot chicken thighs, peach cobbler w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream (BEST COMBO), and sides: pimento mac n cheese, red skin potato salad (not pictured), and baked beans (not pictured). We had leftovers for days because of how filling the food is.

You HAVE to come here if you're in Nashville!",,
#NAME?,"We stood in the hot Nashville summer sun today for 35 minutes for this chicken and it was worth every bite. It was the perfect amount of breading and crispness. I chose the ""Hot"" and drizzled honey on it as the employee suggested. Bingo! I'll be back. 

The line situation could probably be handled better, there was an old lady in front of me feeling ill from the heat.",,
#NAME?,,This place is by far my favorite place in New Orleans! The chargrilled oysters are to die for!,
#NAME?,,,"We were in New Orleans two weeks after Ida, and many places were not yet reopened.  This was the only place we heard of that was open past 11pm.  Oceana was recommended by a few people, so we were excited to go.

We realize that with hurricanes, Covid and employee shortages, things are not ideal.  However, we had great food at other places and were impressed with many other restaurants and dining experiences.

Pros:  The Cajun Pasta and Mardi Gras Pasta were great, with good flavor and lots of seafood.  The Ultimate Bloody Mary was literally an entire meal - so much food stuck into it that it could easily have filled one person to the brim.  Flavor of bloody Mary was good, but not perfect.

Cons:  EVERY SINLGE PIECE of fried seafood was very overcooked.  Like, VERY.  Oysters should not be chewy, but these were so dry that it was gross.  The baked oysters were overcooked and they forgot to bring them for 45 minutes,  They did bring us barbecued shrimp, which we didn't order.

This place may improve with more training for the employees.  We spent $200 and could only eat less than half of what we ordered because the fried items were so overcooked.  

Service person was very sweet."
#NAME?,,"Very good. Fast service. You must order the chargrilled oysters and the gumbo. There was a line but it went quickly. I heard Felixs next door was also really good, if you don't want to wait.",
#NAME?,"Lonely tourist at a conference enjoys delicious 2nd-to-hottest chicken sandwich in friendly, pleasant environment, story to follow.
I am in Nashville for a conference and I just had to try hot chicken. I couldn't round up a group because I'm lazy so I went by myself and had a very nice and totally delicious experience. The sandwich had the perfect level of heat and the coleslaw was the perfect complement. It was less busy than usual due to the early hour and rain, so I clucked out (see what I did there?). 
So, it may not be the 1st hot chicken in Nashville, but they did right by me. I'm missing it already.",,

The line gets pretty long but it's well worth the wait.","CATFISH PO-BOY OUTSTANDING!!!!... I came here late night after a concert last Tuesday. I ordered the char-grilled oysters in addition to my po-boy. The oysters were just ok, I guess I'm use to the way the char-grilled oysters are prepared at ACME. The catfish po-boy definitely made up for it... very flavorful and fried hard, just how I like it!!!.. The fries were good too..big serving size as well.  My waitress.. I forget her name, she seemed very tired but still managed to service our table with a smile and gave us everything we needed. I left her a nice tip."
#NAME?,,If I have to ask you ever time I need a drink I would think you would get it after the fith time,
#NAME?,,"I wasn't going to write a review on this place because I was only there once while visiting and I didn't have any oysters, so I figured my review would be pointless.   However, it's been 2 months since I was in New Orleans and I still think about the Acme Oyster House.

It all started with a morning walk down Iberville where I passed some trucks loading fresh oysters into the restaurant.   I can't stand oysters, but the freshness did peak my interest.  So I gathered my friends and off we went.

I started with a bloody mary because it was necessary.   (Excellent pickled green beans btw).   My friends all ordered oysters but I ordered the New Orleans medley.  (sampling of seafood gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and smoked sausage).    Everything was fabulous and completely hit the spot but the jambalaya stood out from the rest.   It was perfectly flavored with a hearty almost tangy taste, and complimented the smoke sausage better than most things I've sampled.

I've been trying to recreate their jambalaya at home and have failed miserably.  I've also tried it at other restaurants and it's not the same.   I've now resorted to finding a reason to go back to New Orleans and just camp out there.   

My friends all slurped their oysters down and raved at the excellent taste, so I guess this place lives up to its name.  But if you ever feal like venturing off oyster highway, give the medly a try.",
#NAME?,,,"The Mardi Gras Pasta was amazing, and loaded with shrimp and crawfish. The crab cakes were excellent."
#NAME?,,"Lines tell you this is one of the best restaurants in NOLA on the street. Classic cooking and poboys with all the trimmings. Good for family reunions and events. They have champagne, wine and all the basic booze. Nice bar and decor. Service was good although the wait isn't, but if you keep drinking the bourbon from next door its a party and time flies...",
#NAME?,Great spot for hot chicken. Had the large dark meat hot tasted great. Loved the sweet tea. Friendly staff. Self assigned seating. Definitely recommend.,,
#NAME?,"I've been a few times, and even though I'm not the biggest fan of spicy, the chicken was amazing, as well as the sides. Definitely must give it a shot",,
#NAME?,,"Do you stand in line on the street in the freezing cold for the 20 minute wait?
Absolutely!!!  Without a doubt. 

Why???  

Cause Momma like.  A lot!!!  And, You will too!!!

I'm not a huge oyster fan.  They remind me of snot. 
This is the exception.  
Oyster heaven.
Grilled to perfection with herbs, butter and cheese. 
Hell, you can probably take a monkey turd and cook it in all this delicious yumminess and I'd like it too. But, you try it first.

Back to the oysters, just do it.  You will end up ordering more and more and more.

The roast beef sandwich was a 2 1/2 star and the fried seafood sandwich (po boy) was left 1/2 full (see, I'm optimistic).

Keep it simple:
Drinks. Grilled Oysters. Done.

I would have loved to try the bananas foster, but it was a tease.  No mo.",
#NAME?,,,"Wish we'd have gone to Acme instead. Our server couldn't have cared less to make it an enjoyable experience for us. The customer is never wrong & just because 1 guest at the table of 5 is (politely & quietly) intoxicated (ie- had trouble placing order & spilled a drink) does not give reason to assume we are all a bunch of wasted tourists. Glad we made reservations to avoid waiting in the long line. Bummed they didn't even have their famous grilled oysters (because of gas line being broken)? We learned later that our buddy who couldn't make the trip called in drinks for the table, but those never showed. Not hurrying back."
#NAME?,"Stop in for some chicken, sides and sweet tea....you won't be disappointed.  The location we went to was currently under construction so it was loud and a bit dusty.",,
#NAME?,,"You know, a lot of people, specifically locals, give this place a lot of flack for being a tourist trap. And maybe it is, a little bit. However, I've been to Acme probably two dozen times in my life, and I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal. Have I ever had an OUTSTANDING meal there? Probably now. But that's ok, it is what it is. Fried seafood po' boys, red beans and rice, and of course, oysters. Their raw selection has always been good, their po' boys pretty standard, and their chargrilled not too far off from Drago's. So, don't let the snooty locals fool you. If you want an introduction to po' boys and oysters, it's ok if you go to acme.",
#NAME?,,,I love Bre! She took care of my birthday group of 13 and had excellent service! This place has really good food as well! I will be back!
-R3JuvY4G4x-SYp0-X40MA,,,2 days in a row here I had Errol on Day 1 and Bridget T. on day 2. Both were great and the food was awesome!! Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting.
-RC14j_igct9Cb-PpKu6kw,,,"Top notch! Everything was delicious and our server Pamela was the best we've ever encountered. So nice, bubbly and full of information!"
#NAME?,,,"I keep on thinking of New Orleans everytime i think of Oceana Grill! this place is a must to visit and enjoy their delish foods when you visit New Orleans! good Customer Service and the place is always packed!!! good food, a bit pricey but worth the money!!! if you love oysters, dont forget to get that tray of raw oyster! what a treat!"
#NAME?,,"A place that has been around for 100 years must be doing something right...do not be put off by the long lines outside...the food is well worth any wait!  We went back to Acme 2 times in 3 days...the food, the service and the staff are great.  I'd highly recommend the chargrilled oysters, the raw oysters (of course), the Boo Fries, and the New Orleans Medley with chicken.",
#NAME?,,,Great first meal in New Orleans. Shrimp platter was piled so high couldn't even eat it all. Great Hurricane. Service was amazing. Crawfish Étouffée was to die for. Friendly waitress with lots of info on the city.
#NAME?,"This place delivered with the hype of their Tennessee hot chicken. Parking stinks nearby so I'd walk or Uber if at all possible. We came right during a huge thunderstorm and I think that's the only reason we got in without a wait. But it was worth braving the storm. We split a large white chicken meal with cole slaw, fries, and extra pickles. I didn't even try the slaw because I was too consumed with the chicken. We got it medium and I could've done with mild because it was, indeed, HOT chicken. I'm not complaining, though. SO crispy and tasty. At first, my fiancée said the fries looked like crinkle cut Ore-ida but when we started eating them, we changed our minds. They were also spicy, though you couldn't see any seasoning on them. The large was perfect to split between two hungry people. Pickles were good too, not sure what special things they do to them but it's clear they're home-prepared. Be weary of eating the bread that comes under the chicken because it has soaked up allllll that leftover hot chicken sauce. Though I'm pretty sure it's meant to soothe your burning palate, not the case! I have a feeling I'm going to be getting hot chicken cravings in the near future...",,
#NAME?,,"I'm not a big oyster person.  But holy cow are they AMAZING here!  Chargrilled to perfection!! Even if you think you don't like oysters, try them herr!!",
#NAME?,"The first time I went to Hattie B's I wasn't impressed. I like spicy food I was looking for something that would wow me! I went to the Midtown location with a friend who highly recommended it. After looking over the menu I got the tenders in medium since the cashier told me that was pretty spicy. After waiting for about 20 minutes for our food to cook I finally got to try my tenders, which I was excited for. However, when I took a bite I wasn't impressed. It wasn't spicy at all. I felt as if I was eating KFC or something I could have cooked at home. I gave it another try about a year later but at the Charlotte location (which is much bigger) this time I got the small white plate in hot. Hattie B's certainly redeemed themselves this time, it was spicy and the wait wasn't nearly as long. I guess you just have to wing it to see exactly what you like.",,
#NAME?,,"Charbroiled oysters are to die for! So delish the we order seconds. The boom boom shrimp, gumbo, oyster Rockefeller was pretty good too! Go early if you can. Dinner line is crazy.",
#NAME?,,"Long wait and average food. Wasn't blown away as hyped. We waited about 40 minutes to be seated and 20 more minutes before we could order anything. That too wasn't in a pick hour.
The charcoaled oysters weren't too bad but the friend crab was stripped off it's juices and was nothing more than fried batter. The voodoo fries were underwhelming and disappointing",
#NAME?,,Aaaaamazing! I hate oysters! The char boiled oysters soaked in butter and garlic has changed my life forever fried alligator tails and po boy sandwich is a must as well! Service was wonderful! Acme is a must!,Aaaamazing!!! Beautiful Interior! Drinks are bomb! Food is out of this world. Service is excellent! Servers are kind and welcoming !!! Thank you Oceana !
#NAME?,,,"This place was recommended to me by the consierge at the hotel I was staying at. 

I was very hungry following a long drive from Florida and arrived at Oceana Grill sometime after 5 p.m. local time. The place was relatively empty and I sat down at the bar. The bartender served me up a Nola on tap (allowing me to sample it in a small glass prior to). It tasted pretty good.

I wanted to sample the local fare, and there were so many options. Following a little back-and-forth with the bartender, I settled on a shrimp po boy, with fries. The shrimp was so good, but the toasted roll was a little too crusty.

I wish, in retrospect, that I would have tried something else. I wasn't completely satisfied with my decision."
#NAME?,,"Food was only ok, not worth standing in that ridiculously long line for. Charbroiled oysters were over cooked. There was no mayo or spread on the po' boy which made it taste dry and bread wasn't fresh. Don't waste your time! ... instead cross the street to the much shorter line at Felix's. Much better food and tastier oysters!",
#NAME?,,,"Best grilled oysters ever! Oceana's Famous Oysters are soo good I came back for more. Service is warm, friendly and knowledgeable."
#NAME?,,Don't let the line outside or the popular name fool you... this is a French Quarter touristy spot. The staff is friendly and the food is fine. But waiting in line for oysters here isn't how I would chose to spend my time or money.,
#NAME?,"In my opinion, the best hot chicken place in town.  Food was delicious and there are enough choices to satisfy everyone.  The wait is a bit ridiculous, but if you know this going in it is not that big of a deal.  Will definitely be back again.",,
#NAME?,,,"This is a fine place to get some seafood in New Orleans. It's a big place and there is a lot of noise. It feels more like a sports bar/restaurant. The place was busy when we arrived and there was a steady flow of customers, which might be because it is in the heart of the French Quarter. 

Portions are very big and can be easily shared. The ambience is sneakers and shorts and tables and chairs are very basic. Service is quick and efficient. The food was a-ok, not thing special. There are lots of friend fish options with french fries, simple salads and local foods. For just a little extra in money you can most likely get a more authetic meal in a more quiet restaurant."
#NAME?,"I had to come to Hattie B's while in Nashville!! Idk if there's anything I came say in my review that you don't already know. Chicken: incredible, salty and hot. Grits: delicious and with bacon!! Mac N Cheese: YUM I LOVED. Worth the wait for sure and the food comes out quick.",,
#NAME?,"Well I waited in the line for 45 minutes with really high expectations, especially after eating at Gus' in Memphis, but it just wasn't great.  Lots of fried, oily batter.  It was piping hot, not dry, and the service was great...just wasn't great in my opinion. The apple cobbler with ice cream was good.",,
#NAME?,,,"I am a server, so normally I'm very critical from that standpoint, however this restaurant provided excellent service with a very friendly staff. Food and drinks were received exceptionally quick, and everything tasted great. Eat here for a good taste of New Orleans seafood!"
#NAME?,"I have been meaning to try Hattie B's for the longest time. It all comes down to the food - which is delicious.

However, each time I tried to go in, the line was out the door and I never got a chance to go in. Until recently. I caught it at the right time. 

Pros: 
The food! its truly awesome. I got the boned chicken second highest hot level. It was delicious. 
Common seating: you get to sit and chat with complete strangers. It gives a sense of community. Tourists very inquisitive. And Talkative. 

Cons:
The wait time. Its straight ridiculous. 
The seating: not adequate enough to accommodate. I had to stand with my drink and ticket waiting for a seat - for the two douchebag business men bullshitting and lolly gagging with finished meals and empty trays. Um, douche nozzles, I paid for my meal, There's no open seats. I am standing here like an idiot, while you chat about whatever. Go chat in the conference room. inconsiderate cock-weasels.",,
#NAME?,"Most amazing chicken 'n waffles brunch only offered on Sundays!  I got there 25 minutes before the location opened, approximately 20 people on line before me and it was 1hr 10 minutes of waiting which was absolutely worth it!!! Loved it!!",,
#NAME?,,"Came here with my cousin as we were wrapping up our cross-country road trip. They have some amazing oysters! Price is a little high, but then again, it's New Orleans. This restaurant was very close to our hotel and is around the corner from Bourbon Street. Great place and would recommend it.",
#NAME?,,This is a fun atmosphere and a good time.  The food is good but not great.  Would recommend on service and atmosphere alone.,"Mixed emotions here...I have eaten here twice, one time I got food poisoning and the other time it was great food.  I would give it a chance again based on the food quality the great time."
#NAME?,"BEST FRIED CHICKEN. EVER. PERIOD. END OF DISCUSSION!!

Came in after 9pm on a Wednesday night and there was only a few people in line ahead of us. I ordered the small chicken plate with mac and cheese and potato salad as my sides. The potato salad was nothing to write home about, but the mac and cheese was yummy. All I cared about was how amazing the chicken was. I got medium, and it was the perfect kick for me.

Also... get the banana pudding. You won't regret it!",,
#NAME?,"Fried chicken dipped in hot mixture .... it was pretty good but not quite whaT I was expecting. 

I had eaten here before and not knowing it was known for hot chicken, I ordered something else aNd thought it was average.

Stood in long line in drizzling rain. Line was slow ..... chicken was pretty good but not great. I'll try again but will experiment with other hot chicken places to see which I like best.",,
#NAME?,,,"Wow. Just wow. This was my favorite meal while vacationing here. The server was super friendly. I got the taste of New Orleans and got to try all the things. Included was the beans and rice, jambalaya, and étouffée. Wow each of them were cooked to perfection. The crawfish etouffee was something else, man. So delicious. Wowowowowow."
#NAME?,,,As a local this place is very overrated. I've Tried it at least 4 times on the advice of tourists and they've failed miserably.  The oysters were tasty like other spots the seafood wasn't fresh tasting.  Honestly this spot is s TOURIST TRAP and I doubt locals go here.  If your a visitor try the website where Nola eats for much better restaurants in the city
#NAME?,Impressive!!!!! Long line but moves decently. Be prepared to wait. This mild is spicy enough to be just right. The chicken is superb!!! I'll be heading back to visit soon. Two hour drive and a two hour wait but well worth it! I only gave a 4 star because of the long lines. Food deserves a 5 star rating.,,
-ToTuVuTRc4zggXaQ-1kog,,,First time in NOLA first time at Oceana I must say the people in Nola are warm and friendly we decided to eat here at the bar and the bartender Brandi is great.  I had the Cajun creole ettouffee and hubby had the shrimp poboy.  It was delish!  Two thumbs up!
#NAME?,,,First night in NOLA has started perfect AND Everything here was awesome. Service by Karaline was great she was knowledgable and very polite. Other yelp reviews are on point the food here is EXCELLENT. If you want to have some good food in NOLA def come here ! I Had the red fish and it was amazing ! Pô boys were also really good!
#NAME?,,,First time here and everything was amazing! There's a line out the door but luckily we got in after about 5 minutes. I started with the oyster Rockefeller and it was AMAZING...!! I died and came back to life. As my entree I went for the taste of new Orleans... It was so filling and there were good amount of chunky crawfish in there I was in etoufee heaven! I'd highly recommend this place to whomever is visiting NOLA for the first time!
#NAME?,"Sooo good, but way too much food. Had the hot wings with pimento Mac and cheese, collard greens and banana pudding. It's worth the long wait in line.",,
#NAME?,"It was ok for me. Being from N.O. I think that I'm just used to a different frying method. Meat was tender and juicy but I prefer a crispy southern  batter. The medium spice was perfect for me, I'd say for comparison purposes, medium=Popeye's spicy. It was perfect. I wouldn't like it any hotter.  I liked the beans and the mac and cheese the best. Fries looked great but I  had to make choices!  Loved the ambiance. The line moves very quick. I ordered take out twice since i was working near there and it was very convenient. I did prefer the tenders to the chicken on the bone. Very good.",,
#NAME?,,,Food was delicious....However the service was seriously lacking from the time we arrived to when we left. Drinks took over 15 minutes to arrive after placing our order and we never saw much of our waitress after ordering food. With how expensive the food is you would think the service would reflect those prices as well.
#NAME?,,Very very awful place! Rude reception lady. Horrible service. Awful food-got a running stomach right afterwards!!! Biggest tourist trap ever! Desire oyster bar has much much better chargrilled oysters maybe on the smaller side. Daisy duke has much better etouffe.,
#NAME?,,"Don't let the line out the door scare you away from this place. This was our first stop after checking in our hotel in NOLA. The wait wasn't too long for a party of two, as we were seated at the bar within minutes (there was about 12 folks ahead of us, all larger parties). We sat with Mr. Hollywood, and he was cool cat. He kept the convo going and provided some tips on which stops to hit and where to be a little more vigilant with our surroundings, seeing as we were tourists and all . Nothing wrong with being a tourist - we help the economy, expand our love of culture for that area and as long you're not obnoxious, then we good (don't be that a-hole tourist, anywhere!).  Super friendly service from him and the gals behind the bar. Loved it. Talk about Southern hospitality. 

Now on to the stuff we came for: OYSTERS. Let me say WOW. They were a good size that was not overwhelming with right amount of flavor.  Slurped them right up and ""Hollywood if He could"" kept shucking for us. We also had half a dozen of charred oysters. AMAZING and dripping with buttah and melt in your mouth stuff. Just writing this review is making my mouth water. It's THAT good. And the crawdads? Oh my oh my.....such flavor!! AND they were not the puny itsy bitsy little spider ones. No, no.  They were big enough to enjoy. A pound went too easily between us, so we ordered another. I can easily eat cinco pounds in a sitting, however, we wanted to save our tummies and walk and try other places. It was muy bien. 
Just for comparison, on our last day, we hit the place across the street from Acme and we can say the service and food was night and day. Acme knows what they are doing, food taste wise and service. If you sit at the bar, try to sit with Hollywood. I call him ""Hollywood if he could,"" but he wouldn't, cause he's been shucking for 34 años. Me encanta charler con Señor Hollywood!
 Oh, and I didn't have to show any boobies - got my first beads from Hollywood himself. Such a sweetheart! Try Acme then hit up Cafe Du Mondé.",
#NAME?,"not a fan of their pimento beans, but the chicken was nice and crispy. Prices were good. They are known for spiciness, but I can't handle spicy. I was surprised they actually has the option of not-spicy at all. definitely choose the mac and cheese side over beans.
iced tea was good. free refills :)
I ordered my dessert together (long lines!) with my meal and they waited for us to be done with the main course before they brought out the dessert. that was very considerate of them :)",,
#NAME?,,,"Best gumbo, best jambalaya, best red beans and rice, best fried shrimp, best hush puppies.  Portion sizes are large but the food is so delicious you won't have leftovers.  Restaurant is larger than it looks. Very quaint relaxed atmosphere.  We couldn't hear all the noise outside.  First time here on vacation. Local recommended the place.   Worth it!!"
#NAME?,"After trying different BBQ restaurants in town, the local Lyft driver told us that BBQ is not what Nashville is known for.  It's the Hot chicken!  And he told us to try Hattie B's the only place in town that made hot chicken famous.  We want to get the taste of it before leaving town.  From the outside looks is not that impressive but the line to order the food is always wrap around the block.  Don't let it intimidate you.  The line moves pretty quick.  We ordered medium spice level and it plenty spicy, given that I'm Thai and can handle spicy level well.  I love the juicy meaty chicken and the crunch is just incredible.  The side we got was Mac and cheese and southern green.  The both so tasty.  Quick service, and great food.  If you come to Nashville you gotta have some HATTIE B's!!!!!!!",,
#NAME?,,what Peter D. said.  plump oysters char-grilled or fresh shucked AND fried shrimp platter...awesomenimity.,
#NAME?,,,"I know this is weird, but I have to give a fairly positive review for what really should be pretty negative. The redemption came from how good the food was. I was staying in a hotel nearby and they offered delivery. I ordered a fried catfish platter - fish, fries, hush puppies, coleslaw. The whole enchilada, as they say. Well, what I got was the blackened catfish with jambalaya and veggies (greens, in this case). Not what I wanted, not what I ordered, not what I expected. But you know what? It's was pretty damn delicious. Probably much healthier for me, too. I was drunk ordering, after all."
#NAME?,,,"Smashingly good!  Had fresh oyster, seafood gumbo, crab cakes, barbecue shrimp !!!  Tiara's service was also very pleasant and cordial!!"
#NAME?,,,"Our first night in New Orleans and Oceana had a wonderful dinner for us. The food was extremely good, we split a few apps and were so full and surprised. A dozen raw oysters, half fried half blackened gator bites and a cup of their gumbo."
#NAME?,,"Long wait, but decent service once you get in.
1/2 dozen Chargril oysters and 1/2 dozen more traditional prep. The Chargril were interesting and worth the try, but I'd stick to the more traditional preparation next time.
Don't waste your time on the crab cake. It's mostly filling and not much crab.
The hushpuppies were amazing.",
#NAME?,,"Love this place! We were a party of 10 and we're accommodated quickly, the service was on point. I ordered the boom boom shrimp was was amazing. Th chargrilled oysters were so good we had to
Get another dozen. The crab cakes were good. And the crawfish hush puppies were my favorite!",
#NAME?,"I normally have a ""no waiting"" policy.  But this line went very quickly and I'm glad the line didn't deter me because the chicken was DELICIOUS.  I'm a wuss and the medium was perfect for me.  My husband loves spicy and enjoyed the Hot.  Would definitely go back.",,
#NAME?,,"Short & sweet:

Service: 4
Food: 4
Wait time: 4*
Price: 3
Cleanliness of bathroom: 3

I like seafood and I like shucked oysters. If I were not planning on buying a pair of Louboutins sometime in the (unfortunately, far-away) future, I would probably have eaten more. 

I don't know what I was thinking, but I grossly miscalculated how ""full"" I'd be after eating a plate of shucked oysters. I imagined myself to be somewhat full so I ordered a small cup of expensive gumbo. I finished my food and realized I was still starving, but had already spent a good amount of money. So then I ordered a muffuletta sandwich, which was too much food, and ate half of that.

What I would do next time: Order only fresh seafood (the gumbo isn't worth it). After all, it's what Acme is renown for. Both raw and chargrilled oysters are delicious. The chargrilled comes with some butter cheese sauce melted over it and is accompanied by some bread pieces. A little salty but oh-so-good. 

Keep in mind that Acme is one of the most famous restaurants in NoLa. We went on a very ordinary Tuesday night and waited 15 minutes, but I hear the wait can be incredible. It's first come first serve so be prepared to wait on a weekend night. 

Also, it's a little pricier since it's seafood and since it's so famous. 

But the oysters...YUM!",
#NAME?,,"It doesn't get any better than Acme. Several years since I was here last but still amazing. Sit at the bar and watch the counter person open oysters and then sample his great work. Our dozen raw oysters were huge, sweet and delicious. Our dozen grilled oysters were hot and topped with wonderful garlic butter. At our server's suggestion we added a few drops of smoked Tabasco. Fabulous!",
#NAME?,,"Wow! The reviews did not lie. The chargrilled oysters are amazing. We went in for a late lunch, found seats at the bar and were promptly greeted by a friendly bartender. The food was fresh, and great. Being from Florida, I'm used to fresh seafood and this place had it! The soft shell crab poboy was spot on! 

This is a must for any future visit!!!!",
#NAME?,,,"The wait was short,  staff super friendly. We had the alligator bites, both blackened and battered and they were delicious. Also, the Rockefeller Oysters, those were okay. The flavor was good but they weren't charboiled. They weren't crispy how I like. For our main dishes, we went with what the waiter recommended, the Jambalaya Pasta and Blackened Catfish with Shrimp and greens was amazing. Both dishes were full of flavor!"
-WDIlaWrHSD1Jb7a-2dw0A,,New Orleans cuisine that's really good for a chain restaurant. This is an easy go-to for dinner or watching a football game.,

I always get the sandwich with medium sauce.",,

I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant and was very pleasantly surprised. The food is flavorful, the waitstaff is pleasant, attentive, and prompt.. and the atmosphere is simple, but functional. 
Great for large, private, groups as well. You won't be disappointed."
#NAME?,,,"We've only come for breakfast, but it's a go-to place with solid food and great bloody Mary's. Breakfast may not be quite the same as Petunia's, but is a decent replacement."
#NAME?,,,"This place is SOLID and I'm a fan.

First of all, they had great crab cakes - New Orleans style. These were absolutely da'bomb. Maryland crab cakes and New Orleans crab cakes are two different things and I'm glad I have now had the best of both worlds. The atmosphere of the place was great as they had outdoor seating and a nice enclosed deck outside. The service was absolutely stellar and our waiter was very nice. The bread pudding was fantastic as well. I'm knocking a star off because it was a little pricey but I guess I should expect that with it being right off of bourbon street.

The Hurricanes were fantastic as well and I drank more than one. Great seafood place and I would return if I ever went back to New Orleans."
#NAME?,,,"I have a delivery order worth &138 and it was disappointing because the pasta was not packed properly, the sauce has spilled out of the container and there were 3 mssing items on the delivery.  So the delivery guy has to go back to pick it up again and it took another 2 hours wait.    I lost about $35 worth of food... I called to follow up on the food they are suppose to deliver but they place me on hold for about 10 min and it seems like no one will pick up my call... Unbelievable service... they charge so much on their food but they their service is very poor.  I Regret ordering from this place.  Very poor customer service...."
#NAME?,,,"First time in Nola and this restaurant was a great choice! Authentic eats with incredible service. Ask for Pamela, she suggests great dishes and drinks that you'll love!"
#NAME?,,"Love the fried crawfish tails!!! And the oysters. Can't go wrong with this old establishment. Don't expect luxury, it's a fried seafood joint. Good New Orleans cooking with a fun atmosphere. 

I always put the chipotle Tabasco hot sauce on my oysters. Best condiment for em and they always have bottles.",
#NAME?,"WORTH THE WAIT, we stopped in last week after landing in Nashville waiting for our Airbnb to be ready. The line took about 40 minutes, but the food was phenomenal. For those fearful of heat, they have ""southern"" options (basically just traditional fried chicken). Between the 4 of us, we each went for the chicken sandwich and it was delicious. Sides were also very good! Definitely a must try if you're in Nashville!",,
#NAME?,,,Great atmosphere. I had the French toast and it was delicious and very filling. My friends ate St. Louis eggs Benedict and they really enjoyed it. I would definitely come back again!
#NAME?,,Awesome NOLA atmosphere. The charcoal oyster were DELICIOUS. Some guy in line in front of us (yes sometimes there is a line but it goes fast) told us about the charcoal grilled oysters and I'm so glad he did. It was a little chilly as we were under the most powerful fan but still- delicious!!!,
#NAME?,"There was nothing special about the place. Sure, the chicken was good, but I've had better. The Mac and cheese wasn't that great either. I don't get why it's getting all these great reviews.",,

#NAME?,"Believe the hype, my friends!! We were looking for somewhere to watch the Miami Heat game and heat must've ignited our thoughts so we headed to Hattie Bs hot chicken. First time here and was super impressed. Place has a very casual hipster vibe and lucky for us their line wasn't very long this evening. Good thing they are open till midnight. I decided to bring on the heat and get the medium. It was just spicy enough before sending me overboard. The rest of my fam varied between southern, mild, and hot! That hot was clucking hot! Be ready. I think medium is the best of the hots but that's just me. They had Chicken Scratch on draft and the pimento Mac n cheese were bomb too. So much goodness and our Miami Heat won that night. Win win at Hattie Bs!",,
#NAME?,,"The étouffée is a seafood based gravy with a generous mix of unbattered shrimp and battered/fried crawfish tails served over white rice. Delicious and filling.

The fried catfish has a slightly salty batter with a nice crunch. This fish was cooked to an almost transparent, moist doneness.

Both dishes together ran us about $40. Not great value, but understandable considering the location. At around 9pm there was a bouncer at the door ushering arrivers into a long line that stretched to Bourbon Street. You can skip the insane line by ordering takeout.",
#NAME?,,,"This place is overrated.  The food is BLAH, the drinks are too damn expensive; the waiters are also sappy.  I think they count on getting over on tourists."
#NAME?,,,"The service here was great. My server knew the menu and had a pleasant attitude which was refreshing. I had the famous broiled oysters and they were probably the best oysters I've had. I definitely recommend them. The seafood gumbo is good. I also recommend the jambalaya seafood pasta, there is gator in it but if you're up for the experience, I say go for it! My husband ordered ""the taste of New Orleans"" platter, it was okay just not what was expected. 
Overall, I say if you're in New Orleans and around Bourbon street, you should make the stop even if it is just for the oysters."
#NAME?,,"Good food, but expensive, small portions.  

They don't split checks.

PROs:
Food is delicious
Right off Bourbon street (convenient location)
""Famous""

CONs:
Expensive for Small portions
Always a wait to get in (but not too long)
Expect to spend between 14 and 20 for your lunch.
They don't split checks.
It was credit card only the day I was here.

An $8 bowl of gumbo was a shallow snack.  Delicious but small.
Raw oysters were good but standard fare for any decent oyster place.",
#NAME?,"Hattie B's copied Prince.  Everybody knows that.  Quit pretending you invented hot chicken, Hattie.  It was here for decades at Joe's Chicken Shack and Prince's.  All it is is fried chicken with tabasco sprinkled on it!  Nothing special at all.",,
#NAME?,,"Always saw lines outside ACME, and we waited about 40 mins in line for dinner. But after the long waiting, good are good, especially the oysters, cooked in delicious sauce. The long waiting is worth, but on the other hand it left us higher expectation, and may feel not that ""satisfied"". But I will definitely recommend this restaurant!","Been their twice while in NO, the food is great and the staff are friendly and helpful. Taste of New Orleans is my favorite, combination of most famous dishes of NO. And try oyster, fresh oysters are the best I have in town."
#NAME?,,"Wish I was able to drive through NO all the time.  Jimmy, how about another dozen and a bloody mary! Great staff",
#NAME?,,,Redfin Lafourche was delicious and the crab cakes were amazing. Good food and fast service. Only downside is the grody Bourbon Street outside.
#NAME?,,,"some are pretty good
but the serving was not impressive
there was a bad smelling item and the server was not able to accept that thing"
#NAME?,,"Came here expecting it to be as amazing as everyone says it is. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It honestly was the worst meal I've had on my trip. 

Had the chargrilled oysters which were burnt and smothered in cheese. More cheese than oyster. Had better oysters down the street. Sorry. Raw oysters were small. Had a shrimp po' boy. Shrimp was cooked well and tasty but sandwich needed more sauce. Jambalaya was just average. Service was good.

To each his own. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan. I would rate it a 2.5 if I could.",
#NAME?,,"This place has HUGE amazingly fresh and delicious oysters with the BEST tangy/spicy cocktail sauce.  I was never a fan of oysters but this place had my craving them during my whole trip and back in SF.  We also had the grilled oysters which were so rich and flavorful--so full of butter!  I know they were probably heart attack central but who cares.  Anyway, the shrimp po boy wasn't that great for me.  Go with the oysters.  Amazing.  Just.  Amazing.",
#NAME?,,"Ok so I tasted the off-the-menu boom boom shrimp, the ""New Orleans Medley"" (red beans, jambalaya and seafood gumbo) and the fried crab claws (it's an injustice to fry crab like that). It was ok. I took a couple bites and came to Deanie's. The bartender Curtis was super cool. Next time I'll try the chargrilled oysters even though I've never had an oyster that I liked. I know...I know...that's what they're known for. My mistake. I just thought the other food would be good too.",
#NAME?,,,AMAZING! Food was fresh and the service was just as good. Not as flashy as some places in the French Quarter but the prices were sweet and the food was delicious.
#NAME?,"The chicken and all other food is very good. I hate giving only 4 stars, but the wait time and parking situation is ridiculous. I rarely go there because of this. Also, there are some very good competitors.",,
#NAME?,"Hattie B's was on the top of my list in regard to my ""Must Eat"" places in Nashville... and conveniently enough, the 19th street location was right around the corner from my hotel. Score. 

I walked to Hattie B's, not exactly knowing what I was getting into. For some reason I didn't plan for an excessive wait. That was a mistake. I waited for an hour. AN HOUR. I tried calling for carryout while in line, but no one answered. So I waited, and waited... made new friends, planned my order out and just tested my patience and want for hot chicken. 

By the time I arrived at the front of the line I was expecting the best hot chicken, ever. Wouldn't you? I ordered medium tenders, fries and banana pudding. I also ordered a carry out order to take home, including hot tenders, pimento mac n cheese and greens. That order was making its way to the fiance, hoping it would hold over ;) So the wait for food was exceptionally short compared to the wait in line. Like, maybe 5 minutes. I ended up sitting with my new friends, which was nice... the social part of the this became an experience in itself, probably bigger than the food part. 

So my food came. It looked good, and smelled good and felt familiar to the hot chicken I eat in Louisville. I'm about to be ""that guy"" though, so hold on to your britches. I ordered medium heat, because I heard the hot and clucking hot were really hot.. so at home medium is the way to go, so I followed lead. That was mistake. There was hardly any flavor to the medium heat. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not ""hot chicken good."" I got a side of their hobo sauce, and it left me underwhelmed with the amount of non-flavor it had.. I wasn't impressed. 

The fries were seasoned pretty well, but nothing special. I LOVE fries, and these weren't the best fries I have ever had. Later I would try the pimento mac-n-cheese and that was delish. I have to say, my favorite part of the meal was the banana pudding and free refills.. oh god, that's harsh. But its real. I waited an hour for not so hot chicken, and sides that were just OK. I would go back if I didn't have to wait, but apparently waiting is a thing here... and that just isn't OK.. it's not Disneyland. I am proud of myself for waiting, and I am glad I tried it, because I love hot chicken, and I wanted the Nashville experience, but honestly... Louisville is doing hot chicken, and they're doing it better. Ouch.. Nashville, don't hate me. 

** This would be a 2.5 star rating if I could. The line kills it.",,
#NAME?,"This place was my husband and I's first stop in Nashville. It was about 9pm and there was still a line out the door! We initially tried to place an order online that ended up charging us multiple times without placing an order. We called the restaurant and they were able to take our order over the phone and pay when we went in to pick up. They told us 20ish minutes originally but we received a text that our food was ready almost immediately! Besides the online system experience, everyone we talked to was great and helpful. 

The food was delicious! We got the hot spice level and we kind of wished we got it hotter just 1 more level. The flavor was great, the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The was a great start to our Nashville trip.",,
-c4RN6M3Jn7iXLURP2rNpg,"First let me say I am not a fried chicken fan.  As we approached the restaurant had a line down the street. Hearing that this was a  must stop place we  got in line.  An hour later we where inside.  Waiting in line wasn't so bad as lots of people watching. I order the Damn Hot chicken.  You have a choice of original, mild, hot or damn hot.  I love the fire.  I was told my mouth would be on fire.  I'm used to hot spicy food and found the chicken to be quite tasty.
My mouth was not on fire but pleasantly pleased with the spicy flavor.  Then mac n cheese was on point too.  The hand squeeze lemonade was so good.  It was worth the long wait don't know if I would wait that long again.  We did go after the Vanderbilt football game ended so that added to the wait.",,
-c9G-JHNqrPY0_UU9j7BJA,,"I stopped in here last night and grubbed, and boy was it amazing. There was a 20 minute wait outside at 7PM; but I made sure to tell the door guy that I would sit at the bar, so I got in quickly.

First off - I think this place has the best bloody Mary's I have ever tasted. Seriously. Spicy, bloody, amazing. I had to have a second one.

Second, the char-grilled oysters were some of the most delicious things EVER! I polished off a nice dozen of these before moving on to a half dozen raw. 

The sauce for the raw oysters is delicious; the perfect blend of sweet and spice.

After consulting with the guy behind the bar, and my seatmate, I settled on the bread pudding for dessert. Delicious! Served with a nice bourbon and fruit sauce - the perfect end to an amazing meal.

If you happen to be in NOLA at any point, consider this a ""must do"" and enjoy the char-grilled oysters.",
#NAME?,"The line is always out the door. We waited around 40 mins to order. We are from out of town but everyone is friendly here. It was so refreshing. Also there is water outside for those waiting out in the sun.  I got the hot chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese. The chick was little dry for me taste. But the price is very affordable. Per person it came out to be around 10 dollars. The medium level for the spicy was good, there is a hint of spicy but you can actually enjoy the food. Good service about for me nothing too special stood out with the flavor.",,
#NAME?,,,We ordered online and the order came in fragile packaging where the food container is broken upon arrival.  The restaurant resent a fresh batch our order afterwards. However the initial order shrimp in the salad was missing.  Had to ask for a refund for the salad as three hours have already passed since our initial order going back and forth with the eat24 agent.
#NAME?,"I wouldn't ordinarily give a restaurant five stars when I waited over 1.5 hours to get in and order....however this place is outta control good!! Totally worth the wait. The fried chicken was excellent. However, be warned the spice is real. I normally like hot food and don't trust when restaurants call their food 'hot' because it's normally medium or even mild in spice. Got the chicken tenders with the 'damn hot' spice (second hottest). Ohmg wow was that a mistake. While it was realllyyy goood I had at least 40 oz water to unburn my mouth. Would recommend trying the hot if you like a kick but don't want your eyes to be watering from the heat. The superior side is the fries. Definitely enjoyed the macaroni and cheese but the fries were wayyyy better.","Tried both the raw oysters and the chargrilled oysters. Both were so tasty and delicious. If I had to absolutely choose between the two, go with the chargrilled. The sauce from the chargrilled oysters is mouth watering and you'll want to take the bread to try to soak up the juices with it (not kidding). We also got the seafood gumbo and the chicken gumbo. The gumbo was good, not the absolute out of this world gumbo I was hoping for but it was tasty and I enjoyed it.",
#NAME?,"My Uber driver recommended this place. When I saw the Yelp reviews, I decided to go eat there. I waited in sweltering heat for over 30 minutes to order but it was well worth it. The chicken was very tasty and juicy. I ordered a medium because I was told that hot was too hot but I would rate the medium at a 3/10 hot. Must be the Mexican blood. The sweet tea and fries were also great. I would definitely come back!",,
#NAME?,"Best chicken, bad service!
- Overview: I came around 8-9pm on Friday to skip the dinner peak time. The wait was around 15 minutes. Parking is very limited. You can order takeout to avoid waiting.
- The food: best hot fried chicken I've ever had. Not sure if it's the combination of hunger, the cold, and the excitement, but it was delicious. They were lots of tourists there when I came. They all talked among each other to see what to get. We got the hot chicken and a side of clucking hot sauce ($0.50). Even though my stomach did not greatly love me the next day, it was still so so good.
- Service: We chatted with some guys in front of us in line who was visiting from Canada. The cashier gave him the wrong change. Luckily, he found out soon enough and the cashier was like, oh ok oopsie. Then we waited for our food and they forgot our side sauce and beer (he said he had accidentally given our beer to someone else instead). Ok I'm not expecting a full restaurant service experience, but these guys don't seem to care at all.
Would I be back? Yes, definitely. Love the chicken. I'd probably do takeout next time!",,
#NAME?,,Three and a half stars really. As another reviewer stated the oysters weren't great - no flavor. Maybe they were off because I came when they opened the flood gates and killed local oysters. The BBQ oysters were fantastic though - buttery garlicky goodness. Other fare average for NOLA which is to say very good.,
#NAME?,,"Acme Oyster House is definitely a favorite when we come down to NOLA. The line is always down the block but don't be intimidated you rarely wait over 30 minutes. This time we were sat at a communal table with our high chair. The hostess stored our stroller for us during the meal so we could have some room. I got a wonderful fried seafood platter with fries. Everything was nice and crispy served with your choice of tartar or cocktail sauce. My husband got a big bowl of gumbo which he loved and also tried some fried seafood. Our daughter enjoyed sharing our meal as well especially the hush puppies. The bill was taken care of promptly and we left uncomfortably full. Happy with our experience as always, see ya next time we're in NOLA!",Oceana Grill is a great casual seafood option in New Orleans. There is always a line out the door but it generally moves fast as they have several floors of dining. We went early with our toddler and only waited 5 minutes to be seated. We were led to the top floor which was nice and open where we wouldn't be disturbing the people next to us. We ordered a couple of drinks and mine came out quickly but my husband had a long wait for his gin and tonic because she told us there was something wrong with the tonic. My husband ordered the gumbo and crab cakes while I got the mixed seafood platter and added crawfish tails. The fold was really good (who doesn't love fried seafood) and my daughter ate some of the hush puppies and crawfish tails. Even better Yelp offered a 10% off check in coupon which was just icing on the cake!
#NAME?,,,"The food is great, a little over priced but great. Our server wasn't the best but all the other waiters and staff were friendly. The gator bites were fantastic, especially with the remaloude sauce. You can't beat the po boys. We had the pecan pie for desert and it was one of the best pies I've ever tasted. I would definetly come back again."
#NAME?,,,"Arrived for a late night dinner on a Monday evening and they are open till 1am  Our waitress today is the lovely Kearica  We ordered red wine Robert Mondovi and LaCrema by the glass but bottles are available as well  So far so good  Then Oyster Rockefeller and Oceana's Famous Oyster    Deliciousness 
Then for dinner Redfish Oceana and Praline Duck   I think I enjoyed the Praline Duck more and I am not a duck fan but this was surprisingly really good   For dessert Chocolate Kahlua Mousse. Wow now that was tasty creamy smooth fluffy and not overly sweet which I appreciate. I want to enjoy the chocolate not the sugar 
I was impressed that all the servings came out rather quickly. And I enjoyed eating my fish hot not room temperature. This was probably the most pleasant surprise for me that my fish was brought to the table hot 
Thank you for an enjoyable evening after a long day of work"
#NAME?,,"Charred oysters are the best here, I haven't been able to find the size and quality anywhere else. I catch myself thinking about flying to NOLA from Denver, just to eat these. The Rockefeller oyster soup is also very good. Everyone loves the hush puppies. These 3 items make the perfect meal for me.",
#NAME?,Worth the stop. Definitely lives up to the hype. The staff is also very friendly which is a bonus.,,
#NAME?,"Hattie B's is always delicious. The chicken is hands down the best fried chicken I've ever had. Always super tender, juicy, and flavorful. I can handle a moderate amount of spice and tend to stick to level Medium. If you cannot handle SUPER spicy, I would definitely not recommend going higher. The fries are nothing to write home about, my favorite sides are always the Slaw, pimento mac and cheese and extra pickles of course! 

TIP- although worth the line, sometimes it is ridiculous. We always order online and it's always ready right when they say it will be. You walk right past everyone and get your food immediately! 

Definite must try for people visiting as well as locals!",,
#NAME?,,Chargrilled oysters were beyond amazing. The seafood gumbo is damn good also. Actually I didn't have anything off the menu that was bad. I liked it so much we ate their twice on our trip!,
#NAME?,"For a Friday night I was anticipating a really really long line for 7pm. So we ordered togo plates online to take to our hotel room. To our surprise the line wasn't long at all. 2 regrets...not ordering enough chicken (because this chicken was the most juiciest I've ever had) and ordering SHUT THE CLUCK UP lol. My husband and I really enjoy spicy food. We always order the spiciest pad thai, the spiciest wings, we put habanero hot sauce on everything, you get what I'm trying to say. I should have known when I opened the box and our chicken was literally black. Lol. Don't order shut the cluck up and think you'll be okay to party after either. We still felt sick the next morning. I am glad we were in our room because the scene we would have made at the restaurant would have been embarrassing . I did enjoy the heat, sure took us to some places. The parts of the chicken I could taste without the black spice on was freaking delicious. The cooling effect from the coleslaw, mac n cheese, and southern greens was highly appreciated and definitely recommended. My favorite part of my hot chicken plate was the bread. Toasty and soaked just enough of that spice. We made some Arnold Palmers with their fresh squeezed lemonade and sweet tea. Wish Hattie's was everywhere, we sure will miss this place.",,
#NAME?,Great chicken even if you don't like spicy! Be prepared to wait though it's worth it!,,
#NAME?,,"Stopped in while on a food tour of NoLa. Fantastic chargrilled Oysters with bread to soak up some of the sauce. Got a mixed poboy also. Great crunch on the seafood, nice bread, good sauce. Wanted more oysters but decided to save room for the rest of the day eating.",
#NAME?,"I have been wanting to come here for about 2 years now. I finally got a chance the other day to come here. It's practically down town Nashville. 

Menu items ordered:  I got their fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, and baked beans. I enjoyed my chicken. I mean it was great. But, it was not the best chicken I ever had. The best chicken I have had, still goes to (Chattanooga's) Champys Fried Chicken. Champy's is down town Chattanooga just Hattie Bs is down town Nashville. Now to put this into perspective:  This is my taste of the two chicken restaurants and my personal opinion. 

On Scene:  I had to pay $8 for parking behind the restaurant because there is a parking problem here. Also, there was an annoying long line just as I turned the corner while walking up to stand in line. I was in this line for 1 Hour. Plus it took another 15 minutes to receive my order after ordering. Also, my chicken dinner was about $18. So, if you include parking, the total costs was about $25.",,
#NAME?,,"My first review on Yelp.
The ""supposedly famous"" chargrilled oysters are so small and over cooked it's embarrassing.
The jambalaya is dried and without any meat in it ... For $12??!!!
This popular restaurant is a big disappointment.",
#NAME?,Yummy chicken and great staff. I order online all the time to avoid the lines and my food is always hot and ready for me when I arrive.,,
#NAME?,,,I love Oceana Grill! They have some of the best fried oysters in the city! The food is always good and consistent. Anyone visiting looking for good New Orleans cuisine should try this place at least once.
#NAME?,,,We were looking for a place nearby and oceana was recommended by a local.  The seafood jambalaya Fettuccini was delicious.  My husband had the catfish platter and there was enough for at least 2 people.  He said it was at last a 4.5.  The service was great as well.  The was a line out front but the wait was short.  If we get a chance we will be back before we leave NO.
#NAME?,,The food was fantastic but the service was a little lacking. We didn't get our drinks until food had already arrived the to the table. All in all it was a great meal. Those boo fries are something else!!,
-foIP_JKiHcomkmI_M-8GA,,"Busy, busy, busy! They herd people thru like live stock. We were on a mission for martinis and oysters so we were happy to oblige with the system. Everything came out quickly, efficiently, and we spent no more than 45 minutes slurping down spirits and seafood. I loved that the oysters were ice cold. It makes all the difference. The charbroiled were buttery and garlicy and were perfectly done. The crab cake was a bummer as it wasn't lumpy like I prefer. The crab was shredded ultra fine and it sat over what seemed like a scoop of creamed corn directly from the can. The french fries were ridiculously stupid as it seemed like they plopped a handful of the left over bits and nubs from the bottom of the fryer basket. The martinis filled only 60% the glass which seemed stingy but they weren't very expensive so I can let that fly. We were here for oysters and they nailed that part of the program.",
#NAME?,,"After being inspired by the Man vs. Food challenge here, my friend and I decided to be brave and try oysters for the first time here.  We were immediately greeted by THE nicest hostess.  Both of us got a half dozen oysters, and the sauce they gave with the oysters made it an EXCELLENT experience.  We both got po boys for lunch, with a side of french fries, and two sweet tea vodka and lemonades.  Just to top it off, we got the pecan dessert, which was absolutely heavenly.  All in all, it was a good place to eat, but with all of the friendly service we got there, I'll throw in an additional star!",
#NAME?,,,It was an amazing experience eating food here. The customer service was beyond expectation. We orders oysters we ordered fries and they were so so good. It is a must go please when you're in New Orleans
#NAME?,,"Food: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Cleanliness: 3/5
Decor & Style: 3/5

Did not live up to the hype from yelp =( everything was good but just par. If this place wasn't popular on yelp, you could never tell if it was good or not. Lots of other places to try in the FQ!",
#NAME?,,"Definitely deserved to come out on Travel Channel! If you do go here you will most likely see a line out the door, but not to worry, it moves pretty fast. You also do get served fast once you order. 

We ordered both raw oysters and char-grilled oysters. The char-grilled oysters are amazing. The sauce they use is the best, its almost like a cheesy buttery sauce, served with bread so you can scoop up that sauce even after you've eaten the oysters. I've never tasted fresher oysters than in this place. 

I came to this place twice during my New Orleans stay, the only thing i wasn't too fond of was the second time i went, we again ordered raw and char-grilled oysters, but this time they felt dirty. As in you could feel little pieces of the oyster shell in the oyster when  you would bite down, so just wished they cleaned their oysters a little better.",
#NAME?,"Great food, some of the best chicken I've had, only reason for 4 stars is wait and space to eat.",,
#NAME?,"It was a long line waiting to get in, but soooo worth it! The chicken was amazing! I took my family and they loved it! I'd wait in the line any day to get some more! Great customer service as well!",,
#NAME?,,Loved their oysters - both grilled and raw... the grilled is so good. We had to order two dozen!!! That's 12 oysters each! This shows how much we love their oyster!,
#NAME?,"There's always an insane line here and honestly, the chicken isn't worth it. The spice levels are incredible inconsistent depending on the day. Additionally, I find the chicken to be more greasy here than other Hot Chicken places in Nashville. The pimento mac n cheese is either loved or hated. I prefer a more traditional mac n cheese.

All that being said, if I were comparing this to hot chicken places outside of Nashville, it would be ranked higher... there's just too many better options close by.",,
#NAME?,,"The constantly long line in front of Acme led me to think that this would be THE most amazing place for oysters. If it's a weekday and you line up right at 11 before the lunch rush or even a little earlier, you can significantly cut down your wait time. This is what we did.

The restaurant:
It was a little dark. Could have used more lighting.

The food:
Boo fries - these are regular fries trying to be special. Fries that probably were frozen in a bag before they were cooked and slathered with gravy on top. BOOM. 5 bucks. Don't get it.
Chargrilled oysters - were pretty good, but having just had fresh delicious oysters from Royal House the night before and just personally preferring fresh oysters, I thought it didn't meet the expectations I had after reading/hearing everyone rave about it. They're tasty enough, grilled with lemon and butter on top. It's a different way to eat oysters, I suppose. I still prefer the raw juiciness of uncooked oysters with tabasco sauce ;)
Rice and beans - I had to try one of the Southern staples while I was in NoLa and I decided to try it here, unfortunately. Are southern style rice and beans supposed to lack flavor? Some salt might have helped. The beans and rice were utterly flavorless. Only the sausage saved it. I love me my carbs, but this was not a very tasty way to eat them.
There's a medley option on the menu that has gumbo, jambalaya, beans and rice, etc sampler. I would try that because the gumbo and jambalaya are pretty good. The oyster rockefeller soup was also yummy, creamy and smooth in taste and plentiful with the oysters.

I guess overall this place gets 3.5 stars from me. I didn't get to try their raw oysters, but can it vary that much from place to place? Royal House was delish when it came to that.",
#NAME?,,,"the staff is very kind in helping us surprise our friend for her birthday! The atmosphere screams new orleans culture in the best way( coming from a local )The only thing I have to complain is that their alfredo chicken fettuccini is just a tad bit too salty for my taste but it was still pretty good !! Their bread pudding is absolutely to die for, melts in my mouth and it goes so well with the whip cream that comes with it!!"
#NAME?,,"The best fresh raw oysters I've ever put in my mouth. Not fishy at all, and as tasty as they come. If you are a raw oyster lover, this is the stop for you.

The charbroiled oysters were just ok, but paled in comparison to the ones at Drago's. The roast beef po' boy was a stand out item. Highly comparable to the debris sandwich from Mothers, only better. This is the stuff roast beef dreams are made of. 

The seafood etoufee was just ok. A bit bland and could have used more spice.

I will definitely be back for more raw oysters!",
#NAME?,,,The best crepe I have ever had! I had the St.  James crepe served by the best server Deannne; she recommended I get the crawfish mushroom sauce with the Crepe; making a great dish amazing. Nicest staff we have encountered on our trip. I had a bite of the crawfish omlette With crawfish etouffe that was also very tasty.
#NAME?,"OK. I am a tourist and will be writing a lot of Nashville tourist reviews. When we drove into Nashville after spending a good 9 hours in the car I needed food. And I mean it as if I did not eat soon I would probably collapse into a fit, much like a preschooler. I, being the avid Yelper, did what I do best and started searching ""FOOD"" in the area. Hattie B's came up because, honestly it has so many reviews. 2863 reviews as I am writing this. If it can have that many reviews and have a 4.5 star rating, it is at least worth it to try. I will say that the food was good. had a great time and the experience was fun. But...it was a wait of 45 minutes and I believe everyone in line was told to come here or also looked it up saying it was the spot to go. I do not think that this is a go to for locals, and that says something to me. But nevertheless it was awesome food. For $9.00 you got two sides and a meat. I have to say that is pretty great in my book. 

Main Dish:
Tenders. These were just three fried tenders of a good size with some mild seasoning on them. Since it was my first experience with hot chicken I did not know what to expect. I went on the side of caution and just got one bump up from no seasoning. I wish I would have been more adventurous because the mild was just meh, not hot or spicy at all, mostly just cayenne. The portions were enough to feed myself and to keep one tender for later. I thought that the tenders were really done well, and my only complaint was that they had a bit more grease on them then I would normally like. It seemed like the tenders didn't get to sit very long to have the grease drip off. BUT with how busy it was they probably just dash and go. And really it wasn't that huge of an issue. 

Sides:
I did not order all of these sides but between the person I was with and myself we I got to try all of these sides. 

Pimento Mac and Cheese. Really creamy and delicious. I loved that it had a bit of a unique taste because of the pimentos. I never had pimento mac and cheese and this was really something fun to try. It was also a bit spicier than I thought, bonus! I would get this again. 

Coleslaw. Would not get this again at all. Did not like the flavor. Did not like the consistency. Did not like it. 

Baked Beans. Spicy and good. Really a hearty dish. It was a little to hot for me to get this, it was not my choice. But the taste was good. 

Potato salad. Also not my choice but the taste was super fresh and the potatoes were a nice chunky size. YUM. I would get this again. 

Drink:
Lemonade. This was way too sweet for me and I cut it with water. Other than that it was said to be freshly squeezed and tasted amazing. 

I would say that they do online ordering or pick up. When we got there it was turned off because they couldn't keep up with all the orders and when we were already 20 minutes in line they turned it back on, but it would be longer to order online than to just stay in line. So maybe keep that in mind when you come back here. I would come back, just because the price and the taste of the food was good. But if any locals would point me into a direction that wouldn't have me waiting 45-1 hour in line, outside, in the hot south, I would probably head over there instead. 

The food was good, it was a fun experience, I would come again. Try it out and tell me what you think!",,
#NAME?,,,"The best Cajun food in New Orleans! Our server, Whitney, gave us the best service. Helped my friend with her order and customized it exactly the way she wanted it. She almost knew what we wanted. She was on top of the table and drinks we never had to try to get her attention for anything. 
All of the other servers and hosts were nice and polite. Great food, great service, and great environment. 10/10 would recommend."
#NAME?,,,"This was our last meal stop in NOLA, and we were both so satisfied! Our server gave us great recommendations, and we both got the pasta. The one pictured is the crawfish fettuccini...pretty spicy but full of flavor. We were here late on a Tuesday and got in quickly."
#NAME?,,"It's been a week since I ate there last, and I already miss it.  The jambalaya is incredible!  The crawfish and corn bisque was fantastic too.  Great food all around, very reasonable prices, and our waitress kept refilling our drinks before we could finish them.","Friendly service, but the food isn't quite what I expected based on the reviews I read.  The food wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great.  The turtle soup tasted like BBQ sauce and the jambalaya was sub-par.  I think thiswas the first time I've ever not eaten all my jambalaya."
#NAME?,"I'm an east sider but I'll still drive across town for Hattie B's. No, it's not an original hot chicken provider... but what they do, they do well. Think of it as the Starbucks of Nashville hot chicken. Plus... the sides are bomb.",,
#NAME?,I have heard about this place on TV. We were driving through Nashville headed to Mississippi and decided to stop here on a whim. It was a very warm day in Nashville and even though there was an hour wait we decided to stick it out and hope that it went by fast. Overall it took about an hour and a half from start to when we got our food. And good thing we did wait because the fried chicken was delicious. Probably the best I've ever had  We split the mild half bird and got a side of baked beans and a side of pimento Mac and cheese. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the only downfall to Hattie's is that it is so crowded,,
#NAME?,,"Yes, the line is long.

Yes, it's hot outside in New Orleans.

Yes, Acme Oyster House is amazing.  Best fried seafood and char-grilled oysters on the planet.  Fried catfish is amazing and lightly breaded in what I believe is cornmeal.  Everything is just a little-bit spicy, which I love.  Drinks were great (drink the beers here, as the Hurricanes at Pat O'Brien's are a lot better).  Wait staff is in a hurry, but they always get the order right and make great suggestions (which is crucial if you're a Yankee like me who's uneducated in the ways of NOLA cuisine).  

This place is authentic down to it's foundation.  I love coming here whenever I'm lucky enough to get down to New Orleans.  Wait on line, don't complain.  If you feel like you're going to complain, grab a hand-grenade at Tropical Isle (make sure it's in a plastic container) and enjoy the day.",
#NAME?,"The wife and I stopped by Hattie Bs on our road trip during a stop in Nashville. Looking up options it seemed like the place to be based on reviews. When we showed up there was a line out the door which is always a positive sign! A true fried chicken joint. I love how they give you the option of ordering white meat vs dark meat. The spicy options added a depth to the fried chicken. Sides were pretty good- pimento Mac and cheese, fries, and beans, and cole slaw. An overwhelming amount of food. 
Our favorite was the banana pudding. Chunks of real bananas and vanilla cookie crumbs on top. Yum!",,
#NAME?,,,"This is just down the block from our hotel. Walked by at 5 pm and place was pretty empty but by 6:15 p m there was a line to get in. Earlier we had spoken to one of the waitstaff, Earl, who gave us a card to bypass the line. Yup! The card worked and we went pass the line of people there waiting and straight to a table.

 Ordered 1 1/2 dozen oysters on a half shell (hugh oysters and very fresh). Barbecue shrimp 8 large shimp/ prawns in a delicious barbecue sauce that was more sweet than tangy. Big bowl of gumbo with rice and French bread. The 2 hugh crab cakes were stuffed with crab and not much filler.  Dessert was a Kahlua chocolate mousse pie with vanilla ice cream.  Just the right amount of sweetness, perfect texture and a toffee surprise in the middle. 

Wait staff was thorough, friendly and efficient. Prices were affordable and the best in town for raw oysters - $12/dozen, $7/ half dozen."
#NAME?,,"We had just landed in New Orleans and after a long day of traveling, we were super hungry! We searched for a nearby place for some grub and found Acme Oyster House. The best part... it was just a block from our hotel! That plus all the great reviews convinced us to check it out.

We saw a LINE on a Wednesday night... another good sign! We were hungry but were only interested in the best eats while on vacay so we decided to wait. Although the line was long, the wait wasn't long at all. They're very efficient in seating everyone in a timely manner.

This restaurant was very interesting! It's a LOT bigger than it looks from the outside (another factor for quick seating). We ordered so much more than we should have, but no regrets! Everything was so delicious!

Must-trys include the Boom Boom Shrimp, Seafood Etouffle, and The Peacemaker Po-boys. Don't forget to get some oysters! They're fresh and HUGE! The charbroiled oysters were also super yummy... slathered with garlic and butter! It comes with some bread for you to soak up all that buttery goodness!

In fact, this place was so good that we came back a few days later for a quick late lunch! We were dreaming of that Boom Boom Shrimp ever since we had it!

It's loud and casual, service is quick and friendly. This place is a must for any NOLA visitors!",
#NAME?,,,Food was great!   Our server was beyond great.   When visiting ask for Michael.   He was very knowledgeable and prompt.   Every item he suggested was amazing.   Will visit again.
#NAME?,"I don't quite know why Hatties has 500x the reviews that Prince's, the original hot chicken spot, does, but all I can say is, my first hot chicken was worth the hype. I shared a small with my husband, which included 2 sides, and also added a wing, which turned out to be too much food since we had eaten all day - but is probably the right amount if this is a meal for you. I normally shy away from spicy, but the medium was just enough of a kick and was really the perfect level of spice to get the experience that is hot chicken. 

I cannot believe I missed out on this my first trip to Nashville. Never again!",,
#NAME?,,"Everything those people below me wrote is true.  

I found food in New Orleans a slight let down (more interesting for Americans, I might suggest), but Acme was truly a delight.",
#NAME?,"Oh. My. Goodness! This was our 1st trip to Nashville and everyone recommended Hattie B's. We were told get there early or prepare to wait in line. We got there about 5 minutes to open, about 6 people already in line and we were inside within minutes. Quick and friendly service! Amazing Hot Chicken! Medium was hot, Hot was hot, Damn Hot was KILLER! Highly recommend","My husband and I have never been the ones to venture out to eat oysters but we thought why not. Let me tell you, if you're in the French Quarter you NEED to stop here. The chargrilled oysters are AMAZING!!!! Honestly anything on the menu won't disappoint",
#NAME?,,"Char grilled oysters what more can I say... always a line and perfectly prepared. I'm sure there are other great oysters in town but this place is iconic and should be on your list to at least try once 
Tip- if u go over lunch very short wait",
#NAME?,,"This was exactly what I was looking for out of a New Orleans feast.

Great food, reasonable prices, incredibly fast service.

I'd return and bring my friends.",
#NAME?,,"The parboiled oysters were lit! And I'm not a huge oyster fan. The fried crawfish was good too. I hated the sauce it came with, but that was no big deal. I'd come back here.",
#NAME?,"Certainly a bit overrated (We waited an hour and a half out in the scorching sun), but it's pretty good. I would recommend the dark meat chicken because it's tastier, but the peach cobbler is a definite must try. It is so warm and delicious. If you don't mind the wait, you can try out the place just to cross it off your list.",,
#NAME?,"I recently tried HB on 8th for lunch with co-workers. I got a ""damn"" hot chic sand. It was large, juicy and damn hot. Quality sandwich for sure. Nice open floor space and staff is efficient and nice. The fries were your typical frozen fry. Upgrade to fresh fries and no one can touch ya!!",,
#NAME?,,"It's all hype. Some of the food is good but not worth the long lines.

Another tourist trap. This one is hugely popular. I'm only here to try the Fried Peace Maker Po Boy. Supposed to be one of the top 10 sandwiches in America..

The char grilled oysters was heavily seasoned. Personally, I prefer cold water oysters because they have a more intense flavor. Gulfs are bigger but tasteless; typical of warm water oysters.

The bread for the po boys were too chewy. It wasn't toasted.

Won't RTE.
.",
#NAME?,,,Whitney was amazing! We are visiting from out of town and she knew exactly what to  Recommended. Everything is absolutely fantastic! We will definitely be back.
#NAME?,,"A no-frills, authentic seafood place that you must try!  The charbroiled oysters were excellent -- I ordered a half-dozen and quickly wished I had ordered a dozen.  I had a cup of seafood gumbo that was fantastic.  I had the spicy sausage Po Boy (cup of gumbo and half sandwich), which was delicious.  The only drawback was that the delicious draft Abita Amber beer was served in a plastic cup.  Perhaps I could have asked for a mug, but I was having such a delicious meal that it did not occur to me to ask.  I would have gone back every day if I could have.  I went about 3 pm on a weekday and there was no line.",
#NAME?,,Acme get's 5 star because the food was good... Oyster are very good just too small.... The food... The gumbo very good.... A must try,The food was very good I enjoyed the oysters The best the seafood is very good the drinks are good I will go again
#NAME?,,"Great atmosphere and great food. We sat at the bar with ""Hollywood"" and loved every minute of it. We tried the raw oysters and the baked oysters; both were amazing. This was our favorite seafood spot in The French Quarter.",
#NAME?,,,"Oceana Grill was recommended by a co-worker. The food was very good and very reasonable!
 
We ordered Shrimp Po-Boys, which came with fries and coleslaw. We also ordered the Alligator Bites, which came fried or blackened, so we tried both.

Our waiter was the best! The food was delicious and well seasoned. The restaurtant was clean, well decorated and pretty quiet. I wanted dessert, but I couldn't eat another bite. Next time!"
#NAME?,"I love this place as an occasional treat. There's another place in town that's been around longer and probably invented Nashville hot chicken, but it's in a marginal neighborhood, grungy, and doesn't have beer. Hattie B's is lively, friendly, clean, and has a nice lineup of craft beers to go with the excellent chicken. 
 Although I have a pretty high tolerance for hot stuff, I'd recommend going for the mild to medium chicken here. When you can feel burning and tingling inside your ear canals, you're not tasting the chicken itself.",,
#NAME?,,"Oh wow! Everything I was hoping for and more! After reading yelp, watching feature on Food Network and Triple D's, this is my first stop as soon as I arrived in Nawlins.

Charbroiled oysters was delicious, satisfying and everything I dream of.

Hush puppies and sausage links were good, however hush puppies were a bit dry and sausage links were a bit salty for my taste. A bowl of steamed rice and some ketchup would have been perfect.

Seafood gumbo was good but not as good as Mother's Restaurant, Sorry!",
#NAME?,,The only thing decent here are the oysters... so if that's all you're going for have at it. But my boyfriend and I ordered draft beers and they served it in these tiny plastic cups. We also ordered the half po boys half sides and the boys were so distasteful. I had to drench my po in lemon and cocktail sauce just to eat it. The jambalaya was super dry and had no flavor as well as the bisque. Just not the best food for especially for the price.,
#NAME?,,,Came here based on Yelp reviews as well as the 10% off offered for checking in.  We ordered the Oceana Famous Oysters and they were phenomenal.  We had a half dozen and should've gotten a full dozen.  Crab cakes were large and sauce was great.  Shrimp Po Boy was loaded with large shrimp.  We will probably go back here before we leave NOLA.
#NAME?,"Pimento mac n cheese and the greens were amazing!  The chicken was tender, but definitely not 5 stars nor waiting in line for more than 20 minutes.  Actually no line when we got there on a Thursday night at 7pm and yet they ran out of white meat chicken.  Fifteen minutes after we placed our order we were informed they ran out of chicken and it would be another 20 minutes while they cooked more.  Yup, it's a chicken place that ran out of chicken.  When we got our meal, the hot chicken was hot and juicy, but flavor-wise it didn't blow any of us away.  All the hot sides were served to us cold (because they were apparently waiting for the chicken);  when we told them they sent us out fresh hot sides.  Not planning on returning, it just wasn't good enough for us to spend our money their again.",,
#NAME?,,"Just tried acme's charbroiled oysters after having drago's oysters last night. We were lucky to have practically no wait on a Sunday after the lunch rush at acme's. Hubby ordered half a dozen half raw oysters and we shared half a dozen charbroiled. We tend to favor west coast oysters more but hubby did enjoy the raw ones nonetheless. We both agreed the drago charbroiled oysters were far superior in the quality and size of the oysters, the seasoning of the garlic butter topping, and even the bread. The ambiance was also much nicer at drago's (we went to the one in the Hilton). 

Personally I was glad we got to try the acme oysters without a wait bc it's not worth a one hour for the oysters or the experience there.",
#NAME?,,"Great fresh oyster. We ate at the bar so it was kind of loud though. Spent around 30 minutes waiting outside the restaurant and they were a lot of people inside the restaurant. So if you are looking for quite nice place to dine in, it's probably not the best choice.:/",
#NAME?,,,"Went there on a date a few times but recent went during COVID. I made sure we made a reservation because there were so many people out of the restaurant or trying to get seated when it's limited space(social distancing rule), all staffing even cooks wore masks. So we were seated 6ft apart from everyone, our order was finally taken 45mins after we got there, food and drinks did take a minute to get to us. I do however remember telling my date(an out of towner) NOT to order the red beans, etouffee, or gumbo(they are all can based basic dishes that need some soul and flavor)Highly wouldn't recommend if it's your first time trying these dishes I'd pick another restaurant. The fish is good here, however very small portion size for price, I've been told previously that we could bring in our own fish to be prepared in advance(which is so cool!). So back to my date lol, I ordered the Mandarin Blush and my date had the Swamp tea(I preferred his lol), sadly our drinks didn't come with dry ice like my previous experiences. Ive always ordered the blackened chicken Alfredo pasta because it has more flavor to the chicken. This time my chicken was barely blackened and at first they got my order wrong but quickly corrected it and I didn't want to make a fuss so I just kept it. Overall I'll still continue visiting and enjoying their pasta, maybe next time I'll try their deserts!"
#NAME?,,,Spent 5 days in NOLA and this was my favorite meal. I had blackened chicken and jambalaya.  Hubs had redfish and he said it was awesome.  Definitely recommend eating here.
#NAME?,,"I'm not a raw oyster guy. So I love their charcoal grilled oyster. About thirty minute wait but worth it. A little bit too crowded, and a little bit disorganized, but it's a bar and I can't complain.",
#NAME?,,,"This place seems much smaller on the outside than it actually is! We walked by it the first time. There was a small line outside, but we were quickly ushered inside and waited maybe 15 minutes from there. We traveled up two sets of stairs on our way to be seated and were sat at a window seat. Great food, great atmosphere. I ordered the crawfish ettoufee, my husband the fried shrimp and both were generously sized and delicious!"
#NAME?,,"There are tourist traps and then there are tourist traps. This tourist trap happens to be one because it's in the FQ. However, the food is great. Fresh, well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The service is efficient, but grizzled from over-exposure to drunk tourists, I'm sure.
The boo fries (which I was against ordering) were amazing, the oysters are fresh, the beans and rice tasty, and the po boys delicious. Their fried seafood is not greasy and cooked tender. Expect to stand in line for up to 20 minutes before you get in. It's probably a nightmare to get in during normal lunch or dinner times... we were there at 2:30pm on a cold and rainy day and still had to wait.",
#NAME?,,,Very nice Catfish Po-Boy.. Service really good. Be ready to make a long line at peak hours ... So if you go like 15 minutes before you will be good.
#NAME?,,"Got introduced to grilled oysters at Acme Oyster House and now I can't get enough.  They are so good!  Be careful, I burnt my finger on one of the shells:(  The oysters were fresh, big, juicy, and of course butter and cheese make everything better.  The cheese was not over-powering which was great as the real treat should be the actual oyster. I tried other grilled oysters in NOLA and the only thing you tasted was the cheese.   

Where Acme didn't deliver was the service.  We had to flag down our waitress to order more food.  Same thing for the check.  And then to have her run the credit card.  Had great service everywhere else in NOLA!",
-r5aFUx-uKR-at1rLFuLrQ,Yes.  I had hot and it was great.   We drove by several times.  Every time there was a long line over an hour wait.  One time we were able to walk right in.  It's a great hot chicken place,,
#NAME?,,"We were in NOLA during Christmas season and tried to go to the original location but the line was at least an hour wait or longer... so we ran over to their location in Harrah's and guess what???? No wait.

Food was just as good and the seating was actually more comfortable. We will come to this one next time instead of hoping to get in to the other location after a long long wait.",
#NAME?,,"I came here a few years ago while on vacation and was super excited to get back. I'm not an oyster fan but this place always has plenty on the menu to make me happy.

The seating line always moves quickly and they accomodate large parties really well. Our server was great and my jambalaya was SUPERB!

If you have little ones in tow, they have a well-rounded menu of sides so you don't have to commit to a full meal for a toddler. Love it!",
#NAME?,"Hattie B's was amazing.  You wait in line and I understand why.  It was well worth the wait.  We had a lot of people with us and we all got a different heat level.  Everything was great!  I think I will remember it always as the best chicken ever and I'm from the south.  Also, with this many people, you would not expect the high level of customer service.  I taught customer service for many years and they were top notch!  Thank you.",,
#NAME?,,,I got in just before the dinner rush. Their fryer wasn't working so no oysters but the NO Cosmopolitan was very good. Very good wait staff and accommodating for food allergies.
#NAME?,,,"Food was delicious, service was fast and friendly. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
-svKBo1PajIKIYaSu_-82w,,try the charred oysters. They are the best fucking oysters I've ever had. They taste great with the Chipotle hot sauce.,
#NAME?,,"I was visiting New Orleans and stopped here on a Monday afternoon before my flight. I actually don't eat oysters much. I'm pretty sure that's the specialty here, but I went with the intention to eat lunch and ended up just ordering a few drinks and appetizers. Other than poboys and oysters, the majority of the menu was fried and I just wasn't in the mood for fried food. I tried the crabcake and meat pies. The crabcake was mediocre and way overpriced for 1 crabcake; however, those meat pies were so bomb. I would go back specifically for the meat pies. The drinks were ok too. I think I was turned off by all of those fruit flies or gnats, whatever they were...flying all around the bar. It speaks to the cleanliness of the bar and restaurant. If it weren't for those delicious meat pies, I probably wouldn't even think to go back because there wasn't anything else outstanding about the place.","I went again and ordered the crab cake entree. Crab cakes are so good here, but I think I might be nore impressed with the sides. The corn and the greens are sooooooo good. However, not a fan of the gumbo. It has a very distinct seafood flavor like it was made with a seafood stoxk and there were like pieces of shells or something in it like from crabs or shrimp peels...I don't know, but I still ate it all. I was very hungry, but I guess I am more critical of gumbo because I just thought my own is much better lol. I would stick with the crab cakes when I go back...or even a veggie plate...the corn, greens and garlic potatoes were A1!"
#NAME?,,"Seems like an institution.  Usually a line at the door waiting to get in for dinner and lunch.  Ambience of a local NOLA place with a long bar and wooden tables.  Oysters are shucked in front of the bar for you to see.  The char-grilled oysters were quite good.  So was the seafood gumbo.  And, the raw, iced oysters were quite tasty too.  Service was very good as well. Go early or later to avoid the lines.  Worth a visit.",
#NAME?,,This is the second time I've been here and again it was fantastic. The raw oysters are amazing! I had two trays just myself!,
#NAME?,,,"Went for a birthday celebration. Food was good, server was good but food came to the table far too slow and erratic. Ron our server wasn't the issue. He tried hard to keep us happy."
#NAME?,,,"I give the food a 5. I had crawfish fettuccini, mmmmm (i would have been happy with bread and the sauce, so delicious) and the bread pudding is great. Right balance of sweet and proper texture. It's pricey for the style of restaurant, but that is to be expected due to location. (it's rout off Bourbon)  Our server was good but the bar service was lousy. I never walk into a New Orleans restaurant expecting much in the way of service with a smile. Overall, a little touristy, but worthy of going because the food is good enough."
#NAME?,,,"Our Uber driver told us about this place. Tried the alligator bites...so good! All tried oysters, I'm not a fan but the folks I was with loved them. Service was fast and friendly!"
#NAME?,,"Located steps from Bourbon St , I sat at the Oyster bar for lunch. Not only was the charbroiled oysters the best I had on my week long trip, the shucker regaled us with stories of some of the rogues of New Orleans history. Overall, a great stop when in the Quarter.",
#NAME?,,,"We ate here about 4 times on our week long trip to New Orleans. We ate at the restaurant twice and got delivery twice. The food is reasonably priced for the area and consistently good. I loved the Jazzy Crabcake Platter, and the Redfish Oceana the most. They both come with a very unique mushroom/crawfish sauce that is lovely and not too salty. Highly recommended, good menu for multiple tastes."
#NAME?,"Had the small dark (hot) with baked beans, potato salad and a grapefruit beer. SO GOOD! I will be thinking about that hot chicken for a long time! The hot level was very comfortable spice, could have done the next level up though I'm a spice seeker so take my rec with a grain of salt! The guy at the front desk was so sweet and cheery and polite, and the food came quickly but was fresh! Big fan of Hattie B's, would highly recommend to all chicken fans!",,
#NAME?,"Great hot chicken and definitely the place you should share with out-ot-towners and visitors to experience their first hot chicken. A must of Nashville. 

Unfortunately, it isn't the best hot chicken place in Nashville and has become over commercialized. The line moves fast but this is the McDonald's of hot chicken. If you want a good burger, you don't go to McDonalds. Still an experience that everyone needs to try and they have great locations.",,
#NAME?,,"My wife and I were on vacation in New Orleans and we decided I must try some boiled crawfish and the normally long line for ACME was reasonable.
 
We waited about 10 minutes to be seated and I ordered the 1 pound order of crawfish and 6 chargrilled oysters.
 
They came out and the crawfish were tough to open up and eat and the meat in the tail was ridiculously small, but sucking out the juices were good. I can say I don't need to order them again, but I am glad I tried it.
 
The chargrilled oysters on the other hand were AMAZING! Super buttery and a melted film of what tasted like a fine parmesan cheese. Just the best! You must try these.
 
The table next to us was about 4 20 something year olds and they ordered the etoufee plate and scarfed it down in about 2 minutes, it was insane, but having etoufee early in the trip, I knew why it went so quickly.
 
Super great service, cool ambiance, and the food was definitely 5 star!",
#NAME?,"We knew it would be good when we had to stand in line for 10 minutes to get in the door (a line out the door is fairly normal here). It's an order at the counter, take a number type of place. We found seats on the porch (covered and heated with standing heaters in cold weather) and had our food in less than 5 minutes. I got the medium-heat tenders and my dad got the no-heat dark meat. I got the black-eyed pea salad as one of my sides, and it was the best version I've ever had. The chicken was hot and fresh, and the medium heat level on my tenders was definitely what I would consider medium. The food here is SO GOOD! I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong choosing anything on the menu.",,
#NAME?,,"This is a NOLA mainstay and if you haven't had their chargrilled oysters, you don't know what you are missing!  Well worth the 15 minute wait to get in at peak times, and even worth dealing with the street hustlers outside (beware the shoe schtick).  The oysters come on a grill fired platter with copious amounts of garlic, butter and parmesan., and topped with half a loaf of french bread to sop up the buttery goodness.  So good.",
#NAME?,,,"Went here today for New Year's Eve dinner. Unfortunately, within an hour of having the dinner, all members of our party got sick with a case of food poisoning. We had the Louisiana Crabmeat cakes, Seafood Gumbo, Cajun Jambalaya, Blackened Catfish Po-boy sanfwich6. Not only was it an utter waste of time and money, it also completely ruined our new years Eve since we all had to return home immediately.

I would absolutely avoid this place."
#NAME?,,The chargrilled oysters are fantastic.  Expect a line outside.  The Debris Po Boy was also amazing.  Service was friendly.,
#NAME?,This is the place I crave in cheat days! Hattie's is always consistent and great! Plus I really love this location!,,
#NAME?,,"Have to add to the gazillion yelp reviews... Acme lives up to the hype! Gotta come here for charbroiled oysters, something I never had before coming to New Orleans (and I LOVE oysters!) They're oozing with butter and cheese and it just melts in your mouth... so good we came back for dinner another night and ordered 3 dozen for the 3 of us. 

The fresh oysters were some of the best I've ever had - not too salty, nice big size, and paired perfectly with cocktail sauce and horseradish. YUM! 

We tried some other things on the menu, but really... just come for the oysters. Add Acme to your NOLA list, be prepared to wait in line (it goes pretty quickly) and enjoy!",
#NAME?,,Their chargrilled oysters are great. Everything else is below average considering how awesome the food is in NOLA.,
#NAME?,,,"Everyone at Oceana made us feel so welcome when we arrived for dinner. We walked right in, were escorted to our table upstairs. We arrived around 5:30 pm on a Wednesday and had no wait. The waiter was at our table quickly and we needed more time to look at the drink menu. We settled on beers but the tables around us that ordered cocktails had a dry ice smoke coming off of them. Pretty cool! We split an order of Crab cakes for appetizer. They were large, fresh, and the sauce was amazing. I ordered a half order of oysters and a Greek salad for my entree, my husband ordered the grilled ahi tuna, and we were both very pleased with our meal! I wished we had room for dessert!!"
#NAME?,"A million stars for the chicken but the sides were a little lackluster. The heat levels are perfect, I love spicy but not scalding and I thought the Medium did the trick and thought if I was feeling adventurous I could try the Hot. Well worth your time in the line. Not at all overrated. (The sides I tried were Mac N Cheese and Cole Slaw)",,
#NAME?,,,"Never again!

I'm at the bar sitting next to a lady. She orders fried fish and shrimp. I order a crab cake appetizer and we both just start talking.  Both agree our food lacks flavor but eat it. Her food is cold and has no flavor other than breading. My crab cakes taste eggy and fishy, as if they used old fish and too much egg to bind it to together. 

During the meal she pulls out a long hair out of her food that clearly didn't belong to her. To make matters worse, another lady walking out also asked her if she found a hair in her food.   At this point i ate one of my 2 crab cakes and literally lost the desire to eat any more. 

Jai, our bartender, and perhaps the only good experience I had at the restaurant got his manager. You would think at this point the restaurant would recover. Nope!  Daniel was a total ass. His comment to me was that I ate my food. He then goes to the register, prints my check, slides it across the bar in a shot glass, then walks away. 

Never again will I eat here, never again will I suggest anyone to eat here. I'll see to it that  no one else does either."
#NAME?,,,"Pleasantly surprised since this place screams ""tourist trap"" being situated between 2 daiquiri bars right off Bourbon street."

#NAME?,"REAL hot chicken and you DON'T have to cross the river to get it. :)
I've read the hateful reviews and wonder if these people just think you aren't eating real hot chicken if your not in the ghetto ... Well you DONT have to go to the ghetto anymore and Im not afraid to say it!
This is a great place AND they have beer!",,

Omg, the char grilled oysters!!!!! Seriously, life changing oysters. I was skeptical since I always shoot them raw, but they are AMAZING!!!!

Boom boom shrimp was good, but tasted like something you'd get in a Chinese place. The boo fries were their take on poutine, but they fell short. 

I will totally go back when I'm in town for the oysters! Delicious!!!!!",
#NAME?,,,"Fast courteous service!!!! The crab cakes are to die for!!!! Outstanding crawfish étouffée and the red beans & rice might be the best I've ever had!! 

Highly recommend this place"
#NAME?,,,"In the past 2 days we have eaten at Mr.B's, Arnaud's, Luke's, and Ruby Slippers.  Jennifer was our waitress and she was VERY accommodating and friendly.  My husband was a little difficult...he sent his Po-Boy back for more seasoning & then asked for more cheese.  He would agree that hands down this has been the best meal that we have had here!"
#NAME?,,"My partner and I had another great meal here this past week. The reason they only get 3 stars this time is that the menus were FILTHY! Mine had a short, curly hair under the plastic! DISGUSTING! We ordered and ate anyway because the food is always delicious. Crab claws were amazing, my oysters were perfect, his Roast beef po-boy must have been good, because he ate every crumb. Love this place, but could you clean those menus? And stop wiping all the tables with the same rag? It may have been clean at the beginning of the day, but after the first few tables, not so much.
Oops, this review was for the Metairie location, not the Quarter.",
#NAME?,,,"The food here is GREAT!!!
Crab cakes, catfish, gumbo, pasta, dessert...I could go on. 
Expect to be in a food coma. 

We tried to make reservations, but we couldn't on a Saturday night. We went anyway and were very surprised to walk right on in!

Our server was Mike. Great service and an awesome N'awlins accent to go with it. 

I will be back!"

Oyster and Shrimp PoBoy....
Had the grilled oysters also but not pictured.",

#NAME?,,"Maybe I'm missing a redeeming nuance of Acme oyster house. Upon our first try the wait was forty five minutes. We instead chose Dickie Brennan's with stellar results. The next morning we revisited Acme with no wait time; the interior almost half full with patrons eager to try a NOLA institution. 

Think old beer joint if your from Texas; two dining areas with the kitchen in the middle. I could see via the glass the chefs char grilling their famous oysters. A bloody mary to start paired with some fried craw puppies. Fried to a perfect golden brown, the pups worked well with the provided dipping sauce. 

I then ordered what I came for, the char grilled oysters. They were good, but not amazing. A word of advice, gobble them up as fast as you can because the cheese eventually sticks to the shell making it had hardened mess. Maybe I'm just a raw oyster kinda chap and should have ordered those instead.

Service wasn't that great. The wife never got the glass of wine she ordered. I felt once the waitress knew we were just gonna order a few items, her interest was guided to tables with more patrons. Recalling the line from the day before and noticing 15 minutes after opening Acme was at near capacity, my three star experience won't hurt their reputation.",
#NAME?,,,Touristy. It's got high ratings because it's off bourbon street and if you check in you get 10% off your check. Food is overpriced.
-yfClQ2lYd-7yxZ58aq1KQ,"If you are visiting Nashville...you gotta head out to Hattie B's and try their fried chicken! Once you've tried it, you prob will wana come back for more. Fried chicken comes in different levels of ""hotness."" I got the medium which was perfect for me. Chicken was crispy on the outside and tender juicy inside. I also got the chicken tenders which were delish. Get that if you don't like eating off bones.

Always a long long line...be prepared to wait 35-40 minutes
parking: metered street parking",,
#NAME?,,"Char grilled oysters yum yum yum :) must try
Veggie po-boy, Seafood etouffe & crawfish fries for side was good.",
#NAME?,"This is one of the most famous spots in Nashville to try. The lines are extremely long and can get very hectic in their establishment so just be aware of that and be ready to wait. The parking situations in the areas can be tough as well but apparently that is a common problem in Nashville.

The best tip I can give if you really want to try this place and avoid the wait is to go to their website and order to-go from there. You will choose a pick up time but even when you are there at your pick up time be aware that you still have to wait 15-30 after your initial pick up time so plan accordingly. I did not know this until after I arrived and tried to pick up my food. No line or organized area for pick ups you just have to find a space in the tiny place and wait.

The food was actually very good and full of flavor! I got the dark meat small plate with beans and Mac and cheese which was marvelous. I got the second to the hottest flavor and OMG was my mouth on fire and I can take spicy food! Loved the spice for sure and the meat was juicy.

I did enjoy the food but the frustration of the wait and how unorganized it can be put a damper on the experience. I'm glad I got to try it but only will go back if I had few time to waste.",,
#NAME?,,,"5 stars! Great drinks and good food! Got the crawfish ettoufee and their famous oysters. Food is flavorful. Great service as well. Also got the mandin house special drink and the boyfriend got the mango peach margarita.

Tip: check in on Yelp for a 10% discount!"
#NAME?,,The food was simply nothing short of the reviews! It was delish and pippin hot when it arrived. The wait staff was awesome as well!!! We will definitely be returning customers next month.  We loved it. Thank you!,
#NAME?,,,"Ordered the seafood gumbo and crawfish etoufee, both were delicious. Excellent location. Service was great, food arrived very quickly. Wouldn't get the margarita again, tasted like straight sour mix. Friendly staff. Would recommend for a seafood destination."
#NAME?,,,"Some restaurants in the area take advantage of the tourists. Some do not. It's the circle of life. From the day we arrive on the planet and blinking step into the sun there is more to see than can ever be seen, more to do than can ever be done.

And I don't think I'm really trying to say that Oceana is necessarily ""taking advantage"" of tourists in any sort of devious way. More so that it's about on par with going to Florida on vacation and wanting seafood so you go to Bubba Gump. It's about in the Bubba Gump league.

I don't really have anything to come down on this place for other than its middle-of-the-road level of cuisine. Service wasn't bad. A few hiccups here and there but nothing where I felt they were doing a bad job or being lazy.

Comparing the crawfish etouffee to Royal House was pretty damning, as here the dish had plenty of seasoning and no real flavor, if that makes any sense.

Tried the blackened alligator here, as I wanted to eat as many different types of alligator as I could before I left. It was fine, tasted like chicken. And they do mean blackened by the way, it's not just lightly grilled.

My main entree was the fried seafood platter. Plenty of food, but I'm not really sure if I could say it was a worthy dish. It all tastes fine but towards the end you start to realize how much grease you must have consumed. Also those oysters, man, if you aren't big on oysters there is apparently little that can be done to salvage that.

It feels like a chain, even if it isn't a chain. It feels so branded that it sort of finishes any hopes at atmosphere and the food itself, regardless of how freshly made it is, suffers by giving a reflection of being processed."
#NAME?,,"It's all true...this place is the BEST!!!  

We got the seafood gumbo, seafood ettouffe and the chargrilled oysters.  The gumbo was just ok, the ettouffe was wonderful and the chargrilled oysters were the bomb!!!",
0-2fExWTNYlXJj_aewQ8gw,,,"This was the first restaurant we checked out in New Orleans and it didn't disappoint. We made a reservation for 12:30 and it seemed really crowded when we first got there, but as the hour passed it slowed down a lot. The service was quick and friendly. We ordered gator bites as an appetizer and it was basically like chicken nuggets, so I thought they were delicious. For my main course I tried the blackened catfish po'boy. I didn't know what a po'boy was before this, and it's basically just a type of sandwich. It's a messy thing to eat but the blackened catfish was so good so it was worth it. It was cooked just right and had a great flavor to it. The fries were very crispy and enjoyable too. The atmosphere of the restaurant is small and nothing really spectacular, but the food makes up for it. I would definitely recommend this place!"
0-4GFJoSP5BmFR-ovJmcEA,,Be prepared to wait 40 mins-1 hr. The wait is well worth it!!! I am not a fan of oysters but after coming here I am obsessed. The service is great and fast. It is a little crowded due to large crowds (came summer 2019 before COVID) but the restaurant is spacious and really gives you that authentic nola vibe. We started off with the chargrilled oysters which were bursting with flavor. I decided to have a shrimp po'boy with fries as my entree. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and not soggy and the bread was perfectly crispy. The fries were also delicious. This hot spot is definitely a must try and your visit will not be complete without it!,

We tried them at the Bourbon house also and Acme kicked theirs all over the place! If you're not into the slimy raw version, these are definitely worth trying. We got the peace maker po-boy and I was a little disappointed.  Only 1 oyster and it was lacking some flavor and it could be the bread too. The fried crawfish appetizer was great and the sauce served with it was very flavorful with a little kick! Plan on returning in future but watch out for popular dining times as the wait could be long but the line goes fast and the service is good!",
0-hb63A9uWjR1YIyVMu6rg,,"Admittedly, we only went to one Oyster House, so I am giving this 4 stars with no basis for comparison.  This is not a 4 star restaurant in NOLA, but it is a 4 star Oyster House in my opinion, or at the least, a 4 star Po Boy.  Call it 3.5 if you want, but I am rounding it up.

A negative about this place, as you'll read in many other reviews, is the lack of reservations and space, so you literally stand on line outside.  But don't fret, this is common (oyster house across the street does the same thing).  The line moves pretty quickly, though a lot of large parties come, which tends to slow up the works.  Anyway, there were maybe 8-10 tables in front of us, including a party of 10 or more, but we were seated within 30 minutes.

During that time, we got some kind of blueberry martini (you can't bring in outside drinks, but you can get drinks at the bar while waiting and bring them back outside to the line - you gotta love NOLA).  Those were delicious.  Highly recommended.

I'm not an oyster eater - my girlfriend is - but the purpose of this visit was to get a good po-boy.  She got a 1/2 shrimp 1/2 oyster and loved it.  I got a roast beef po boy.  Essentially, a roast beef sandwich made to look like a po boy.  Kind of made me wonder what makes a po boy a po boy.  Give me some au jus, and this would have been the perfect french dip sandwich.  Regardless, I don't care if this wasn't a po boy in the classic sense - this was an awesome sandwich.  Enjoyed every bite.

The inside is a bit crowded and loud, but its NOLA, so that's what you get.  We were sitting at the oyster bar, so not the most comfortable location, but the inside is lively and pleasant and you can definitely have a good time here and a good meal.  Worth checking out.",
0-q3B91wVRMES5-u4OGHkw,"All of our friends, TIME magazine, and the Food Network have raved about this place so we knew we had to try it. We have driven by this location the past few days and didn't think we could stand the line. But today was our last day, so we waited in line for about a hour and a half. 

My friend and I split the 3 tender chicken and waffle brunch combo (only offered on Sundays 11 am-4 on). It came with a ""side of fruit"" (1 orange slice) and one side. We tried the French fries and added a side of the pimento mac & cheese. All drinks were only $2 unless you opted for beer (they had a pretty good variety). I got the lemonade which I highly recommend. We LOVED both of the sides. The atmosphere was great and the staff was incredibly nice. Also the place was very clean. 

The reason I couldn't give it five stars is because our waffle was cold and the chicken was okay but not as great as it had been hyped up to be. I think I would have really enjoyed it had it not been for the wait/hype. But I definitely knew what I was signing up for. I recommend it, but maybe try to find a time where the line isn't so long! I've heard between lunch and dinner time it's not as bad.",,

00Fr1B7van5p5JyoCgnueA,,Best oysters in all New Orleans. Don't get scared off by the line as it is well worth the wait. The grilled oysters are CRACK!  We literally could not stop eating them. We plowed through 4 orders. The raw is excellent as well. Extremely nice waiters. Venue is old world NOLA and an experience in and of itself. Treat yourself to an oyster shooter!  Highly recommend this experience for anyone visiting NOLA.,
00IPtk7iLBxuRDFBbVtlTA,OMG..Hattie B is the truth I went for lunch today and the chicken was awesome very favorable and juicy alone with the sides which I had the greens and potato salad I also had the banana pudding which was is a must so if you want some good chicken hot or regular this is the place.,,

Online prices are outdated - everything was a couple of $ higher. Would not recommend veggie stew - bland, tomato saucey flavor. Crab cakes were good but wife from Baltimore prefers Maryland-style. Taste of LA was ok but nothing special. Oysters on the half shell were delicious - the high point of the meal. 

Next time will leave daighter at the hotel with a pizza and go to another, non-family friendly place."
00rMMR7yCVDua_GDX8S0aw,,,"As someone who's lived in New Orleans my whole life I should have known when I walked in that this place was purely a tourist trap. I'm sure they make most of their money off of drunk tourists coming off Bourbon St. that know nothing about good seafood. 

A buddy and I were looking for a late night spot to eat dinner and this was the only place still open around the city. We sat down and our server told us they were famous for their crab cakes which I had intended on trying as well as the Oceana oysters. This was just the next mistake along with many more to come since choosing to dine at Oceana. 

Our oysters came out and were not sizzling like usual chargrilled oysters are, yet they were covered in a thick garlic sauce that can be described as gooey. The oysters themselves were incredibly chewy and after two I could touch anymore of the dozen in front of me. 

Shortly after, the crab cakes arrived and I had to send the first one back due to it being cold; upon biting into the crab cake I was appalled that a place in New Orleans can disrespect oysters and crab so horribly. Very little crab meat and mainly breading and onions, though the crawfish that came on top were not the worst I've ever had. I've had better frozen crab cakes from Walmart. 

Lastly, I ordered the special of the day (redfish Pontchartrain) and by this time I'm wondering to myself why we didn't leave when we first walked in and realized what type of establishment we were in. Alas, the fish came out and was somewhat blackened but the meat of the fish was tough and the shrimp onto in the cream sauce seemed frozen (like I'm sure most things from Oceana are). I pushed off the fish and tried a couple bites of the ""jalapeño cornbread"" that was more of a mush than a cornbread. That was it, I put my fork down and didn't eat another bite. 

If you have read this review and are thinking to yourself, ""well the other reviews sound good maybe he just has a vendetta against this place"" I urge you with every fiber of my being to try any of the hundreds of other seafood spots in the City, Peche for example is one of my favorites. PLEASE TURN AWAY FROM OCEANA"
00sd4WZqNGyHTb7_LxDwwg,,,Authentication of  New Orleans is found here.  Inexpensive but good. Only negative was my request to have waiter acknowledge my sister law bday that night and it wasn't.  We went down the street to fat cat abs the band song. I inky requested it because the prior reviews said it was done. Disappointed yet please wuthering food. Would go back but in the morning or for lunch and I'll request for waiters Erleen or the Barry white impersonation singer heard they were nicer. Our guy seemed to be anxious to go home.

Secret tip: drizzle honey on your hot chicken - yum!

Great sides also...black-eyed pea salad with nice vinaigrette dressing, southern (collard) greens, pimiento mac and cheese...

Very good local beers on tap.

Trying not to show my fear as we passed multiple red faced, sweating yet happy chicken eating patrons.  I ordered the ""medium hot"" small dark chicken plate. The food came out fairly quick, the portion was perfect- not too much not too little.  
All went down the hatch.  Spicy level was not bad at all, I was expecting much worse. Mind you everyone has a different tolerance level but for me the medium hot just had a small hint of spice so next time I will go for the gold and order the spiciest option.  Good beer too.  Safe to say, I'd happily return.

But when I sat down at the bar, the very kind oyster shucker/ waiter told me that the chargrilled oysters were now their bestsellers.  What a treat!  The chargrilled oysters were outta this world, complete with buttery-parmesany loveliness to sop up with the bread.  The raw oysters were also divine, as expected.  I wasn't thrilled when they sat me at the bar, but the waitstaff was lovely and attentive and there were several fantastic women (one from Savannah like me, go figure -- and the other from NYC/Baltimore) who joined me in short order.

Food - Mixed results. The chargrilled oysters were good. Not phenomenal, but good. The fried oyster and shrimp po-boy was unfortunately not that good. My wife's ""7 napkin beef sandwich"" was good.

We tried the the two hottest chicken levels, the ""Damn Hot"" and the ""Shut the Cluck Up"". I like spicy food and the StCU is definitely the spiciest fried chicken I've ever had, but honestly the Damn Hot tasted way better. 

The StCU spice was certainly unique, but the ""Damn Hot"" and ""Hot!"" tasted fantastic. If you only get the StCU you probably won't think this place is worth the hype, so don't be tempted to try it on your first visit.",,
07zgPowZ9npflBPiBf7otg,"The three stars are for the delicious fried chicken. It was really good fried chicken, but I a was very underwhelmed with the heat level. After reading reviews, I expected their chicken to be blazing hot and so I ordered cautiously and was a bit disappointed. I will admit to having a high tolerance to chili peppers from years of heating crazy hot food but I played it safe since I wanted to enjoy my meal and since this was just a pit stop on a road trip. I didn't need any unwanted side effects that can occur from eating too much hot food.

I ordered a small dark (leg and thigh) with a Hot! heat level and then one chicken tender at the Shut the Cluck Up!!! heat level. Between those two heat levels is a Damn Hot!! heat level which is what I probably should have ordered for my main meal. The chicken is served on slices of white bread which soaks up grease and sauce and the chicken itself is really well fried and crispy and flavorful. I just didn't find the Hot to be hot at all really. Now the single Shut the Cluck Up tender was crazy hot and while it was a good experience and I'm glad I ate it, I probably wouldn't eat a whole meal of it. What I wanted was a full meal of spicy chicken. I was just surprised that the Hot was mild in my opinion. I had the pimento mac n cheese as well and it was decent but nothing special in my opinion. It was nice to see a small selection of local craft beer on tap so I grabbed one of those as well.

If I'm in the area I would probably eat at Hattie B's again because the chicken was really good. But I would try the Damn Hot. They also had a long line onto the sidewalk but there's not much of a line inside so it's more marketing than anything in my opinion. It's not a big place but there was enough seating since the seating on their patio consists of communal picnic tables. And the patio is warm enough to eat on even when it's a bit cold outside since it has a tent around it.",,
088RHnhAEANbj5oWlQF2wg,,,"Loved the crab cakes! Very New Orleans (think sauce and crawfish topping).  The fried alligator was also tasty. 

I ordered the fried catfish poboy for a meal. I wasn't the biggest fan (couldn't really taste the fish between the bread and simply the lack of fish). I think they had another option (a grilled fish or something like that). It looked like the better choice. Everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their food though.

Our waiter was great. He was friendly and even gave us suggestions for some parties. He let someone in my group charge their phone and was very helpful.

This was a close 4 star."
088TyK1PAMGHgp3_z3GDFA,,,Food was good but service was AMAZING!!! David was our server and he was on point. Knowledgeable of their menu and very attentive. I ordered the chicken po-boy and felt it could have used more toppings on it. The French fries rocked though.

The atmosphere is kind of half sports bar, half restaurant. There were definitely tourists (it is in the quarter) but you could tell there were locals also enjoying the food. Service was friendly. Beer selection was decent. I ordered the fried crawfish tail po'boy. Mostly breading, very little crawfish, but overall good seasoning. My husband ordered the half shrimp, half catfish po'boy. He enjoyed the catfish half better. We also tried the barbecued oysters which had a nice char-grilled flavor. The raw oysters (which we did not try) are apparently pretty good too. 

Bottomline, if you like fried food and you are looking for decent food and friendly service, stop by while you are in the quarter. Word of warning...there can be a long wait. Personally I don't think its worth standing in line for more than 20 minutes.",

Unfortunately this experience wasn't our favorite. Firstly the hostess never greeted us instead just gave me a ""3 signal"" then we had the best servers Erica and the day prior was Fiona .

It comes with two sides and I ordered potato salad and mac and cheese. These were both delicious and lived up to the hype. Definitely visit when in town.

Chargrilled oysters are insanely buttery and have a nice garlic taste; they're piping hot. The raw oysters are sweet, and so fresh. The Boo Fries were the standout for me. If you like poutine, this takes it to the next notch and is piled on with roast beef. The seafood etoufee was a good way to sample their fried crawfish, which was well-seasoned and battered.",

I did not like the coke slaw though, was too heavy and I thought it needed it to be a little sweet. Other than that my experience was enjoyable.",,

The service was ok... not the best, but i suspect the large party in the back and the late lunch but too early for the real dinner crowd timing had something to do with that. 

The quality was exceptional.  I would go back there in a heartbeat.",

It definitely beat the LONG wait in the line.  Everyone in the line seemed to be envious that we were able to just grab our food and go.

We ordered chicken tenders and some fried chicken wings in ""mild"" with fries.  Definitely a bit spicier than mild for my taste, but man was it good.  It was perfectly crispy. We also ordered some slaw and pimento mac and cheese.  I was underwhelmed by the sides.",,

The shrimp was GREAT. It was seasoned and fried to perfection, I have never had shrimp that tasted that good in my life. NEVER. I will always stop by this place when I'm in New Orleans. I can see why people were willing to wait out in the cold. It was fantastic. I didn't care for the Gumbo but I've never been a Gumbo kind of girl. I did however like the RedBeans & Rice as well as the Jambalaya. The hushpuppies were great too although some at my table indicated that theirs weren't cooked all the way through. The fries could have been better, I sampled a few off someones plate (I know the shame) and I was not impressed they were limp and definitely needed somemore love. However their Fish, oh their wonderful and glorious fish. Magnificent. (drools) I loved Acme, and I can't wait to try eat there again. Too bad it takes 14 hours to get there.",

The most famous oyster bar in all of New Orleans.  Cool.  But really, if it weren't for the name it really ain't nothing.

It's stupid crowded.  Yes, you will be waiting in a line to get in.  Could be a 1/2hr, could be hours.  Remember your clubbing days?--like that, but without all the hot girls to look at.

We sat at the bar, just cause that's where they put us.  It was extremely uncomfortable (yeah even more so than the worst of other bars).  The chairs were cheap and slippery, and downright painful.  There wasn't anywhere to put your bags or backpack.  Just really crappy.  I was getting back pains eating my food.  I was also losing my voice trying to talk over the crazy loudness...

And the food...

1. Not Your Father's Root Beer $5.00

2. Raw Oysters 1/2 Dozen $8.99 ""ice-cold, raw oysters served with lemon and our spicy cocktail sauce"":  Well, at least the oysters were very fresh, and definitely served ice-cold like described.  Good sized oysters they were.  But compared to some of the fancy types I've had in CA, they were relatively flavorless.  6/10

3. Chargrilled Oysters 1/2 Dozen $11.99 ""sizzling, chargrilled oysters saturated in an herb butter sauce, topped with a special blend of cheese"":  They were juicy but pretty small.  At least the cheese wasn't overwhelming like some other places we've been.  6/10

4. New Orleans Medley $12.99 ""sampling of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice and grilled smoked sausage"":  Pretty much an average plate of everything you think of when you think of New Orleans.  I think the Jambalaya tastes like what they serve in school cafeterias across America, well, at least mine did.  The sausage was kinda dry though.  5/10

5. Fried Crawfish Tails $7.99:  THIS I do recommend!!!  (Thank God there's something good here.)  For one, thank you Acme for peeling all that crawfish for us!  I love that I can taste the meat through the crust.  I guess the sauce was a bit overwhelming though.  But damn, that was a good plate of fried crawfish.  8/10

So, there you go, the truth of universe right here.  Come cause you gotta.  Expect nothing.  Leave with bragging rights.

On my first visit the waitress screwed up the wine order for my friends, my oyster order and my side order. On the second visit I had gone to the restroom and when I returned I asked for and explanation of what craw puppies were and the bartender said ""I already told her."" pointing to my friend.

The first time I got the sandwich (medium heat) with the slaw and got to sample the mac and beans as well. If I could order every side - I would! Highly recommend ordering several sides to share to be able to try everything. The second time I went with the tenders and have to say they were just as good, but I missed the awesome combo of flavors the hot chicken sandwich brings with the pickles and slaw added on top. 

Pro tip: Call in your order and pick-up ahead of time to beat the lines! This may seem second nature now after the pandemic, but wish I had known the first time I visited a few years back! All in all, it's totally worth the wait.",,
0Hw2Zwn0Ow1G_McsV7SYJw,"First discovered this place when viewing a show by Andrew Zimmern, and I had always wanted to see if they had true spice levels to their hot chicken.  After living in Texas for umpteen years, I scoffed at Tennessee hot chicken, but they made. Believer out of me.  I had the large dark option - two legs and thighs - in their ""Shut the cluck up"" sauce.  After the volcano finished erupting from my mouth, I gobbled it all down, but I admit the beer tasted extra good.  Wife had a more moderate level and thoroughly enjoyed.  Our accompanying sides were bacony grits, greens and pimento mac & cheese, all of which pleased.

0IsswI9909_A6eG_8ny05g,,,"We stayed at a hotel in the French Quarter and kept asking everyone for suggestions on where to go.

Over and over, the locals kept telling us to go to this place. Our valet guy showed us his Instagram account and it showed his various lunch dishes at Oceana Grill. We were sold!!!!

I was shocked to see that I walked by this restaurant multiple times and I never realized that it was right off Bourbon St.  As we were walking up to the door, we noticed that there was a long line, but were quickly advised that the wait was only 20 Mins. We went ahead and stood in line and were seated in the time frame promised. BTW, be prepared to stand outside while you're waiting(rain or shine!).

We were seated right past the bar in Errol's area and I'm glad we were seated there. Still was very attentive and was great at making recommendations. We started off with their famous oysters and they were a total hit. They had a separate bar that prepped all of their oysters.  It was fun watching all the oyster dishes being prepped.

Oh, how can I forget the drinks?!??? My hubby ordered the Hurricane and wow, that sucker was strong!!!!!! Like SUPER strong. My brother orders the Bloody Mary and I have to say that it's the best Bloody Mary that I've tasted. Of course it's topped off with a pickled green bean. AMAZING!!!

Now onto our main entrees. I ordered the catfish poboy. Oooiii, the remoulade makes the dish! It was amazing. My hubby ordered the fried shrimp and he said that they were fresh and just amazing.  My brother ordered the Taste of New Orleans and the best thing in that dish was the beans and rice. I could just eat and that all by itself!!! I remember that as being the best dish ever!!!

The atmosphere of the place was typical New Orleans. This means that it's quirky and fun.

Got here when it was a baby line, but you better believe it'll wrap around the block in no time. We plopped ourselves onto the bar where live shucking was surgically performed. Suckers were huge! I really didn't even need saltines; the oysters were juicy and fresh. I think they could up the wow factor a bit on the cocktail sauce. It was saturated with horseradish that it was more of a paste. It made me miss the variety of sauces that Pappadeaux serves with their raw oysters.

We also downed some seafood gumbo to coat our tummies to prepare for the alcoholic binging that was about to take place. 

The gentleman next to me ordered the chargrilled oysters and they smelled like garlicky heaven topped with fluffy rolls.. next time! 

The restaurant is dirty and small. There was a drunk guy yelling the entire time trying to get all of the customers to sing happy birthday to his kin. MInd ya business. It's too small a place for all that noise.",

Also the blackened red fish was cooked to perfection and I don't just say that about any fish meal. Staff was quick and food was brought out in under 10 minutes. I would recommend This to anyone looking for a great taste of NOLA's finest food or the late night party goers.



Side Note- if your getting the jazzy crab cake platter just know the only difference between that and the appetizer is some veggies and mashed potatoes. $6 difference. Happy dining!"

More seating, a longer bar and more tvs.  My hubby got the crawfish omelet and all he did was make happy noises the entire time he ate. I got the seafood platter for breakfast (not really a breakfast person).  It was just ok. We each got a bloody mary. Wow that was one awesome drink. I'd come back just to drink those marys. The bartender was really nice (we ate at the bar) and the people around us were really nice too. I will definitely be back.  I just won't get the seafood platter for breakfast next time.

0KgqplyXwCzjeStc1BYK-Q,,"We went to around 4 different restaurants in New Orleans, and Acme was actually the best of these. Others have noted there are better, but we didn't find any. We had the crawfish, oysters (both raw and baked), Po Boys, and hush puppies and all were excellent. I think the downside is that you'll have to wait around an hour to get in, if not longer, but if you're looking for good New Orleans food, I don't think you'll be disappointed going here.

I'm not giving it 5 stars only because the food was good for New Orleans, but on average to restaurants around the country, I wouldn't say it's amazing, but not bad overall.","I don't know why this place is getting such high marks, but we weren't impressed with the food at all. In fact, I would say that this was the worst restaurant of all those we visited in New Orleans. I would go so far as say that our food we got at our hotel was better.

Anyway, I tried the Gator Tail Bites (half fried and half blackened), a dozen of their ""Famous"" Oceana's Oysters, and the Fried Oyster Po-Boy. Maybe I'm just not a fan of Gator Tail, but I didn't think it was anything special. If you're new to it, I definitely recommend skipping it since it's like chewy chicken.

The Oceana's Famous Oysters were by far the worst. There was barely any oyster and it was drowned in their butter sauce. It reminded me of what you might get at a Red Lobster.

The Po-Boy was decent, but not worth going there just for that. I tried 3 different Po-Boys and this was the best of the 3, but not by much.

Overall, we paid way too much for very mediocre food. If we ever come back to New Orleans, this is a place to skip."

I ended up going with the ""Damn Hot!!"" which is one step down from their highest heat level (""Shut the Cluck Up!!!""). I got a text that my food was ready right before the pick-up time, walked in and it was waiting for me right at the counter. The restaurant space itself seemed pretty cool though very busy. The food was excellent and wow, they don't mess around with the heat here. It was very hot, I can't even imagine it hotter but kudos to those who can handle that kind of heat!

0Kx1MRqRnwKvHY0kblXnJQ,"I love you Hattie B's chicken

I live in Silicon Valley California. My sister lives in Nashville. So when I fly out to see her, I have a chance to indulge in some good ole food from he south. What Bay Area boy shouldn't experience a meat and 3 - LOL..... 

I know Nashville doesn't have any killer seafood restaurants, Asian restaurants or hot tofu soups shops - but man o man - Y'all got some kick-arse fried chicken places. 

When I'm come to Nashville Hattie B's is my first stop in town. I just can't get enough. 

I went on a little fried chicken tasting frenzy when I was in Nashville last. I went to all the usual suspects. Feel free to see my other reviews. 

I understand and respect that friend chicken is a very subjective matter. For me, Hattie B's chicken is DA BOMB. 

Personally, I like it southern fried style, and I dip the chicken into a side of their hot sauce. I find that when the chicken is already sauced, it loses its crunch. Me likes me some crunch AND spicy hot goodness together. 

I don't care about the limited parking. I don't care if some of their sides are not as good as other places. I don't care if they have a line out the door (ummm hello, that's what telephone ordering is for). 

All I care about it their kick-arse fried chicken. 

Right before I left town I ordered a whole bunch to take back home to Cali. I even gave up a carry-on, so I can bring my chicken on the plane. 

Everyone on the plane hated me - but loved the smell of the chicken - LOL.... 

Hattie B's, If you ever want to open a location in Northern California - I would love to be potential investor / restaurant operator. 

Cali may have wine, seafood and ethnic restauants, but sadly, N. Cali lacks any ""real"" fried chicken places.

First for the barbecue shrimp, gumbo, and a delicious ragin' cajun bloody mary and then late that night for some jambalya and oysters, Oceana style. All the food was super tasty except for the oysters which were doused in some kind of overloaded sauce that was just too much to handle. The restaurant seems like a tourist trap, but for a taste of that famous New Orleans cuisine it's the place to go. We also had a GREAT server named Tiffany. 

Definitely worth a visit!"

My cousin said ""these crab cakes have us in deep thought"" bc not a damn word was said!! I mean scraping the plate! I'm usually a sauce on the side girl but I let it rock and I made a damn good decision to let that mushroom sauce change my life. *whispers* my crab cake was a little hard on the outside but I didn't give a damn. The crab inside the cake was flavorful and soft. I've been eating all foods that are put on my plate so the crunch of the lettuce was great! 

Cons: I had a shrimp poboy the concept is boring! The remoulade was okay, a fancy touch to honey mustard. The fried shrimp was seasoned but the bread was too damn hard. I actually caught an attitude from chewing! 

Moral of my review: Just eat the damn crab cakes. (That was my last damn)"
0LM1Wo88MGpybsP2FPSBSQ,"The food was great. Seems like there will always be a line- we arrived on a Thursday around 11:30 and waited an hour. My husband and I both had the chicken sandwich medium heat- it was the perfect amount of spice. Had plenty of flavor but if you don't love spice like some people this was perfect- paired perfectly with fresh pickles, sauce and some cole slaw. Sides were good, but the sandwiches were great!

Best part...The staff  was phenomenal. Super friendly, very attentive. 

Awesome place for dinner!!"
0M2emDhXluVIezCAkrWoyQ,"If you're in Nashville you have to try the local staple hot chicken. I went with the local recommendations and stayed away from the real hot stuff despite my love for spicy food. I went with the small white medium with a side of beans and mac and cheese. I was only in Nashville for 4 days, but I wish I could take buckets of this stuff back home with me. It was really good. Will certainly be one of the first spots I go back to when in the area again. Must try. Great food. Gets packed but the lines move pretty quick.",,
0M9TPocU2iihqAvrx6YUfg,"In an effort to satiate my fried chicken habit, my husband and I came to Hattie's while on our honeymoon in Nashville. I was a little scared by how busy it was, and skeptical of the order first, find a seat second. Places like that make me a little anxious.

However, Hattie's has it down to a science it seems, and after ordering my white plate (chicken breast and wing + 2 sides) we took a seat and waited for our meals. And hot damn! What a meal. Loved it from top to bottom. I ordered the medium spice, which definitely has a strong kick to it. My husband found it overly spicy for being ""medium"" just FYI. However, truth be told, had we not been going out that night, I probably would have gotten mine even spicier. Pimento mac and cheese was heaven, and the collared greens were delightful (beware vegetarians, however, they do have bacon in them).

Would love to re-visit this place the next time we're in Music City!",,

The parking wasn't great but the place was full with all sorts of people including families, singles, students and elderly. This place looks very fresh, warm and chic for a first impression. We felt like we were in a very friendly college atmosphere. Just like the other reviewer Cameron pointed out, it is a meal you want to eat like an animal and the good part is, everyone out there is basically eating the same way and having tons of fun doing it. This place lets you forget the pressure and enjoy yourself while eating those big chunks of spicy chicken. The side dishes we ordered included mac and cheese and beans. They were made in a completely different way than I had ever tried before. My kids loved them. Their root beer floats were totally awesome and especially the free refills totally made my kids's day.
We totally loved the outside seating. The vibe was so romantic yet cozy for a family friendly place. Would love to go back again.",,

The food was good, but if you're namesake is the food you specialize in, you might want to have more than 2 types of selection. We had the chargrilled oysters. It was good, but not 1.5 hours of wait good. This place is total tourist spot (i guess to be expected). We went and waited only because of a friend recommendation, otherwise we probably would have chosen another place.

Ordering was fast and easy, and we got pitchers brought right out. We managed to get 9 people in on one of the outside picnic tables. It was a tight squeeze, but we had some big dudes. Food came out quickly and accurately. The chicken: amazing. Medium was hot enough if you like spicy food but aren't feeling adventurous. One of us got the extra hot and it ruined him for the night and part of the next day. It's all in the fried and skin--which is crispy like a Korean fried chicken, but southern savory and spicy. Sides were good as was the service. I'm going back every time I'm in town.",,

When we walked up there was a line outside the door for people waiting to enter the restaurant. It didn't take that long to be seated (around 10-12 minutes). Even though they were really busy and had a full restaurant the entire time we were there, they managed to get our order out in a timely manner. 

I had the seafood gumbo and my husband had the blackened steak. The gumbo was really good. I cleaned the bowl. My husband ordered steak well done. Although it wasn't well done my husband still enjoyed it. It was more like medium well, with more pink than he is used to, but he really enjoyed it. 

We would definitely visit this restaurant again if we were to visit New Orleans."

Food:
Blacken red fish: delicious, if I could order one dish, this would be it.
Jambalaya pasta: cannot go wrong, another great recommendation.
Cajun Fries: more than I expected, I was expecting something dry, it is heavy in sauce and crawfish, not bad. 
Blacken duck: taste like a heavily seasoned chicken.
Crab cakes: taste like the ocean with extra salt, definitely not fresh
Great option when lots of restaurants are closed."

The service was even better! We had a large party of 9 and everyone's food came out within minutes of each other. We each loved our food so much we shared it with one another. The best part was that we had one main server but when other servers walked by they asked us if we needed anything. We will be going back before our trip is over! I ordered the catfish poboy blackened... best I ever had!!

The chicken still packed plenty of spice and was overflowing with juice underneath the skin. The macaroni and cheese was creamy--not dry like some baked macs at BBQ joints. The greens were dotted with pork and pot likker. My dining companion and I shared the homemade banana pudding for dessert. If you decide to try Hatti's, be prepared in wait in line. Even though the line moved quickly, we had to wait about 20 minutes to get inside to order. Seats are picnic tables outside, so you'll be sharing with benches with strangers.",,

I ordered the hot chicken sandwich and the potato salad paired well with it to balance out the heat. Some of my friends got the fries and mac and cheese on the side and they were all delicious too. If you want to avoid long lines, go at an unconventional time or order it online for take out but I would say Hattie B's is a must try when in Nashville!",,

We got there early, still hungry from the small portions of our lunch at Commander's Palace, and glad we did.  Our server was funny, friendly, helpful and very flexible about our order.  We started appropriately, with the oysters.  They were fresh, and just perfect, even in August.   

We went with wine and po boy and gumbo, and glad we did.  The gumbo was great, but the beef po boy (Italian style) was awesome and worth another visit.

0PbM7Czq7PRN5vsZ_zGbwQ,,"For a place that came so highly recommended, we were actually pretty disappointed. We ordered the fried crab claws, fried crawfish, the oysters and the acme special poboy. We sat at the bar because the place was full and those were the only seats available, which we didn't mind. The issue is that the bartender who took care of us pretty much ignored us 95% of the time we were there and rarely bothered to check on us. Even when we asked for the check we waited about 10 min and had to remind her. Then she never came back for it so we had to flag down the other bartender to give him the card. 

The oysters and the acme sandwich were top notch! Absolutely delicious and if I ever returned here it would be for those oysters for sure. The sandwich was really good as well, full of flavor. The fried claws and crawfish were bland. There was no seasoning or salt in the batter at all and we had much better at other places in New Orleans.",
0Pg8Ka3T7AFEpLzzADuDXg,,"I've been lucky enough to eat oysters all over the country, I feel that The Acme Oyster House is just not all its cracked up to be. 

My party didn't have a long wait-5 minutes after our name was taken. (Most waited at least 40 minutes.) 

The server, Rene, came to the table fairly quickly.  I feel that it took too long to get our non alcoholic beverages (10 minutes) and even longer to get the oyster shooters and cucumber/basil martini.

The raw oysters came to the table before the charbroiled. I had a few raw oysters that had shells, which is never good. There wasn't really a flavor (saltwater, tininess, etc.), making me rely on Tabasco. The charbroiled oysters were tasty but extremely rich.

I feel that Acme was just so so because of the long wait times and the overprice.",

The bloody mary was really good and the chargrilled oysters were so tasty. Definitely gong back.,

0Q1FC3rbRJeHIsYsqxuuww,,"This was definitely a let-down. 

We liked the raw oysters, although some of them were extremely small, not much bigger than my toe nail. Wtf? The people who don't eat raw foods liked the chargrilled ones. I'm in the first camp. While the chargrilled ones are tasty, I prefer my oysters to be naked and not dressed in two inch thick cheese. BUT to each his own. 

We (large party) waited for a good 40 minutes outside. It was no biggie.  And to go off topic a little, I spent that time looking up some ""bad"" reviews and was extremely amused by some of the comments. One person said the raw oysters are bland....well, I doubt you will find a non-""bland"" raw oyster anywhere in this world. 

Anyway, back to the food. Everything outside of the oysters were quite bad. This is not the first time I had Cajun food but these were some of the worst gumbo and jambalaya I ever tried. The gumbo was runny and everything was bland. Most of us ordered the peacemaker Po Boy. I didn't think these were all that special. Fried seafood is fried seafood. I've had the same version all over the US at Cajun joints. 

This place is a PASS, especially for tourists who has had exposure to Cajun food before.",

We were able to get in a bit quicker since we were willing to sit at the bar. Server at the bar, Curtis, was great. We ordered the shrimp and oyster po'boy and a dozen of the charbroiled oysters along with a pair of oyster shooters. 

Po'boy: delicious but could've had a bit more seafood inside it. Well fried and bread was perfectly crispy. Everything was fresh. 

Oysters: this is where I was a bit disappointed, as I thought the strong flavoring on the oysters made it impossible to taste the oysters themselves. They also were pretty heavy. 4 of the dozen came out burnt around the edges and tasted burnt. 

Shooters: I've had shooters in multiple occasions in San Francisco and found that the vodka was much harsher here than shooters I've had previously. 

We're glad to have had the chance to try this place but probably would order differently next time.",
0QUsL71djwab6NUR6C6TAg,,"Acme is probably the most talked about oyster place in NOLA. With great power, comes great responsibility. This is a HOT spot for tourists and is on everyones list for best chargrilled oysters. Well, when you have that much hype about your dish, you best better believe that I am expecting the food to live up to the hype. 

Unfortunately, this was not the case. Ah. I almost feel bad giving this place a 3 star. And maybe it is all mental, maybe I was expecting too much, maybe all my friends shouldn't have kept telling me ""this is the best oyster you will ever have in your life"". It's GOOD. Don't get me wrong, but I was not blown away. To be honest, I actually like Felix's Oysters better which is literally 20 steps across the street. 

I didnt have any of their other popular dishes like the jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, gumbo so I can't speak to that. 

But hey, give it a shot. It's the ""most popular"" oyster place for a reason. but don't rule out trying other options either. Definitely give Felix's a try as well.

0QwB_0ODAc0RAy8ToNMeFA,,"My family and I went to visit New Orleans for the day and we were looking for a great place to eat, so I called my sister and she and her friend told us about this place.  

We waited about 20 minutes outside the restaurant before we were seated and within moments ordered our mean.

For starters we had the chargrilled oysters as well as fresh oysters and both were very good, and very fresh, no gross fishy after taste, BONUS!  

For eats, we had deep fried soft shell crab, ham poboy (for my toddler), New Orleans Medley, and Jambalaya.  HOLY MOLY DONUT SHOP!  SALT IS ON SALE!!  The batter for the soft shell crab, the jambalaya, and gumbo were extremely salty.  The sausage itself was not as salty as the others and had a great smokey flavor, but was a little dry for my taste.  We did enjoy the red beans and rice.  It was the only part of our meal outside the oysters that we were able to finish, otherwise you would need quite a bit of water to get it down.  Too bad our server didn't answer to our call of thirst.  Our glasses remained empty until the bill arrived when she asked if we needed more water. =(

Overall, there is a bit of a wait outside, our server wasn't as attentive as I was hoping for, the food was salty and the oysters were delicious!  

Will we eat here again?  Of course, but only for the oysters, however, we may find another place that has great tasting oysters with better food than what the Acme Oyster House has to offer.",

The line did move very quickly, despite us having a group of eight- I have that positive thing to mention.  The food was not very good for the cost, and the portion sizes were small.  I had an etouffee and chargrilled oysters again, and they were both disappointing.

First off, when you walk in, the entrance way has foul smelling odor. I know it's close to bourbon but you all can clean up. The oceana oysters are nothing like chargrilled oysters-even the picture on menu is misleading. The gumbo was bland. Crab cakes had more breading than crab & were so think, still had a hint of frozen taste to them. The BBQ shrimp were soupy. The only thing our party of 10 liked was the fried seafood & the creme brûlée. They put dry ice in some of the drinks which is a bit odd as well when the drink comes to your table bubbling without a heads up. 

Overall, idk how they have 4 stars on yelp. A lot of room for improvement."

Don't believe the hype about the quality of eating here. It is nothing special This place is maybe a notch above a dive. I think it took less time to order, eat and pay than it did to wait.  I ordered a dozen of the raw oysters and these boys are HUGE and...flavorless. They were also dirty and not cleaned properly. For being so near the gulf I was seriously underwhelmed. Nothing like what I've experienced before. 

I also ordered the seafood gumbo ""Poopie"". Lets just say I've had a better bread bowl at Panera, and the gumbo was bland and overcooked. It didn't taste fresh at all. Texture was mush all around.

Good thing the wait moved briskly and was only about 30 minutes. Longer than that is not worth it. If you have to go, its only to check it off your ""list"". If its for food, save your time and money.",

The only saving grace of this place was the gator tail bites and they were DELICIOUS. Highly recommend. We got half fried and half blackened. As for the gumbo the shrimp looked like canned shrimp with the poop still intact. The bread was stale. The Cajun jambalaya pasta had some suspect looking meats inside of it. The crawfish etouffee was also suspect tasting. We could not even come close to finishing anything. This place said they had the best bloody in New Orleans, but let's face it every restaurant says they have the best bloody in New Orleans. The bloody was okay. We were able to keep the cup the bloody came in. We couldn't get out of this restaurant fast enough."

We ordered the chargrilled oysters, the boom boom shrimp, the roast beef poboy and red beans and rice along with a couple of drinks.

The drink prices were low and the alcohol strong and after waiting outside for 30 mins on a wednesday night we were glad to have it.  The oysters were disgusting if you want good charbroiled oysters PLEASE GO TO DRAGO'S.  These were half cooked, slimey and runny in the middle just terrible.

The boom boom shrimp was delicious if on the sweet side, and I wish that had been the only thing we ordered.

The roast beef poboy was tasteless and almost inedible.  It was soggy like eat roast beef that had been sitting in water.  The red beans and rice were just plain and nothing to write home about.

This place really only has one great quality and it's not the food it's the servers.  The polite guy working the line, getting reservations and drink orders.  The waitress who knew the menu top to bottom and was efficient and friendly without being pushy.

Also, do they really recycle oyster shells because I definitely saw a server dump them all in the trash.  Maybe they don't anymore, just an observation.

Come for the experience I guess, but if you only have a short time in NOLA, go to Drago's instead.",

I just love the taste.  Chicken was so soft and tender and full of flavor.   I tried med level for spicy but it was still spicy for me.  I wonder how spicy when you make it real spicy.

Be sure to avoid prime time since line gets very long.  I went there around 3 pm and I had to wait around 15 minutes.",,

0XfMCMZiEF42-W88Wc6maA,"First time Nashville visitor and this place was recommend by everyone. The hype was too much and it was a disappointment. Came for Friday lunch and there was long line, but it did go by fast, probably a 10 minute wait, but most of those were just pick ups and we were dine in.

Drinks(5/5): Ordered some local brews and they were tasty.

Food (3/5): I came with two others, and we wanted to try multiple things and we shared most of the items, chose medium/hot as the levels, didnt want to go to far to damn hot/cluck up.

Hot chicken sandwich was probably the best item we had, the sauce really made the sandwich exceptional.

Jumbo tenders were just overly dry and salty.

Dirty bird fries were decent, they became soggy really fast, I guess you had to eat it fast because of the mac and cheese.

We chose potato salad as the other side, and it was actually really good.

Check (5/5): Most item on the menu is around $10, if the food was good, I would agree its priced very correctly and would be repeat customer.",,
0XoYlQXDFeMu79b_pxaxbA,,,"Long delivery arrival time but accurate. Had the crawfish alfredo and it was beyond delicious, I can't compare anything too it you will have to try it for yourself! Also ordered the blackened catfish very yummy! Can't wait to try all the food in the restaurant!"

0YI0fA3naGahJHRH6RnDzw,"Always great food. We used to live pretty close to the Melrose location and got Hattie B's fairly regularly. The jumbo tenders are amazing. The mac n cheese is the best in Nashville, I usually just did two sides of that. I also really like the greens and potato salad. Comeback sauce is fabulous. It is pretty spicy and I usually get mild. Hot will make you cry. 

The peach cobbler is awesome too!",,

Ordered the Cajun fries with cheese, crawfish and mushroom sauce. It was good however I'd recommend asking for light cheese as it was entirely too much cheese in the dish, I actually couldn't finish it due to how much cheese was in the meal. They also offer a 10% military discount so that was awesome! Definitely recommend the oysters and gator meat!"

Thanks to our server Errol for the excellent service that this place is known for!

0Z8wuResK3pHXUPQlQCnUw,,,I really expected better from this place based on the reviews. It is located right off of Bourbon St.. We were seated almost right away which was a plus - but it all went downhill from there. Our waitress was sweet enough - but the food came out and it was very clear that this restaurant pre-prepares their dishes. The foot came out super quick - as if it was just sitting and waiting to be picked up and served. I ordered the shrimp platter - it wasn't warm at all. My girlfriend ordered the special - which was Red fish with some sort of topping. Hers was also cold and tasted horrible. We just ate what we could and asked for the check - and surprise surprise her dish was $30 (it wasn't on the menu) and my meal had an upcharge of $6 because there was a crawfish cream topping on my French fries (of course neither price was disclosed by our server). Instead of complaining we just paid and got out of there. Go there if you want a subpar meal - but be prepared to pay the price of a premium meal when the check comes.
0ZCgrT2VK3NXFDo0qLGqyA,,,Breakfast was perfect. This is our go-to place every time we're in New Orleans. The food is great and the service is exceptional.
0ZRG_OQw4flvDedvAbPJHA,"A Nashville MUST!

Chicken-regardless of the spicy ness you decide on, its amazing.   

The sides aren't where it's at otherwise 5 stars.",,
0ZUN_H8JJAkmVWr6Ve0Yzg,,"If you want Oysters, THIS is the place to go.  We got there about 7:30pm on a Saturday night and there was a bit of line outside.  **PLEASE NOTE**  Acme does not take reservations.  It's first come first serve.  However, the wait wasn't that bad though, maybe 30 minutes.  Acme is one of those little hole in the wall type places.  A small restaurant in the French Quarter with a big reputation, and after eating there it's easy to see why.  The staff is super friendly, must be a New Orleans thing.  

I got the charbroiled oysters on the half shell.  Now I knew what I wanted before I even got there, so it is my own fault I didn't read the menu closely.  I am used to steamed or grilled oysters on the half shell that are plain and come with melted butter and crackers.  That is what I was expecting.  Not what I got.  These oysters have melted cheese on them, a romano cheese I believe.  Also tons of melted garlic butter, heavy on the minced garlic.  I am not complaining!  OMG these were DELICIOUS.  

Be warned though if you have any sensitivity to heat, these have a touch of it.  I asked the waitress and there is no pepper or hot sauce, so my guess is it comes from the tons of garlic they use, or maybe from the type of cheese.  I have a pretty strong sensitivity to heat, so I felt it, but it may not bother others.  I also happen to LOVE garlic, the more the better!  These oysters definitely deliver.  The melted garlic butter over flows.  A dozen of these oysters comes with 6 slices of crusty french bread, great for dipping in the butter.  

My fiance got the shrimp po boy, and loved it too!  He gave me one of the shrimp to try and you can tell it was fresh.  Delicious seasoning and a HUGE po boy sandwich.  It filled him up.  None of the sandwiches come with a side, you have to order them separately.  We split an order of yummy hush puppies.

Definitely a place worth visiting again!",
0ZbfYFiJivUzGWgOmjDRXQ,,"All I can say is if you come here you better try the grilled oysters, everything was great but those were over the top, there was a line to get in which took about 15 minutes, and once inside the service was a bit slow, but they were absolutely cramped, not a single table available, I can say it was worth the wait but not sure if I would try another place next time I'm here just to have a comparison","This place was delicious, the tuna steak was cooked to perfection and the crab meat burger was delicious, parking can be a hassle if you have a car but there is a valet parking for the sonesta Hotel right across the street, if you are in New Orleans definitely give them a try"
0ZjfbkzHOuXbLKSarBb-9w,,,"One of the better places we have eaten in the French Quarter. The baked oysters were so good and so much butter to sop up with the bread. I really wish I had gone back for a Bloody Mary. I will be there again!
The only reason I took off a star was the service. Very lackluster at the bar."
0ZmNWorn7JcmEbvVCjPLrg,,"YES, YES, & YES. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try! Acme was # 1 on my places to try in NOLA and it FAR surpassed my expectations. I came to try the chargrilled oysters based on the rave reviews. Not being a huge fan of oysters in the past, I was a bit skeptical but how bad could anything with melted cheese and garlic be? So I gave it a shot and was blown away! I ordered a half dozen to share and immediately regretted not getting the full dozen. The oysters tasted fresh and that garlic sauce was amazing, perfect for also dipping your bread into.  It was so good that I came back the next day to order a full dozen all for myself.

We also ordered the catfish and shrimp plate. It was a great portion with good flavor. I liked that it wasn't heavily fried. I left feeling completely full but not like I overdid it. 

Service is also very attentive. No complaints whatsoever. If you want to give your tummy a treat this is definitely the place to go!","Two weeks prior to my trip to NOLA I began scouting restaurants and foods that I had to try and Ocean was #2 on my list. I was pulled in by the yelp pics of the mardi gras pasta and delicious looking crab cakes. Who doesn't love a great crab cake?!  So on my first day visiting I had 8pm reservations scheduled and I was EXCITED! We were seated promptly and I was ready for a great meal! I ordered both the mardi gras pasta and the crab cake appetizer and two desserts. 

The crab cakes weren't at all what I was expecting. I was hoping for it to be full of lump crab meat drenched in a delicious creamy sauce and I didn't really get either. The sauce was just ok, the mushrooms in it were great, but the crab cakes themselves were not good at all. Tasted like filler and not much crab. I tried opening it up to get to the crab meat but unfortunately there wasn't much to get to. I didn't even come close to finishing it because the taste just wasn't there. This was a huge disappointment but I still held out hope for the mardi gras pasta!

The entrees came out very fast, like under 10 minutes, which in this case should've been a red flag. The mardi gras pasta was edible but not at all enjoyable. It tasted like it was missing something...I rarely add seasoning to my food in restaurants but for this one I added salt just to get some type of flavor going. The sauce was very thin and didn't really stick to the noodles and the seafood in it didn't have that fresh taste that I was hoping for. The pasta tasted reheated by microwave. 

By this point I was completely disheartened because everything I had been looking forward to try was substandard. Being a glutton for punishment (and still very hungry) we decided to give their world's famous bread pudding  and creme brulee a try. Sigh, I'm sure at this point I don't have to tell you how that went. The creme brulee tasted oddly like sweet potato pie and was very cold. The bread pudding was nothing special though I did enjoy the caramel drizzle that they added. That drizzle was the highlight of my entire meal unfortunately. 

Overall this was a huge disappointment. I hope maybe it was an off night but I doubt it was."

0_efE9rkt5hNIsBXUsbyGw,,"Amazing.  Best meal I've had in New Orleans, hands down.  After waiting for close to an hour in a line rounding the corner, I would've been rather mad if it wasn't.  My party of five ended up consuming three dozen oysters (two chargrilled, one raw) in addition to our separate dishes.  Of course, the oysters, though they varied in size, were masterfully shucked and flamed.  It was pretty cool watching the cook's process as he grilled and cheesed and sauced each batch.  Each dish is delicious-- I had a bite of the Peace Maker Po' Boy (half fried oyster, half fried shrimp), which was delicious, and we also ordered the New Orleans Medley (cup of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, sausage), Poopa Gumbo (in a bread bowl), and a bowl of Seafood Gumbo.  Even the littlest one in our party (two years) ended up devouring six chargrilled oysters.  He has a picky preference for the gourmet and ridiculously tasty, and Acme's certainly provides that level of quality.",
0_qXVv_-a5P2yyDNeml_7A,"I absolutely love Hattie B's. I am a hot and spicy kind of gal, so when I moved to Nashville and heard about this ""hot chicken"" thing, I was all about it. Hattie B's was the first hot chicken place I tried and I must say, it was amazing. Their chicken is so moist and the breading is not greasy or soggy like other places I've been. They totally deliver on the heat level as well. The first time I went I ordered hot because I was sharing, and it was very flavorful. The next time I wanted to up the heat so I got damn hot, and oh man! It was quite a jump! However, I loved it and I am now addicted. 

The sides at Hattie B's are also pretty good. The Mac and cheese is very cheesy and delicious, but I think their grits are just average. Their potato salad is also good, not great. Overall though, their chicken is the best and most important part and they completely deliver on that front! 

Go on Sunday's when they have hot chicken and waffles! You won't regret it!",,

0a4EOL1zf-plY4j8imj9nw,"After nearly an hour long wait in the line to get the chicken, I am not sure if it has loved up to the hype. Overall, very good chicken but not the out of the world taste that I was so excited to try. The breading is done well, the frying temperature can be improved a bit (parts of my chicken was a bit burned). The atmosphere is fantastic if you're visiting the town. The energy is infectious. Parking can be a HUGE pain so it's better to Uber yourself in. If you're with friends, that hour goes by easier.",,

I'm going back tomorrow one more time before we leave. The raw oysters were just ok, not much flavor. We had also ordered the smoked sausage poor boy sandwich and it also was fabulous. We highly recommend acme oyster house.",
0aH9QrxAxD8tEEVVOVv3kA,"Was it worth waiting in line for the better part of an hour on Sunday, including running back to my car to feed the meter some more change? Yup.

I had a guest in town for the weekend, and it was my job to show her Nashville. I figured it would be tragic to have her come and go without experiencing the hot chicken sensation, and somehow I hadn't been to Hattie B's. It seemed like a good time to kill two birds with one stone.

We both went with the Tenders ($9), hers being ""hot"" and mine being ""damn hot."" I would have tried the ""clucking hot"" if I hadn't been on tourist duty the rest of the day. Call me crazy, but the idea of honky toning down broadway while a fiery inferno erupts in my stomach didn't seem like a great idea.

Despite the line, finding a seat outside wasn't really a problem (although I did notice it being an issue for some people who drifted in later). Our orders came out within 10 minutes, and I was definitely pleased with the size of the tenders. 

The damn hot variety definitely had some heat to it, but true spice aficionados won't have any trouble with them. The sides--I got beans and the pimento mac n cheese--were decent too. The best part is the bread at the bottom that soaks up all the cooking oil and spices from the outside of the chicken. 

Overall, I see why there's a line during peak hours. I'll definitely be back.",,
0aJLwGXBVIe6a99f4lxOmA,,"We grabbed seats at the oyster bar on our first night in NOLA.  We shared 12 fresh oysters and a giant plate of fried shrimp, fried oysters, fried catfish, fried softshell crab, and... fries.  Hah.  The catfish was soooo good.  Moist and meaty.  But the softshell crab was the star of the show.  So worth adding to the plate for the extra few bucks.  Well, I take that back.  I think the real star of the night was the old man with the thick N'awlins accent who came up to me and kept pretending (?) to pour his red wine on my head.

I admit it.. I let the reviews here spook me. I dialed it back to ""Hot"" for my first try. Wifey got medium. 

It took a while to get our chicken, about 25 minutes by my count, which is about right for fresh fried yard bird.  My chicken was DELISH!!!!  I wanted more spice in it, like.. a lot more. I should have went all the way on the spice. My bad!  Wifey was on fire.. Medium was too much for her. That was fun to watch.

The dish she described sounded to good to be true so my friend ended up ordering it (it is not on the menu) Blackened fish with shrimp over corn bread, with a side of greens. I ordered the shrimp Po'Boy since I have been craving for a good one for a while now. We were seated upstairs and got served fairly quickly since it was still early and not a lot of people were out wondering around Bourbon. The Po'boy came out filled with shrimp and the bread was decent. I was expecting a little more oomph with the flavors but I didn't get it. The taste that I got from my friends dish was actually very good. It was just a tad bit too salty for me but it was still good. A lot of my friends ended up telling me about other dishes I should try if I ever go back and I will try those to see if I could get what I missed out on from the Po'boy. I would suggest coming and trying this place out if you are in the area."

The crab cake appetizers were raved about in reviews so we tried them; OMG...  I've never eaten a crab cake with their crawfish sauce with that much crab and perfect seasoning in my life.  Two large crab cakes, perfectly crispy on the outside and just plain perfect inside and out.  My husband had the Blackened Redfish Lafourche; for some reason, not on the menu (just ask for it) crawfish mushroom sauce with fried crawfish on top!  My husband saw the dish on The Food Network and knew he had to have it, it was perfectly blackened, not burnt and amazing seasoning there as well.  I had the perfectly sautéed Oceana Redfish with that amazing crawfish mushroom cream sauce and plenty of fresh crawfish tails on top.  If you are afraid of crawfish, just push them to the side and eat everything else, nothing to be afraid of unless you don't at least eat everything else on your plate.  My husband and I are from/live in New Orleans and we've had dishes like the ones described above and we both are positive we've never had anything THAT good in our lives!  
Our server was Cole and he was one of the best waiters we had ever encountered; so much so that I asked to meet his boss to tell how awesome Cole is.  His manager, Tammy, is incredible as well!  
Between the over the top food and service, don't wait to get there; don't be afraid if you see a line!  It moves amazingly fast and it is well worth the wait; trust us, worth every minute and every penny for every bite.

I keep making the mistake in getting hot instead of medium (or mild) spice level, because compared to most places, I usually have a decent spicy heat tolerance. However, the hot made me actually cry; each bite hurt after the first few bites. My friend, who has a very high heat tolerance, got the ""[Dang] hot!"" spice level, and she thought her chicken was pretty spicy. I would say the seasoning for the chicken is a bit too salty. You will likely have to wait in line for this popular salty, spicy chicken. It is pretty reasonably priced, maybe a slight pricey. Overall, pretty good--but not fantastic for the hype it has.",,

Line and wait to get seated. Not Oceania's fault, but adds to the list of more minor issues. 

Once we were seated, we waited a while to have our server even introduce herself. Got our drink order in and I told our server, my wife is very thirsty, can we get her a water as soon as possible?  Was told no problem. We waited a bit but my wife ended walking up to the bar to get her drink. When our server did bring waters, my wife's cup(plastic) was cracked. No one noticed initially,  but it was leaking everywhere and made quite a mess. 

Food came out in a reasonable time. However, server drops food off and never gave us any silverware. So we had to wait for her return. 

Thankfully food was good. 

However, the meal was somewhat expensive for this type of venue.  With tax, tip and one cocktail(wife only ever had water) no appetizers, the bill came out to over $80 for 2 people.  At the end of the day I did not feel this was good bang for the buck. Food was good but not $80 good. Service was definitely not $80 service."

We both started with a cup of Seafood Gumbo, AWESOME!! For the main meal I had the Fried Shrimp Platter that was spicy and scrumptious, and my husband had Shrimp Fettuccine that he votes as the best he ever had.

I'm not from the south and was told that the the spice is real, I got medium and  it felt like extra hot! But never the less delicious.

The blackened or grilled selections all seem to be excellent.  I ordered the blackened duck which was quite good.  

The service was quite good other than at the host station.  The hostess was not very friendly and was more interested in keeping the doorway clear that getting our party of 10 seated.   Our server was a little dull but was up to the task of our demanding group.

We went to Nashville to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary and besides the Grand Ole Opry, this is the only other thing my husband wanted to do/see/eat. It didn't disappoint. Definitely in the top 10 list of foods ever eaten.

Thankfully I read everyone's reviews as I was in line and decided to go with the Hot level. I love spicy food. Like typically a 9 at a Thai restaurant spicy. So it I wouldn't have read the reviews I might have gone Cluckin hot. I'm so happy I went with hot. It was the perfect amount of heat. My husband got Damn hot and while he loved it, said he wished he got hot too. 

We both got sandwiches with Mac and cheese, greens, and beans. The sides were just OK. Not bad but not even close to the unique taste of the hot chicken. The greens were my fave if I had to pick one. We also got extra pickles which served as a nice little palate cleanser between bites. 

We were told this location had the shortest line but when we arrived at noon on a Sunday it was still an hour and a half wait. So not sure if that's true.

We waited maybe 20 minutes before we were seated and the room was bustling with business. We were visiting New Orleans for my bachelorette party, so we ordered several dishes and drinks to really get a taste of everything.
We started out the order with a dozen chargrilled oysters and two spicy oyster shooters. The shooters were a kick in the face and exactly what we needed to warm ourselves up from the chilly 30-degree weather outside. 

The chargrilled oysters came out with bread for the herb butter sauce and cheese that the oysters were saturated in and let me tell you, those were the best oysters I've ever had in my entire life (and I live in coastal south Florida). I could taste *everything* so distinctly, and the sauce was so delicious, we asked for more servings of bread to soak it all up. For my entree, I ordered the Acme Poopa; a french bread bowl filled with your choice of gumbo (my choice was the chicken and andouille sausage gumbo). The dish was warm, hearty, full of flavor and delicious textures (and was also my first time trying gumbo). I'd definitely order it next time I'm in New Orleans. My friends ordered the fried fish po-boy and the Acme Poopa but with seafood gumbo instead and they didn't have enough for leftovers. 

By far, Acme was my favorite restaurant of our entire trip. 
The service was excellent even though there wasn't an empty seat in the house and there wasn't a single thing I didn't find delicious and worth every cent.",

Jambalaya and étouffée was of the better that I've had so far, pretty good though I've had better, but the oysters definitely earned its stars.

Acme is a must when visiting New Orleans, sure glad I didn't skip this! Although I should mention that if you have to choose between Acme and Cochon for oysters, it should be Cochon hands down.",

Most of the dishes were pretty mediocre... jambalaya was overly salted, crawfish tails had too much breading, étouffée wasn't flavorful enough, but the chargrilled oysters... OH MAN. They are to die for and literally nowhere else tops them. You mustn't skip out on this place when you're in this city, bc you'll regret it for the rest of your life.",
0lXyh91o_62cRV3RmtGemA,,,"I got the:
- Smoked bayou duck with crawfish mushroom cream sauce
- chargrilled oysters dusted w/ garlic and cream herb cajun sauce.
- raw oysters
- fried seafood platter with oyster shrimp catfish and crawfish tails
- bread pudding w praline and rum sauce

Service was on point and Jaime was very helpful and professional. I liked that I got a window seat overlooking the people snarfing their meals in the courtyard.

At this point I had cajun and fried foods for the past 2 meals and slowly getting sick of it, but I persevered and was determined to try the last one at this 3k yelp reviewed place.

The oysters came out first and as my brother and Jaime preferred raw, I demanded a dish of chargrilled bc we were here to get the taste of nola, not fresh oysters. The raw ones were gigantic and I am not a fan of big oysters, but they went down smooth only thanks to the special cocktail sauce with some grated parmesan? The chargrilled oysters totally killed the raw (for me) because it masked the oystery taste with a killer buttery creamy burnt cheesish taste and they were small.

The smoked bayou duck had a deep layered taste. The perfect crispy savory skin lead to the oil rich fatty layer that then led to the moist meat portion. Instantly I was on a boat on the bayou with my bass shop pro gear shooting ducks like that ancient game duck hunt. Needless to say this was a great dish, but some parts the fat was too overwhelming to swallow and drizzling down the sides of my mouth. The crawfish cream sauce went especially well with the duck as the sauciness added a slightly herbal veggie accent to the flavorful duck.

The seafood platter was exceptional as the fish was a soft but firm texture and the breading was airy and didnt have an especially strong taste, perfect for the light and slightly sweet tartar sauce. I would skip the fried seafood platter and go for something more like the crab cakes as there seems to b a certain batter that nola ppl like and maybe these restaurants don't stray far from it.

At this point I was stuffed but I had to try the bread pudding and it was crack... i never had such thick soft sweet syrupy bread pudding that one bite put me in the middle of the land of milk and honey sittin atop the soft boobs of bread w praline brown liquid gold drizzled on top of me.

This place was really awesome, but no more cajun for me for awhile I think I'll have to go veggies w minimal taste to get my tastebuds and cardiac health back"

When we were seated, the bartender did take a while to take our order but the food came out quite fast. The chargrilled oysters were absolutely DELICIOUS! Their price for chargrilled oysters also is cheaper than some oyster bars in the area. The chargrilled oysters come with bread for you to soak up the butter sauce at the bottom of the dish. Overall, it was a great experience and if you can go during a time when they aren't that busy or when there is a very short line, GO!",

I also had the seafood stew.  It lacked flavor and tasted watered down.

I don't plan to ever eat here again unless I'm forced to do so 

I think it's a tourist attraction but not good for true foodies."
0mjRWW3pyIZLLXbkB5RT3Q,"I love Nashville hot chicken. Love love love it. I'm not going to tell you one restaurant is better than the other. If it's been in business at least a year, it's probably good. 400 degrees, Prince's, Bolton's, all great joints. Nothing but love.

But Hattie B's, Hattie B's. Oh boy. This place has flavor. Major flavor. I'm not just talking about the chicken. The sides, the lemonade, the cobbler. Hell, even the decor. Just an awesome place. I started with Medium to calibrate my scale, and it was hotter than your typical buffalo wings. I tried a bite of my friend's Damn Hot, and it's damn hot indeed. Not quite 400 Degrees hot, but hot enough to burn the fool out of you. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's a very slow burn.

The chicken itself is major high-quality. Super juicy, perfect breading, and FLAVOR! While I was eating a wing the breading fell into the baked beans. I took a bite of the beans and it was pure heaven. But it ain't just heat. There is some serious taste in this bird. If you eat Nashville hot chicken and can go back to KFC you're more flexible than I, friend. 

We finished with peach cobbler and it was super delish and super southern. Man I love living in Nashville.

Two complaints: the beer in the plastic cups. I understand why they do it, but I like my beer as cold as possible. Local crafts are also overpriced for what you get. But it's tough to get beer and hot chicken together, so I guess that's a cross I'm willing to bear. 

My second complaint is that they only have one high chair. There were several toddlers there, including my own. The picnic-table style seating made it okay, but it would be nice to have more than one. Psst--owner! High chairs are stackable. With the amount you're charging for beer you should be able to afford some more, pronto!

Bottom Line: Hattie Bs deserves to be called Nashville hot chicken. I'm not going to forget the other places, but Hattie Bs is in the rotation for sure.

TIP: you can park behind the restaurant on the weekends, despite what the sign says.",,

One person got a fried platter and the breaded white fish was absolutely fantastic.  Light, flaky, and extremely tasty.  I was impressed.

I ordered the gumbo and it was really good. It wasn't too runny and I didn't need to ask for extra rice or anything. The jambalaya was ordered as well. I was told it had a nice flavor.

Food was great. The raw oysters were yummy and the chargrilled oysters were really good! Best ones I had out of all the places I tried out. 

We also ordered a burger, that was just a normal burger. Asked for med rare but got med well.

Yummmm...","I came here twice... each experience was different. 

The first time we came here, I wasn't expecting too much only because it was a Kitchen Nightmare restaurant. How much better could it be than what they showed on TV? 

I was pleasantly surprised. Their oysters looked like they were on steroids. They were juicy and delicious. The chargrilled oysters were cooked in creamy alfredo like sauce. I ordered the blackened catfish and it was melt in your mouth delicious. The roasted vegetables on the side were in a little sauce cup. Not impressive at all. I also asked for a side of rice and literally it's about 1/4 cup of rice for $3?! No thank you! 

All in all, my first experience there was really good! 

Now the second time, we went back for the oysters since they were so juicy! First off, we had to wait in line this time. Lame. The place is HUGE. Three floors, with an outdoor seating area. You even had to wait in line for the bar seats. Who does that? So freaking weird. 

We only wanted oysters and something else small. The waitress gave us attitude for just ordering apps. Oysters this time around were big and plump, but they tasted like they were soaked in water. Disgusting. We also got the BBQ shrimp appetizer, and they don't come with heads! It looked so sad in the little dish. Experience here, ruined."

0rAO_DBsZ6FLaNUzyZdT7w,,"The charbroiled oysters are definitely worth the wait in line. My husband and I visit New Orleans yearly and we eat at this restaurant each time. I always refer friends when they are traveling to NOLA. This visit we shared shrimp, a cup of gumbo, and the charbroiled oysters. I didn't care for the gumbo, but the oysters and shrimp were so good I forgot we ordered the gumbo.",
0rCC3XlrqOr94zVZ9JS9gw,,"With 800+ restaurants in NO, why the attitude at this place?

Had to try Acme for the roast oysters. Let me say, this was by far the worst, least friendliest place we've been to in a very long time. We got there at 4:00 on a Sunday afternoon, when there was no wait outside. So as we started to open the front door of the restaurant to enter, a staff member bolted out of her chair and barred the entrance! She stated we ""had to stand in line"". Now, picture this: it's about 100 degrees, 100% humidity, there is no one in sight on the street, but she pointed to the roped off ""line"" and told us to stand there. We waited about 5 minutes, ready to storm off, when she stuck her head out and told us we could come in but they only had space at the bar. There were many empty tables---especially in the back---but we took her word for it and headed to the two stools she pointed out...which were right next to the nastiest smelling garbage cans where the staff dumps all the refuse. When we asked for another place, she snapped that nothing else was available. For real? Luckily, two people further down the bar were just leaving, so we just moved onto their stools, earning us a nasty look from the hostess-with-the-leastest.

We ordered beer and the oysters, as well as a po boy to share. Good, but not worth the crappy service we endured. Everyone was surly, and they even argued w/each other. No one seemed to want to be there, and neither did we.",

0rSGFE48wyhSsiTTH-rasg,,Chargrilled oysters is hands down the best thing ive ever eaten.  po boys were excellent but could of used some extra filling.  Raw oysters are excellent and fresh.  Get there early as the line gets crazy and these guys do not take reservations,
0rjfUeMGOxWe3Fm3dCihYg,"Went here for lunch on a weekday.

Parking: The parking spaces in front of the store says that it's a paid parking reserved for Hattie B.. So.. yeah.

The place isn't crowded at noon, service is nice, cashier is smiling.

The crowd is a good mix of few tourist drinking beer in the middle of the day, and office workers at lunch time.

Food is good, it's reminds me of the KFC in Asia, so crispy and spicy! The whole experience is very casual, it's a good alternative for take out or lunch. Fried chicken, what can possibly go wrong, right?",,
0rtQ5rjWcPUib49ghjFokA,,,"This was our first stop for food when we hit Nola. My drink (El Diablo) was tasty and strong, served in a cute Light up crawfish souvenir cup to take walkabout. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta for my entree and it was amazingly delicious! Finished it off with a warm piece of pecan pie with homemade whipped cream. Our server Jess M. was pleasant and helpful. Reasonably priced for being located right on Bourbon St. 2 DOUBLE drinks, two entrees and two desserts ran me $84 not including tip. I definitely recommend stopping in for a bit to eat and drink!"
0sMFm4ByoWLPkLhvdrOqrA,,"I have been looking forward to my visit here since my husband always would rave about it when he traveled on business to NOLA. We waited in a medium line, but it went quickly as we stated we be happy to sit at the bar. When you sit at the bar, you get to.see the shuckers at work. They are amazing. It was only a few minutes and the two dozen oysters we ordered were put before us along with a cold beer! What a feast! To get a fresher oyster, I think you would have to dig them yourself! The shucker told us he probably does a couple thousand a day! Nothing fancy, just great oysters!",

0t1bO84SpM-fzZwuuGc14A,,"Finally got into this place without having to wait in a half block long line. I was 
Kind of disappointed. It is very loud even though it wasn't full. It's much more casual than I expected. I had the fish and shrimp. The fish was very good but the shrimp was below average. The hush puppies were barely warm but tasty. Good potato salad. I guess I expected something more spectacular and it was just average.",
0tI41zr-a9SCf-kAVvaxxw,,"After a 20 year absence, my husband and I returned to Acme.  20 years ago, I enjoyed the rogue-like personalities of the men behind the bar and how they interacted with the patron, namely me--7 mos pregnant and having oysters with milk--I was the brunt of quite a few jokes.  

We waited in line for 30 min to get a place at the bar.  Got the oysters and this time with an Abita beer.  The men behind the bar--more interested in the women with the Hustler shopping bags.  Took them awhile to acknowledge our existence.  Now the oysters--watched these beautiful LARGE oysters being opened but they were separated from the ones placed on the platters served.  I guess their used for the grilled oysters or poboys.  I would have gladly paid more money to try them.  

Nevertheless, it was somewhat disappointing.  The oysters were good but Luke's were bigger, tastier.  I would still recommend this place because it is a NOLA institution.",
0t_FDfhuzcvGUbSNXGf7fg,The chicken sandwich is awesome. The best I ever had. Sorry chik fil a.  Beware of the Damn Hot style it is pretty warm.,,
0tceLhFuw1GW9IKr3RR78g,,"On our way to TX we happened through NOLA. This was my first experience at ACME and though my trip was a couple of weeks ago, I still think about the char-grilled oysters we enjoyed!  I definitely plan to return and if you are looking for a great taste of New Orleans they have a great sample. Don't leave without trying the oyster shooter and a hurricane. They are legitimately the freshest and most delicious.",
0teIBt553fO1_ey9X_6h6w,,,Good food. Okay service. Crabcakes and crawfish sauce good. Shrimp poboy tasty. The service was pretty quick again.
0tiR-Xnv8P61Oz0JhctdXQ,,"I love the Acme Oyster House, but with over 7,500 reviews, there is not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  So I'll keep it short, and just touch on the highlights. 

Some people complain about long lines.  We were fortunate and did not have a line.  But even if there is a line...the food is worth it.  

I had the Peace Maker Po-Boy (oysters and shrimp) and added grilled onions.    It was delicious.  My wife had the Acme Special Po-Boy and declared it the best Po-Boy she's ever had.  We had a side of very tasty Hush Puppies.  I also enjoyed an oyster shooter.  

Service was friendly and flawless.  

It's a little touristy, but I can't ding them for that.  The Acme Oyster House has been around for over 100 years...  I think that's all you really need to know.",
0uGo8_YgoU23m5lHo_ItSA,"Good food, great crunch w the fried chicken. I got the hot chicken sandwich with potato salad and the pimento mac n cheese and all of it was amazing. So glad we stopped to eat here before we left Nashville.",,
0uNsOrs_XH479Q7fn4yOow,"More salty than spicy imo.

Line was short. Believe the name of the cashier was Kaylee..not sure if that was her name, but she was wonderful! Friendly, helpful, inviting and answered all our questions.

We waited for our food, one of the orders came out and after about 10 mins we noticed the customers after us were being served. A worker came to us and let us know they messed up and skipped the rest of our order. She said they were working on order and it would be brought out next. Then...other customers were served. We waited but after more minutes of seeing all the other parties receive their orders, we asked what was going on. She said she'd go check and the gm Mike approached us.

At first it felt like he was making excuses, repeated the same thing we were told previously, they're working on it will be next out. Have to admit, at this point we were over it bc we just heard it before and then saw other parties being served. He apologized and recognized there was an error and went to check on it. Soon after, our order came out and he gave peach cobbler.

Rocky middle but the people there are nice and made up for the mix up. We tried all the sides, sandwiches, chicken tenders (grilled) and chicken breast. Sides were good especially potato salad and greens. Not a fan of their Mac n cheese, could be cheesier.

Tried the chicken at mild, medium and hot. It did get spicier but honestly tasted salty for me. Took some of the skin off...besides that the chicken was juicy.

+ their banana pudding and peach cobbler was really good! Sweet, obvi, but good to share if you can't do so much sugar.",,
0uZqn7KMg8NA7WBwlIxZ7Q,,,"Went to Oceana for breakfast...the food was good, nothing out of the ordinary but tasty and got the job done quickly. The best part was the service...5 star service from our waiter, Ponce. He was very warm and welcoming as well as attentive throughout the meal. Would like to go back and try the lunch or dinner menu in the future."
0v7mAQURAkDT4uGhk1WV-w,,,I am giving Oceans Grill 5 stars just for the service. Our waitress Pamela was amazing. She ordered our drinks for us and everything delivered was delicious. The Jameson mule was excellent and went great with my burger. Pamela was very engaging and knew the menu. There was an error with my order and Pamela was quick to correct it. I will make sure to let anyone know who plans to visit NOLA to come see Pamela at the Oceana Grill.
0vGc0grQu5CDHTqa2UX9jw,,,The food and service here are great.  I wish we would have tried it earlier in our trip because we would have gone back a couple times.
0vRbUIv4E_C0wO-G5ekSiQ,,,"This place has a crawfish mushroom cream sauce that they put on a lot of their dishes, and that cream sauce is so good I could eat it by itself. It's like a delicious gravy that covers the food and adds a nice amount of richness without feeling too fatty. There's also a good amount of crawfish which gives it a nice shellfish flavor.

I really enjoyed the crab cake appetizer. It had a ton of crab and was a very tender and flavorful. It also came with the crawfish mushroom cream sauce which gave the lean crab a nice richness. The blackened bayou duck was also really good. The duck was super tender and meaty, and the skin had a nice Cajun rub that added a bunch of flavor. It also came with the sauce that I love so much. 

This was a great restaurant and the service was fantastic. It's also a good place for tourists who use yelp because for your first check in, you get 10% off your entire bill."
0vaaMugPM1uOGDri1T3lJQ,,"Worth the line, this place is a must if you like seafood !!!  All the food was great and our server was also very attentive and fun.",
0vlfV2Xnd2f94Ms36CswYA,,,We went here very late on a Friday night. The service was slow and the food was not memorable. I split a Po Boy and some drinks with my hubby and we were left feeling like we needed to try another Po Boy while we were in town to get the real experience.
0vtXnG0ClmKHHl1Gn19JIQ,,"Still my favorite place in NO. Yes, there was a 15 minute wait for a table for 4 at 7 pm on a Wednesday on the street next to a smelly alley. OK, that actually was pretty gross. 

This is a place where I get a Bloody Mary, even if it's dinner. Spicy and garnished with lots of limes and pickled green beans. Chargrilled oysters are not to be missed, oyster po boy is perfection. 

Worth the wait!",
0wJAQn_JEKti0xfwu0a-5g,,,"Great food and our waitress MARY was great. Mary made some great recommendations from the gumbo to the fish special, blackened redfish. The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. The service was great from start to finish. We highly recommend."

For some reason they had lost our order and we sat for maybe 15min when a waiter came up and asked what did we order, sorry for the mess up and gave us two beers on them and also their peach cobbler for the inconvenience. We didn't think we had waiting a long time BUT once he took our order again, LITERALLY minute later he was back with our food. This place is definitely a go to place. You might wait a while to be seated but the food comes out right away.",,
0xmdYTIKGdTuiGagFq8uVg,,"This was my favorite place to eat in News Orleans. I even bought a tshirt and I never do that. Highly recommend the oyster Rockefeller soup. Raw oysters the size of my hand and an oyster shooter made right. The boiled crawfish were fresh and amazing. And, best of all normal pricing, not doubled for the tourists. 

The line to get in can be long, but go early (4:30 -5) or  (after 9) very late and you shouldn't have a long wait. Ate there 2 days in a row, that's how great the food is. Very casual fun atmosphere. If you're a real seafood person you won't regret it.",
0yD8SKjmXt71QY-Y8z3rag,,,Food was amazing had a lot of flavor. Good customer service John was an amazing waiter and gave great service. Food came out very quick and hot.
0yQEVmNs7AMp2HFp2LBHuw,,"I wish I had done my research and saw that there were lines here before we decided to stop by at 7 PM on the Saturday before Halloween--- our party of 3 was quoted 20 minutes and ended up waiting over an hour. Parties of 2 had a much shorter wait and they were continually pulling couples out of the line to seat them ahead of everyone else. 

Raw oysters way to go here. #rawsome I didn't love the chargrilled oysters because there was too much cheese on it--- it overpowered the delicateness of the oysters. My friends enjoyed their seafood gumbo and everybody agreed the crawfish puppies were good. Ordered the Peacemaker--- which is a mix of shimp and oyster on a po'boy-- pretty darn good as well! 

Overall a solid spot if you're willing to wait.... but there are so many oyster bars in New Orleans maybe your time is better spent eating elsewhere that's not so crazy busy.",
0yVsVqJZyb8ianONy2cveQ,,Sweet mother! Charbroiled oysters make you roll your eyes back and forget your name!  The only thing that matters is to get that bread to sop the juices and then rack up the next dozen. Listened to suggestions to hit Dragos and did it. Don't. Acme is worth the wait so deal with it. Or time your visit to minimize the line. You'll be happy regardless.,
0yYb7ASPww6BwxW8P3xIgQ,Do you like it hot? Hattie's chicken is spicy and tasty.  Dinner for two with a beer was $25.  The line looks intimidating but it moves real quick.,,
0yeYeEICOfacgB1eSURcWw,,LOVED ACME OYSTER HOUSE. These were the first chargrilled oysters I've ever had and they were delicious. We ordered a dozen and I wish we had a few dozen more. I will defiantly go back.,
0yyXKmdI9lHxFKzomy6yfw,"What could I possibly say that hasn't already been said in 4,000+ reviews? This was our first stop after driving 8+ hours from Chicago. PRO TIP: please order it online for pick-up, don't wait in the 90+ minute line. Your food is ready for pick-up in about 30 minutes. Actually, what ended up happening was we were waiting in line and saw we could order online. We were  happy we ordered online because by the time we picked up our food, ate it, and came out the building, we saw the people who were behind us were still in line! Yeah, the crowd gets insane.

My friends and I got 2 orders of 1/2 nashville chicken with the following sides: fries, coleslaw, collar greens, macaroni and cheese. We thought the sides were subpar. My friends got the mild chicken but we got the Nashville hot. My god, this chicken comes out piping hot from the fryer. It is juicy, tender, spicy, EVERYTHING you could ever want. Our order was around $30, a good deal for 4 people. I saw someone eating a chicken sandwich, that looked bomb too. Since it is so packed, it might be easier to take it home and eat it instead of dealing with the crowd and lack of arm room/table space.",,
0z2dSC4kL2b-K02xx_XKYg,,,Awesome food awesome service. Staff was so pleasant.  Our waitress Ashleigh was amazing !! Coming back net trip to NOLA.
0zDHiDbj79uBOy3OAcE25A,,"Ambiance: the most popular oyster house in town, with over one hundred years of history, because they don't take reservation, so expect long waiting lines, minimum thirty minutes and it's not surprise if over one hour, bar style restaurant, packed seats, you sit back to back with other tables

Service: our waitress was very friendly and patient, though the fresh crawfish ran out after we ordered, she acknowledged us right away and suggested another delicious cuisine 

Food: variety of choices and overall great taste
  RAW OYSTERS - ***** ice-cold, raw oysters served with lemon and spicy cocktail sauce, so fresh, fatty and juicy, melting in the mouth, I like their sauce a lot too, highly recommend
  CHARGRILLED OYSTERS - **** sizzling, chargrilled oysters saturated in an herb butter sauce, topped with a special blend of cheese, very flavorful, recommend
  Jambalaya - *** seasoned rice with smoked sausage and chicken, average taste
  SEAFOOD ÉTOUFÉE - **** seasoned in a buttery roux, with seafood over rice, and we add fried crawfish tails, creamy sauce and tasty, recommend 

Price: moderate portions and reasonable prices, about $20~$25 each person","Ambiance 3/5: very narrow and dark inside, and the restaurant has a few different sessions, more spacious, much quieter and cooler upstairs, better to make reservation before come, otherwise waiting time could be long

Service 3/5: a bit slow, the waiter who served our table wasn't very friendly at the beginning, he ignored our table and served another large group seated way much later than us, though he explained in the end he didn't know we got in first because of shift change, anyway the manager on duty was super nice and very patient

Food 5/5: overall great taste, awesome food selections, and you have to save some room for desserts 
  Louisiana Crabmeat Cakes - *** served with crawfish and mushroom cream sauce, though it's marked as ""most popular appetizer"", I think it's lack of crab meat and too salty 
  Oyster Rockefeller - ***** the classic sauce with spinach, smoked bacon and pernod liqueur, topped with a blend of fresh grated parmesan cheese, heavenly delicious, highly recommend
  Oceana's Famous Oysters - ***** freshly shucked Louisiana Oysters on the half-shell, chargrilled over and open flame, smothered with unique zesty garlic and cream herb cajun sauce, finished with a fresh blend of parmesan and romano cheeses, another heaven taste, so I suggest you do half rockefeller and half oceana's, highly recommend
  Redfish Oceana - *** signature dish. sauteed redfish topped with own crawfish mushroom cream sauce, served with roasted garlic potatoes and vegetables, the fish was very fresh, however too thick and flavorless inside
  Taste of New Orleans - **** Creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice with smoked sausage, rich in flavors, recommend
  New Orleans Bread Pudding - ***** served with famous praline and rum sauce, though I wasn't happy with the service initially, I have to say the bread pudding here made my day and became happier with every single bite, highly recommend

Price 4/5: generous portions and reasonable prices about $30 per person"
0zWfsEXMpkBz8ONS0yPg5Q,Outta this world and worth the wait. The service was top notch and their food lived up the reputation. We lined up and the experience was well worth it. We would all go back again.,,
1--vGlFDFhhnUj_SI4in0Q,,"Blech. Won't be back. I've never had so many shells in my oysters ever. There was a piece of napkin in my corn and crab bisque. Won't be back with all of the other choices around. We wanted to order more food but I was worried at what might be in it. Had to ask for water three times. The server was nice, just super stretched with the busy night.",
1-FEOVWpt-9WR_gSOPu1Sw,,"Okay so this place is a ""go to"" spot for tourist. Well, I guess there is a reason for that, the food is amazing! I tried both the Oysters on a half shell and the Chargrilled Oysters both were amazing, the Oysters are fresh! Way fresher than any I've had in other cities. And the Chargrilled Oysters will change your life. They are so good. I tried the soft shell crab po-boy and man was it amazing, the side items left a lot to be desired. The red beans and rice were surprisingly bland to me, and is the only reason Acme is getting 4 stars instead of 5. 

This place gets crowded quick so if you don't want to wait forever I'd go for lunch instead of dinner, and I think it's worth the wait to sit at the Oyster Bar.",
1-G2EVBMdDKGRQDBc8DprA,"First thing first! Of course there was a long line, but a long line only means one thing. It's going to be good and it most definitely was! Actually, better than good. Irresistible. I had the hot chicken sandwich (special sauce- is so d@mn good) with a side of the mouthwatering pimento Mac N Cheese. Let's stop right there! I've tasted many macaroni cheese and this is the SECOND BEST I've ever tasted. That's HUGE coming from me. (I need the recipe or something close. That's the desperation you have after you taste it.) I also had a side of there greens which was southern and delicious! Let's not miss the coleslaw that was on the sandwich as well. The combination on the sandwich was perfection! (I'm drooling as I'm writing this.) Some good advice, don't waste your side on the fries. The hand squeezed lemonade was refreshing on a hot day. I honestly have no complaints. Wait! I lied. My only complaint is that there isn't one in Chicago! Hattie B's please move our way!",,
1-OYllFCl4yI_LmHHSyRgA,,The food was pretty good. There is always a long line waiting to get in. It's a little loud for my personal preference but would go back for the fried oysters and fried crab claws.,
1-crUWtdCwGAOyBcXhrfgA,,,"Have been to Oceana Grill twice and have had a pleasant experience on both occasions. We were seated in less than 15 minutes and the staff was all around friendly and caring. Food is good and so are the prices. I had the seafood fried platter and it was very good. Portions were large (enough for two people), flavors were great and food came out promptly. We also had the blackened duck and fettuccine Alfredo and both were a hit with my family members, especially the duck. I love the kindness of the waiters and hosts, they make you feel right at home and are very knowledgeable of the menu and actually encourage to try New Orlean's traditional flavors. I did not give it 5 stars because I have really high standards instead of flavors. But Oceana's is always a good place to eat at and it is right in the French Quarter so no need to go far from where the fun is at."
1-icjsOsrv-zxIvWr2VW0g,,,"Definitely a restaurant to check out when in NOLA. Crawfish/Cajun Fries are a MUST! If you enjoy the taste of mushrooms, you'll definitely enjoy this meal. Perfect amount of crawfish tails on top as well. I would say it's shareable with either a big group or just two people. My boyfriend and I also shared the ""Taste of New Orleans"" which consists of jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans with rice and sausage. This was a great platter to try out if you want a sample of some of NOLA's traditional dishes. They were very kind enough to split our dishes as well! Most of the locals we came across, recommended the to get the gator blackened. Definitely brings out the taste of the meat more than it being fried."
106wG4gjDNLIrLUYgCcTqQ,Not worth the wait for locals. I got second to the hottest and it wasn't hot at all. The flavor is good and the sides were ok.,,
109TBEivcWj_U23f1mwnCg,"Wow they weren't kidding when they said that the chicken is hot. But it's a nice burn that builds rather than something that numbs your tongue senseless. I went ahead and got the hot chicken tenders. I definitely wish I had some ranch towards the end to cool things down, but it was a worthwhile experience.  The line was hanging outside the door when I stopped in, but it was a nice day and people in line are always inviting and I had a chance to chat with some strangers to pass the time. One last thing is the parking situation seems to be a little dodgy, you've gotta back out into a street (yikes!) some patrons said that you can ""watch the show"" since fender benders seem to happen on a regular basis so just be careful!",,

10qbisF4sIqX7eDCtrQnWw,"I approached Hattie B's with a bit of reservation - wondering if it could actually live up to the hype. Well... it totally does!

I was quite impressed with everything from the food to the service. The fried chicken is excellent, amongst the best I've ever had. The dark meat came out a bit more tender than the white (my wife had a small white meat medium and I had a large dark meat hot). I'll say, the hot is fairly spicy, but not intolerable (fair warning, I do eat quite spicy). Large was a bit too much food for me - their serving sizes are pretty large!

For the value, I don't think Hattie B's can be beat. Great food, incredible prices, I'm hooked!",,

Also, there was no line when we went - around 5-530ish, so best times is probably mid-late afternoon to avoid dinner or lunch rush. 

We ordered two dozen of their raw oysters. Yup..we each had 12, AND ordered the oyster po-boy. Can't get enough! Anyway, needless to say, probably one of the better places to-go to for oysters. Not really a fan of the charbroiled oysters (since I feel like you can't even taste the oyster with all the stuff layered on top). The poboy was excellent...wish we had po-boys back home! 

Definitely try to stop by here if you're visiting NOLA!",

I've never had oysters before but I loved the chargrilled ones. It comes with garlic bread. Yum! We also had boo fries which were fries with roast beef gravy and melted cheese. Bangin! I was on a mission to get gumbo that night so I went with the new orleans medley which came with gumbo, jambalaya and red beans. everything was AWESOME! Prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly. We were being jerks and sat the table talking for a long while but noone tried to kick us out. Definitely going back next time I'm back in NOLA!",

My fried oysters were way over-cooked with too much breading.  The oysters were tasty and briny once I picked off all the breading, but that kind of ruined it for me.  The garlic fries were pretty tasty, the best part of the meal were the hush puppies, wonderfully crispy and sweet.   Probably not enough to make me come back though.",
130zaozQk5sGfl5pX6YOxQ,,,"Located within the French Quarter, this restaurant was amazing. From the minute we walked in, we were greeted with a warm smile. Our server, Megan, was very knowledgeable about the menu. I t ook Megan's recommendation with the Chicken Perdu and was extremely satisfied. The chicken alone was very flavorful with the perfect amount of spice. Paired together with the French Toast made my mouth salivate leaving me wanting more.
I would highly recommend this restaurant. The stairs were a little pain in the ass but we did just get off a five day cruise and have our sea legs."

The raw oysters were good too.
The New Orleans Medley (gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice and grilled smoked sausage) - was good to sample all the foods without being overly full.",

14bY0FMawgIQGCtVsCD1Yg,"Let's start this review off with WOW!! I was in a long and desperate search for the true meaning of Nashville hot chicken while in Nashville. I had eaten ""hot"" chicken and every single place the wife and I went to but was disappointed every time. Then it happened, Apple Maps guided me to Hattie B's. The wife and I were ordering from a wonderful young lady. I told her I wanted the hottest half chicken, the Cluckin Hot. Then I changed my mind because of the look she had on her face while she asked me ""are you sure?"". I decided to get the next to hottest (thank everything good in the world). We got our food and was putting it away when I noticed the college kid at the next table had gotten the Cluckin hot. It was great. He took two bites from his chicken and I could see the uh-oh on his face. He drained his cup and ate his sides in about 15 seconds but I could still see the desperation on his face. His friends (all 6 male and female mixed) noticed too. The guys at the table was telling him to man up and eat it since it wasn't going to be hot. The poor kid is sweating now. His friends keep pushing him until he disappeared into the restroom. To this day I don't know what happened to this poor kid cause he never came back before we left. Oh yeah, I could only eat half of my blackened chicken but it was great. My wife loved her chicken sandwich.",,
14lm47-DkG_D2Ebi2mjW8Q,,,"I was vacationing in New Orleans and I am so NOT the seafood eater. It was becoming harder each day to find some authentic food other than seafood. Our hotel referred us to Oceana & I tell you, I wanted to take the chef home with me. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the blackened chicken alfredo with broccoli & it was the best I'd ever had. Our server Errol was freaking amazing!!! He made sure we had plenty of drinks, let us taste our food before we ordered it, and kept us well entertained! Enjoyed all of the sfaff & the food. I will definitely recommend this restaurant."
14vrA4FwKqzcqoNt6MdXHg,"This is what Nashville Tennessee is known for! Seriously the best fried chicken I have ever tasted. Not joking. We decided to try this place out considering the reviews and the walking distance from our current location. (We ate fried chicken every day while in Tennessee but was not impressed until we ate at Hattie B's, (this says a lot.))


The line seemed daunting but decided to wait anyway- got to order about 45 mins later. I ordered dark meat plate with 3 sides! I wanted to taste a little bit of everything - potato salad, crinkle fries and the Mac & cheese. All were exceptional but I really enjoyed the potato salad, perfectly moist and great creamy flavoring. The fried chicken thigh was on a slice of bread with small slices of pickles. There are four levels of hot-ness and choose the 3rd level - ""HOT! Feel the heat!"", I like spicy so it was pretty mild (cayenne dry rub with a dash of habanero sauce) but nonetheless delicious still. The sauces that are on the table are very good as well- I liked the vinegar sauce with green peppers and maple syrup gave my plate extra kick of flavor. 

We finished our meal and the busser came by and asked us how our meal was and was very sweet. Would return again and well worth the wait!",,

I got the hot, and it was the right amount of heat.",,

The taste wasn't spectacular and the platters left much to be desired. The only & I mean ONLY reason I didn't complain is because I have had a few friends who worked there and the servers get fired over bad comment cards... So I left and excellent comment card because my server , Errol, he was great & very attentive. He's the only reason they got any stars from me.!"

Excellent price for the amount of food. I got a small dark meat combo with mac n cheese, fries, and banana pudding. I feel like all mac n cheese needs pimento in it after eating here. All the staff was helpful and attentive. I got the southern style chicken, and it was super juice... almost like butter. I think I'll try the spice flavors next time.",,

1696_GdChCzwHJs11mfjAw,"The best fried chicken I've had in Nashville. I'm usually into 'mild' heat, but I can definitely stomach the 'medium' here. The flavor is always satisfying and the sides are perfect portions. If you're sharing with a friend, get a large and split it. They'll even let you do two different 'flavors'. 
If you like banana pudding, you HAVE to try theirs. It comes with Nilla Wafers and it's oh-so-delicious. All of the side items are worth a try. 
For always being insanely busy, the staff always greets you and strikes up conversation while you wait. Even under pressure, they are nice and friendly.",,

What a great guy with endless stories to tell while shucking endless oysters..","Cool southern seafood vibe to this place.
Stopped in here on one of my visits to nola with a large group. The service was good and we were seated quickly.
The food was good but with so many places in nola im not sure I will ever be back for a second visit unless someone Im with wanted to check it out."

Everett was my server and he was great.The prickly pear margarita was super sweet but the alcohol hit me afterward. The seafood etoufee with crawfish tails was tasty and the chargrilled oysters was the star. I was stuffed and didn't eat most of my food. I had to pass on dessert. This place has big enough portions to share. I may return to try a po boy and bread pudding.

The food was so good I returned the next day and brought a friend. I had the chargrilled oysters and the boo fries. My friend had the seafood gumbo. OMG. So good.",

We came straight from the airport, luggage and all. We arrived around 2PM on a Thursday and the line was around the corner. They have a few fans and a cooler with small cups. Tip - bring your own water bottle so you can fill that up rather than going back and forth for a little cup.

Despite the long line we only waited 45 minutes.

I got medium chicken tenders, potato salad and pimento Mac n Cheese. I have NEVER had such juicy and moist chicken in my life and don't forget about the sides. I couldn't get enough.

My boyfriend got banana pudding for his dessert and although I've never had it (I know I'm crazy) it was utterly amazing. 

I would've went back and waited in line everyday, but wanted to give other restaurants a try.

Don't let the line deter you. It moves fast and your tummy will thank you.",,

18cv7auEg95fSX2sw_ar7Q,,"The wait was long but it was well worth it.  The Oysters were great, baked with cheese and garlic, or raw, we gobbled them up.  The atmosphere was packed and loud, but it was fun and lively, we quickly made friends with the folks at the next table.  The Gumbo and Red beans were good but not incredible.  For the overall experience and oysters I would give it 5 starts but the other options were too close to average.  I'll try some other places next time I'm in New Orleans but keep this place on your short list.",
18nyvAljoM2aJuuVB4FUSA,,"Food quality and service top notch. There is a wait (line outside of the door) but it is completely worth it.

Ordered 1 dozen raw oysters and 1 dozen chargrilled oysters. Both excellent. The raw were fresh and the chargrilled came out still sizzling in the shell.

The service is wonderful. We had one server assigned to our table, but we were able to ask anyone who walked by for service (some extra crackers for the table.) Also, everyone helped each other out. If there was an empty dish on the table, whoever was walking by would just pluck it right up.

The hush puppies alone are worth the wait in line. Red beans and rice  most everything we ordered was delicious. However the gumbo wasn't all that.

All in all, worth it. Soooooooo good. Definitely a place I would recommend.",

He didn't rush us at all but once we ordered everything came out quickly and was delicious.   I had the bloody Mary - spicy and good.  The crab cakes were fabulous.  When they brag about these, please believe them.  My husband had  the taste of New Orleans plate that had red beans & rice, jambalaya, etouffee, and sausage.  I had a fried seafood plate (oysters, cat fish, and shrimp) so we could share.  I immediately wished I had ordered the NO plate (mine was delicious and very fresh for fried food), it was perfect.  Great dinner!"

That's an official event in NOLA if you weren't aware.

Even if you don't like oysters you have to try one...even if it's covered in garlic/cheese/butter goodness",

The fresh oysters is what its about though! Sometimes there is a line, the trick is to not get suckered into getting drinks at the strip club bar right across the street. 

Drinks are good, their gravy fries are great drunk food and they are good with the sides and sauces. Make sure its someplace you stop by for food while in NoLa.",

We ordered one dark hot and one dark mild with a side of fries and macaroni and cheese to go, it was another 20 minute wait after we ordered to get our food. 
The mild was delicious with tender meat and great crunch. The hot was freaking hot but really good. There are two hotter options and I could not imagine trying them. The macaroni and cheese was on point and the fries were really good.

Naturally we arrived there bright and early ready for our second day of stuffing ourselves silly with fried delicacies. I ordered the Country Breakfast which consisted of eggs (poached for me), hash-browns, grits and toast. There was nothing particularly wrong with it but it was extremely average for the hype it received. The decor is gaudy and typical but the service (which I generally found throughout NOLA) was friendly and attentive. I wouldn't eat here again however, considering that the breakfast at my hotel was even better."
1B-RjyRgJats855ijCvzlg,"Hattie B's is a Nashville staple so we had to eat here on our trip. The line wasn't terrible - about a 15-20 minute wait at 3pm on a Tuesday. 

We ordered a 'damn hot' 1/2 bird, 2 'medium' chicken sandwiches and for the sides: coleslaw, baked beans, cheese grits and mac n cheese. My favorite sides are the grits & mac. 

The medium was a perfect spice level for me. I think I could have handle the heat from the 'hot'. Now the 'damn hot' spice level was PACKING! My Korean mother who can handle spicy food ranked it as a 7/10 on the Korean Scoville scale. 

All the food was great and we can't forget about dessert. Honestly, don't waste your time with the peach cobbler. The banana pudding was the best hands down. 
The comeback sauce & bleu cheese was a great addition to the sandwich as well.",,
1B44fH4EKzJU99bJOJwFeA,,"Do not let the line outside fool you.  This place is worth the wait even if it is hot outside and you don't have a cocktail in hand (yet!).

We told the hostess we would sit at the bar and that saved us probably 30 minutes of waiting in line.  We had to wait less than five minutes to be seated.  Once we sat down we ordered some raw oysters and two shrimp and oyster Po'boys.  The raw oysters were out in under two minutes and the sandwiches were out in less than ten.

I barely had time to finish my second Heineken before we were done eating.  Service was lightning fast and the food was superb.

Definitely recommend you sit at the bar instead of waiting on a table.  You will not be disappointed.",

She explained things and helped accommodate us so we had a wonderful time. We have only been in this state for a couple hours but I already feel that my trip has been fulfilled in the best way. Please show these employees that they help others to have happiness in these hard times. The other employees that I didn't get much of an interaction with were also wonderful as they showed my family kindness and genuine smiles.

1CAt182yUlX19iKcIfTEyg,"Not bad but not great. From a business perspective, it's perfect for being close to the university. It was busy but I got a seat. Some people had to stand around and vulture a seat as soon as someone else got up. It seemed they increase the level of hotness by increasing the amount of cayenne, rather than using different peppers for more or less heat. Damn Hot (2nd hottest) really just tasted like cayenne, no other flavors. Their fries are dusted, which I don't like, but that's a lesson learned. If you want 'em plain, order 'em that way. The mac and cheese was OK but not wow, and the coleslaw was neither sweet nor tangy; it just tasted like celery seed and black pepper. It's worth a stop if you're in the area and in the mood for hot chicken.",,

My BF had the New Orleans Medley with Boom Boom Shrimp and they were delicious. The wait wasn't too long either to get seated and the price was fair.","We went to Oceana on a Wednesday night and the wait was less than 15 minutes. They are so efficient and work as a team. 

For drinks we ordered the Hurricane and the tropical storm and they were both delicious. We were pleasantly surprised that they came flaming. For food we ordered the shrimp and fries and the blackened catfish meal, both were delicious. Overall a wonderful experience, I will definitely be back.

Also it's so friendly to a solo traveler like me. I feel so good when I was led by the server passing the long line composed by several groups of 2-6 people, just because there was one bar seat available at the moment：）

1FJegchJTGl5-Lbhrb0ahA,,"Second-best oyster house on Iberville. 

Having just discovered a few months ago that I actually love raw oysters, I was really excited to go to New Orleans and see what they had to offer. If you're on/around Bourbon St, Acme and Felix's are the two best-reviewed oyster houses and, having tried both, I have to give Acme a close second. 

The line at Acme was always longer than the line directly across the street for Felix's, so you're likely to wait between 45 mins and 2 hrs if you come with a party of four or more during dinner hours. That said, they let you take pitchers of beer outside, so it's not as bad as it sounds if you're committed to having good seafood.  

I'll base my ranking of Acme as the second-best oyster house on Iberville based on two dishes: chargrilled and raw oysters. The chargrilleds were a little overpowered by the parmesan cheese and the raw were too big for my taste (perhaps sacrilege to some, but although I love the flavor, I am a beginner).  One thing Acme did do much better than Felix's was beer--the draft selection was much larger and the Abita SOS is a great pilsner for washing down seafood. 

I also ate a pretty good (if standard) shrimp poboy, which had great fried shrimp and was made even better by the application of hot sauce (although I wish they offered something aside from Tobasco). 

Overall, a good meal, but not worth the wait with Felix's less than 200 ft away.",

I was in town for a little work and a little play and started to begin curating my list of restaurants to hit. Hattie B's was #1 because I had to see what the hype was all about. To be honest, I assumed that it would taste like other fried chicken I've had at other famous establishments like Roscoe's and Gus's, but I was wrong. The HYPE is REAL!!!

Hattie B's takes fried chicken to the next level offering multiple levels of spicy and delectable side dishes. I ordered the hot and my girlfriend ordered the medium. The hot was HOTTTTTT and the medium was HOT. They ain't messin' around here. Don't waste your time ordering the chicken tenders as they were kind of dry. Go for the bone-in!!! This is the holy grail of fried chicken!!",,
1FooNGnmhAhV4tYP7eZLxw,,"Wait outside on a Wednesday, wasn't long. Awesome service. Great raw oysters and reccomendation was on par. Had the Rockefeller soup and half fish poboy. Will eat again",
1G-3g2jzLyDvQzX3AFO2uA,"It was a good experience while in town. I had the hot chicken breast and a damn hot tender to eat. Both were good and plenty hot. The line was long, but it wasn't terrible. The staff was very nice and helpful.",,
1GbtKqRpDAfv13fUYIBBmA,,,"We stopped here because my friend saw a dish she had been wanting to try the last couple times she'd been in town. We sat in the enclosed/open air courtyard and it was very nice. Our waitress was Kimmy and she was great. She had no problem getting a new drink when the first was made with the wrong alcohol, and rushed my steak back as soon as she saw how under cooked it was. 
Other than those two issues everything was really good. My friend had her special dish, a red fish in a cream sauce, and thoroughly enjoyed it. 
Our Uber driver on the way to the airport was giving us a list of restaurants he recommends and this one kept coming up to the top of his list. I'll be back next time I'm walking down Bourbon Street and need a drink or some food."
1GdiDtrocL80ENy6mSUrvw,,"Be prepared to stand in line outside. But the good thing is that you are in the N.O. so you can enjoy an adult beverage outside while you wait in line. I will eat raw oysters but I am not a big fan, but my friend from the N.O. insisted I try the chargrilled oysters.

 Boy, the oysters were smothered in parmesan cheese and piping hot. An excellent dish. I also had the N.O. Medley, which included gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans and rice.  Excellent flavor and nice portions. Grabbed a to go box and finished two days later back home in Atlanta.

Simply delicious.",
1GnIzms3F3MJJK2kyIwuHQ,,"My ""out of town"" friends ALWAYS want to go here. It's great for groups because it's loud and they turn over tables fast. It's in the middle of all the action near Bourbon Street so tourist love that. I personally have had better food elsewhere but indulge my friends when they come to visit.",
1GszW68U9IJ88onltRjR5Q,"The line is long but the wait is worth it! This may be the best fried chicken I've ever had! Outstanding flavor, crunch and service! The Mac and Cheese is ridiculous and is a must try! Friendly servers that care about your fried chicken experience! Thanks for the military discount!",,
1GzyxttT_rbXj0uuDa8HIg,,,"Every enjoyable atmosphere, very good food, a wonderful server. The wait line was handled very well and quickly especially for a Saturday evening."
1H0HpIYo55z0fzvCiDxvwg,They need more help because trying to place a to go order for someone who is unable to get out and go eat they turn off all to go orders b/c they are too busy. Then when we arrive to place place a to go order the guy was like well I'm we aren't taking any b/c we are too busy. Well as a business that is part of it is to go orders if they can stay up to speed then they need more help or completely get rid of that service as an all together b/c the lack the skills of to go orders as well as dine in orders.,,
1HM81n6n4iPIFU5d2Lokhw,,"I've certainly noticed a decline over the years in the quality of the food here along with an increase in price (and the gumbo just doesn't seem worth ordering anymore to me).  Acme seems to have, unfortunately, earned the label of ""tourist trap"" for a reason but the oysters still seem to be consistently good and that should be the usual focus of a trip here.  The po boys or a fried seafood plate would also be a decent thing to sample in here.  The usual crazy lines at the French Quarter location make it a very rare thing that I will even attempt to eat oysters here as I hate lines but occasionally you can catch times without a line.  If there is a line I most often will be opting to eat raw oysters across the street at Felix's and I always prefer my grilled oysters at Drago's. 

If you've never been you probably should visit but to me it just usually isn't worth the wait or the cost.","I've always heard mixed reviews about this place with most being bad and so I've always been hesitant to try it.  Gorden Ramsay did a makeover of this place so I had hoped that would have improved the food but I continued to hear mixed reviews but not as many terrible ones.  This was one of the very few places open and the only place serving their full menu on the day after Hurricane Isaac landed so they get one extra star for that.  They also housed their staff above the restaurant during the storm so that also deserves credit for excellent planning. 

The tail end of Isaac was still blowing pretty good when a friend and I decided we needed a nice post storm meal and this seemed to be our only option for a nice dinner so we decided to try it.  When we first arrived there was a line of folks waiting to get in but we were able to get to the bar and enjoyed an island of normalcy amidst the chaos of the storm.  The service was very organized and efficient in dealing with the many people waiting to eat.  Unfortunately the area where they really underperformed was the most important area and that was their food.  The best way to describe this food is that it's like Copeland's but a lot less good.  My friend and I ate multiple things and none of the items really tasted good to us.  The BBQ shrimp were the most edible things served.  The seafood gumbo tasted funky, the redfish was not fresh and had zero flavor, and sadly the cheesecake was the absolute worst I've ever had.  My friend and I agreed that the fried seafood options would probably be the best thing to get here in the unlikely event we ever returned in the future.  

I really want to give this restaurant a good review as I'm very impressed with their superior planning and execution of their hurricane plan but the food really failed to deliver.  I would like to hope that the disappointing food was due to the chaos of the hurricane but they never lost power and they had a full staff so that would be a difficult argument to make.  I'm very thankful that they were open and I got to at least eat dinner as later in the afternoon I met a lot of folks that were hungry that weren't able to find anything to eat so the food here was definitely better than no food.  During normal circumstances and for the price there are much better quality experiences to be had all over the Quarter than this place but during a hurricane this might be your best bet."
1HbZJ9pHh0bve3OezM9TKA,,,"Was not happy at with Oceana Grill
Went there last Sunday after work, we order oyster Rockefella. Was very disappointed with dish."
1HtGcjZehXY8odctlBSIiQ,"Crack chicken. Line out the door. Okay, so, I got hot the first time and it was too much. Then I got medium and I could barely detect any spice! :/ Very frustrating. Consistency is important. The small dark is a leg attached to a thigh. Very hard to eat, but I managed. Tenders are easier, I might get that next time. White meat is a little better, I think. Yeah, my main issue is consistency. Each of the 3 times I've had Hattie B's, the chicken has been different. :0

The cold black eyed pea salad is my shit! Pimento Mac and cheese is also very good.",,
1I1pwzwhlO8v0Inh0x3Jbw,,"i came to this place because all the new orleans tourist books recommended it and seriously, this place really does live up to the expectations. good oysters!  

raw oysters - pretty good, fresh, big

chargrilled oysters - verryyy good! some parmesian cheese on top of fresh big oysters baked, with some sauce. 3 of us ordered 3 dozen, it was really satisfying, only way to go

po boy sandwich - an okay-good po boy, but not the best, and you wouldnt come here just to get the po boy either. tomato, fresh shrimp

oyster gumbo - disappointing. not many oysters, gumbo wasn't very thick",
1I7jDXlcRPIVu2ysUiPTng,,"Ok, ok, ok - do not let the outside fool ya - and DO NOT be intimidated by the line at the door - this place is some of the best food in all of New Orleans! Fresh, flavorful and out of this world - don't miss out on the raw and grilled oysters - oyster shots have a bit too much vodka (did I really say that?!?!) and the seafood platters are gonna hit the spot. Definitely get the hush puppies - and the cocktail sauce (hey - it's all in the details ) is the best in the city.",
1IQ08JJkEJR3iAJ40Ba6zg,So consistently delicious. You always get the heat level that you are expecting. Competitors must find some enjoyment in ignoring their customers. Hb's gets it right every time.,,
1IjWp2sWaAShlHc6Ze4URQ,,,The crab cakes were mostly breading and filler and were not very good.  My gumbo came out cold and I had to send it back.  Overall mediocre for the price.
1IkCIDX8acuo4PU8Qx0fVg,"Best chicken place ever! Every time I come to Nashville this is a must stop spot. Chicken is perfectly seasoned and their sides are unmatched. My favorites are the peach cobbler, Mac n cheese and baked beans! Do be prepared to wait in line outside to be seated but rest assured the wait is worth it!",,
1ImQBma2LYs4PKlXl4eAaw,should you get in the long line? should you not? It's a debate we all have. Husband and i waited for about 1 hour to taste this Nashville famous eatery. We have had fried chicken sandwich before in San Francisco and we didn't find this to be any better. We got the 'hot' but it wasn't as spicy as the 'medium' at some places.,,
1Iw2j54KfkveBZ2_HpTm2A,"Nashville Hot chicken time!!!  We went on a Monday around 5pm.  This seemed pretty perfect as the line was short (only about 12 people ahead of us).  By the time we ordered and was given our number in line (66) and sat down, less than 3 minutes later our food was at our table.  Quick service I tell ya!!!  Surprise surprise!!  I don't think this is standard from the waitresses response but everything worked in our favor that day!!!  I honestly don't have anything to add to the review accept I can agree and assure that what most  have declared is true : moist, well-seasoned chicken, sweet tea is phenomenal, greens were good (not my granny's but good) and the potato salad was ok (definitely could have eliminated the garnish all together and added a hint of salt). As a first timer and one who doesn't like spicy/hot food we opted to start at mild.  Next time, we will be a little more adventurous and try medium!!!!  Hint, hint...That means it's worth coming back!!!!",,

1JhdLyV1pWH_YLlO91IhNA,"The hot is no joke... it's seriously hot.  If you're a fan of uncomfortably spicy food, do it because it has a great flavor.  If not, go with the medium.  It's a great dry rub and you don't have to have a gallon of milk handy to get through it.  Enjoy!",,
1JhhKW8-mFWylSfBsb1_fg,,,"When you visit New Orleans, put this restaurant on your bucket list of things to try!  Trust me, you will not regret it.  My first meal was the grilled seafood (oysters, catfish, shrimp, hush puppies, and French fries) platter.  It was delicious, well seasoned and fresh.  John, our waiter, quickly served our drinks and appetizer.  Shortly after eating the appetizers, our meals arrived piping hot and good.  John frequently checked on us and refilled our drinks concluding a memorable experience.  As a matter of fact, we were so pleased that we came back the next day for breakfast and had seafood omelet with strawberry French toast and pleasantly pleased, again.  Although John wasn't our waiter, he ensured that we were well taken care of.  So, take a visit, sit in John's section and enjoy an experience like no other!!  On my next trip to NOLA, I will definitely eat here for many of my meals!  Thanks NOLA for a great weekend!"

I had the 2 piece large white medium breast and wings with extra pickles, pimento Mac n cheese (delicious) and beans. The chicken was perfectly breaded and sauced. If you like hot, skip the medium and amp it up",,
1KvMleuj3J1MCkcBtJEUrw,,Chargrilled oysters are the bomb! Also had fried crawfish po-boy and wife had shrimp po-boy. They were also very good. Friendly and professional staff kinda cramped space but that gives it a nice feel to me. We will be back. We went at about 4 so we didn't even have to wait in line. Oh almost forgot. Hush puppies were to die for a must order for a side.,
1LXgUfl1zZNaGsqDki1Xtg,,,Our experience at Ocean Grill was great. We loved the food. I went to visit for dinner with my wife and our 18 month old son. Our son doesn't normally like being in a crowded place but Our server Mary made sure we enjoy our dinner. This was the best customer service i had ever had. My son was crying the entire time and she made sure we enjoy our meal and tried to engage him and play with him despite she had to look over other tables she came every 60 seconds to make sure we are eating our meal and that our son is not crying. She was courteous from the heart and one can tell she was not just doing it . Very sincere. She also explained the dishes very well since it was our first time eating traditional new orleans food . She was very caring towards our little one and played with him to distract him from crying I will recomend oceana grill to all my friends just because of the service we got from  Mary and next time when we visit we will make sure we visit this place. We had a very good experience here the food was great especially the shrimp creole and bbq shrimp the ambience was awesome and the service was beyond 5 stars.
1Lq4zfAyrfy2P_m2HGcF0A,,,"Oceana is everything a restaurant wants to be. ""Good food in a great location"" When you have that you get to charge a little more. The key is ""a little more"".  Great southern preparations here are good, ie. appetizers such as crab cakes and oysters, but not elevated to be worth the 10 to 20 percent up charge that appears to be what they have done. 

The service, specialty drinks, and food quality all good but intimate and upscale it isn't, yet they charge like it is. It feels more ""casual tourist trap eatery"" and less like a fine New Orleans authentic dining experience. 

I do want to applaud their willingness to make sure the fish you buy is what your getting policy. Unfortunate counterfeit fish is a thing in New Orleans, but you just can't charge that much for it."
1M4qiS9h7cScMPFqNB_8mA,"If you're in Nashville you must try this place. There is usually a line out the door so be prepared to wait, however, it's worth it. We didn't feel like waiting so we went across the street to a sports bar, had a few beers and watched the line until it dwindled down. 

I tried the tenders with heat levels of Damn Hot and Shut the Cluck Up. The heat levels were pretty hot, but not too hot to eat. I like really hot food, so for the average person I would recommend medium. If you do decide to go with the damn hot or shut the cluck up, I recommend eating your sides first because the heat is so overwhelming it's hard to taste them after you've had a few bites of chicken. The sides I got were the pimento mac and cheese and the red skin potato salad which were both delish.",,
1MAZyXLLyNUoo7IyFBCQ6g,,,"One of my favorite places to eat when in NOLA.  The biscuits and gravy are a great start to the day.  I highly recommend the Cajun Fries.  It is hard to eat them and not be amazed!  They also have the best Crawfish Etouffée in the area. The helpful and polite servers and hostess are always glad you're there and happy to make your experience worth coming back time and time again.  
Good drinks. Great service.  Hot and delicious food."

I was surprised by it and it was warm and slimy under the hot crab cake.... I got the reason behind it but it didn't work for me the crab cake and sauce was the bomb alone..... i ordered the Redfish Ocean it was a sautéed redfish topped with the same sauce that was on the crab cakes... and I had roasted garlic potatoes with the sautéed greens... which kinda taste like glory greens in the can... (my greens taste better) but all in all the good was good and our server kaitlyn was cool!! I will definitely be coming back here!!!

They have a few tables and stools outside so I decided to sit on a stool and wait while my friend was placing our order, one of the employees here approached me to let me know that I was not allowed to sit until I already had my food, which I didn't mind, except that he was not very nice about it and tried to question me for sitting at a stool (not even a table) of an establishment where I was obviously a customer at.

He didn't give us refills on water...but that was one out of five times I have been there. 

The breakfast with Petunia's is really good- omeletes are really yummy!"

I got the fried chicken tenders since this is the only option without bones or dark meat. The chicken was definitely high quality and fully cooked. I ordered it medium spicy and would go one higher next time since I can handle spice and this wasn't enough for me! I recommend the honey on the chicken too which makes it even more savory. The baked beans were very very delicious but the Mac and cheese tasted like it was out of a box. I will try the fries instead next time. 

We say outside when it was about 40 degrees outside but there were heaters so it was quite comfortable. Also, we were there on a Friday evening and there was no line! This was also in the winter. Definitely check out if you are in town and you can even call ahead and get pick up!",,

Our waiter was very pleasant and told us about the specials. We ordered the gator bite for an appetizer which arrive in a very reasonable time. The entrees we ordered arrived shortly after and both our meals were beyond expectations. Our waiter was very attentive to our need and we left with a pleasant experience.

The Beans were creamy but also unmashed beans was among the sauce, swimming on top of a bed of white rice and flanked by a nice, big smoked sausage with just a little kick!  A couple slices of crusty bread and it was all good!

Service was overall friendly and efficient.

Amaazing oysters. They have 4 people just shucking oysters at the counter. It's fun to watch. Hundreds of oysters right in front of your eyes. We had the New Orleans seafood sampler as well. The gumbo was slightly fishier tasting than I'd like, but still good. The jambalaya and andouille were yummy with a slight spicy kick. Overall, good place for oysters! Yum.",

So... For the past 31 years, I have gotten banana pudding any time it is available at any restaurant, drive in, movie theater, family reunion, food truck, back sale, or curbside attraction. And each time, I have been left with a sense of disappointment and a feeling of ""my recipe is better"".... Until I had the banana pudding here. And omg... It's amazing. If the chef reads this... Or anyone that knows the recipe... Will you contact me? I want to trade recipes with you. The banana pudding is THAT good. There is a merangue added to the pudding... And the pudding tastes as though it is baked (not just dumped) and made from scratch. The banana pudding was so good, that nothing else matters.",,

The fresh oysters were excellent, some of the freshest I have had in NOLA.  Eat a lot of oysters, because after that the rest of the food is very predictable - deep fried everything.  I think next time I will have a couple of dozen raw oysters and call it a night!",

I figured that Acme must either be THAT good or a tourist trap.  Based on my one experience I'd say that the latter was likely the case.  We ordered a dozen raw oysters and a half dozen charbroiled.  Both were very good but definitely not the best I'd sampled during my week in nola.  For my entree I ordered the gumbo in a bread bowl.  Definitely not the best gumbo I had during my trip.  I may even go as far as to say it was the worst gumbo I've had, period.  As far as service goes, it was fair.  All in all I'd say that Acme is not worth the long wait.",

The guys behind the counter were on point from the fast service, truly professionals at shucking those oysters and having a good time while working.

There will always be a wait because of the popularity but I believe that it's well worth it! Their raw oysters are just delicious, served with cocktail sauce and some lemon. You really can't go wrong when they are so fresh. But the star of this place are the chargrilled oysters. The melty cheese and the garlic and the butter are just killer! Their other food is good, but I believe you can find better po boys and gumbo at other places. But I will come back for the oysters time and time again!",

The baked beans were very good, however, having ordered around closing time I apparently got the last of them so there was (black) scrapings from the pot in them (see photo). The Nashville Hot sandwich is juicy w/a nice crunch. The root beer float has the best vanilla bean tasting ice cream in it. The service was good! The place is rather small, I'd suggest take out. A wonderful surprise...the cup is given as a souvenir.",,
1TqssmkIgDBpa0k4XbJgSQ,,,"On our last day in New Orleans, we wanted to have our last fill of gumbo and jambalaya for brunch and found Oceana Grill on yelp and was really glad that we found this place before we left. 

They have a pretty extensive menu and Jessica our waitress was super friendly, came over and gave us an overview and provided great suggestions. 

Based on her suggestion, we both got the taste of New Orleans which was a plate of beans, jambalaya and etouffe, my wife was craving jambalaya and was able to order the same thing but only jambalaya. It was a huge plate of food, I think both of us could've shared one order and everything was tasty and excellent.

I've tried gumbo around various restaurants in the French Quarter in the last 5 days and really didn't really care for it until I came to Oceana Grill. Their gumbo was super flavorful, filled with rice and seafood, definitely changed my mind about gumbo. 

Definitely a great restaurant for great New Orleans food. I am so glad that we were able to visit before we left."

Raw oysters are always great but the chargrilled oysters were packed with so much flavor. I had the seafood ettouffe and that was good too. I forgot what my boyfriend had but basically a sampler of the gumbo and jambalaya. Overall we were really impressed with our meal and would recommend it to everyone","Ordered delivery. They forgot two of our meals and charged us the full amount. By the time we brought it back up to our hotel room and realized we were missing two items, it was 1am and they were closed. So we paid $65 for two items and a small pecan pie (not including tip). Really disappointed in their service. Will not be returning... there's so many other amazing food places in NOLA."

The taste of New Orleans was worth the price as we were able to try multiple amazing dishes in one. The gumbo was amazing with perfectly cooked rice. & then you have the pasta. You can taste every ingredient in every bite. 

The catfish on the seafood platter was the best part. Not a huge fan of the rest of the plate, but that catfish was worth it.

Definitely go here if you're in the French quarter area."

The seasoning is okay and a little spicy. But that's fine because I love hot wings but it's not for those with sensitive taste buds. I just cannot justify the long lines and wait times for this chicken. Please do not get me wrong, I really enjoyed the chicken and you will probably, too. I just cannot say, at this moment in time, this was worth it. I've had better chicken at this price point and the wait time was better. Regardless, I will probably be back.",,

They have a tangy black-eyed pea salad that I have not seen on the menu at any other chicken place.  The pimento mac and cheese is swoon-worthy.  The cole slaw has a pleasing zip of vinaigrette in addition to creamy, but not overly creamy, dressing.  The only side that I wouldn't recommend is the fries, which in my view are not worth the calories.9",,
1Vt3c4Bq3pxs6Puwa_f2uw,,,"Stopped by for lunch earlier around 2pm and it was fairly empty. Got seated in about 5 minutes and proceeded to look through our menu. Everything sounded really good but we ended up ordering a meal and a gumbo to share. 

1. Fried seafood platter (17.50$) - fried oysters, catfish, shrimp, jalapeño hush puppies, coleslaw, and comes with cocktail and tarter sauce. I mean, it's fried food, not much explaining to do but loved the catfish! Fries were also pretty good. 

2. Gumbo (9.50$)- ordered the bowl instead of cup because cup sounded like so little (6oz), both our first times having gumbo so it was an interesting experience. Soup with shrimp, rice and bread. It wasn't bad, but nothing to fan about. 

I've read through a lot of the reviews and it's a mixture of feelings but I personally feel the food isn't like amazing (or it's probably cuhs we got the fried stuff, but it was a recommended dish), but it wasn't anywhere near bad. The service was definitely up to par. Our server laquisha (apologize for the spelling), and she was super sweet. Took care of us from beginning to end! 

Also make sure to check in to yelp for 10% off!! :)"
1W1DwgLQKNdDFTepnbnKfg,"Thank goodness I checked yelp before going here. There was a line outside and normally I would have passed on the wait. Like another helper said though the line moves fast. 

Get the chicken sandwich but watch out for how much heat you add. If you're from Texas maybe you don't need this warning but a table next to me got the two hottest and the lady had to walk away (literally). I got it as medium and it was clicking fantastic. The crisp was good, the flavor was spot on, and it was a good size piece of chicken. 

Ok, the little white chicken was chicken. It was good but it wasn't wait in line and go out of your way delicious.  Get the sandwich eVen if you toss the bun.  I got it with all the toppings and I honestly thought it went together perfectly. 

Ok.... I wanted to get the peach cobbler. It was sold out!!  I was extremely saddened by this. I almost got the banana pudding but I have had some amazing banana pudding (see las Angeles reviews) before.  

If you get the peach cobbler, let me know what you thought of it. I read that it is great so I may have to stop again to try it.",,

Everytime we passed by, there was always a line, so we chose another restaurant instead. However, on our last day in NOLA, we knew we would have to tough it out and wait. For lunch around noon, it only took 20 minutes. We were seated at the oyster bar and promptly served our food. We ordered the piece po-boy which was topped with tabasco mayo and filled with oysters and shrimp. So delicious and on the most perfect po-boy bread imaginable. We also ordered the sampler plate that had seafood gumbo, andouille sausage and red beans and rice. Everything was flavorful and delicious.

The line is super long. I recorded a video the night we wanted to go and the line was too long. The next day as I was in line, it wasn't that bad. We didn't wait that long.They come and ask how many are in your party. As tables become available, they seat you. For example, if you are in a party of six and you are next in the door, but a party of 3 is behind you, it depends on what table opened up. If that table of 3 opened up first, the group second in line is going before you.

 Once our party was seated, our waitress came right over. She got our appetizers (crawfish and oysters) going and we ordered some po boys. The oysters were delicious and huge! Normally I can eat a few dozen, but here I could only put away 2 dozen. The peacemaker po boy was good as well. I got to have a shrimp and oyster po boy at the same time. The crawfish were well seasoned and they didn't last long at our table. The chargrilled oysters are tasty as well. I prefer the raw but hey you can't go wrong with either. A few things to know before you go:

- Everyone must be present in party before you are seated
- No split checks
- Only 2 forms of payment per check but not two cards (one card and the rest in cash)
- Prepare to wait
- Once party is called, move quickly
- If you are drinking outside, you can't bring it inside. Pour it out or gulp it down.
- Rudeness or just plain drunk can get you removed from establishment or even line outside (some of the things I seen geez)",

Yelpers agreed this place was awesome and it WAS, but I'm giving 4 stars because I ordered the catfish platter and while it was GOOD, I was expecting something more than what I could get in New York, and I HAVE had tastier, more flavorful catfish. Also I got the Swamp Tea, which came tasty and green, and smoking from the ice. 

My FRIEND however, who is a vegetarian, noticed that some vegetarian options she saw on the website weren't on the physical menu once inside Oceana. When she asked the waitress about this, she said even though it wasn't on the physical menu, she could still order. So she got the spinach ravioli and let me tell you how jealous I was.

When the waitress placed her bowl on the table, the smell instantly captivated me. The presentation was on point. This meatless ravioli looked like something out of a five-star Michelin-rated restaurant. I tried it myself and was blown away. I LOVE me some meat and seafood but if I could have snapped my fingers and traded in my catfish for her damn spinach ravioli, I would have. The herbs and spices, the freshness of the spinach, the SAUCE. My friend even commented ""seems a bit garlicky,"" BUT I LOVE GARLIC so this just made it even more appealing to me! 

I regret not getting that damn spinach ravioli, but you don't have to because you're going to do what I didn't."

It ended up being worth it because we had a good view of the street below. We had the crab cakes for an appetizer...way too bread-y and not enough crab. The sauce on it was good, but don't be fooled. A good crab cake can stand alone. I ordered the Fried Seafood Platter and ugh, the seafood wasn't seasoned like it should have been. The catfish could have been crispier and oysters were too greasy. The shrimp and fries were decent though. We decided to split the bread pudding for dessert and it was average. I was offended because the waiter brought me a dirty plate to put my portion on.

I would say that we got lucky with our spot!

I would recommend getting the combo. It's a way better deal. 

I also recommend getting their iced tea. Their sweet iced tea of course! It's free refills. I will mention that it does get pretty hectic in the small and crowded drink station. I was pushed by a few rushing fellow customers. I just waited my turn patiently... I wish others could do the same.

We ordered a dozen of the chargrilled and a dozen raw oysters. I would actually skip the raw oysters next time because although they were decently sized, they didn't have too much flavor or brine. Come for the chargrilled and chargrilled only! They are seasoned perfectly and topped with cheese. It also comes with a side of bread so you can soak up all that extra yummy oil on the plate. I'm drooling just thinking about it. They were so good we had to order another dozen after we finished the first! 

We came for oysters and crawfish only but unfortunately they didn't have any crawfish because they are currently not in season. We also ordered a Hurricane and a Bloody Mary to drink and both were DELICIOUS. Probably the best drinks I had in New Orleans and we had a decent number of both at several places.

Let me tell you when I say there's a crowd that lines up to get in.  To me ... it's all about the gator bites!  Best thing ever especially the blackened.  Our first visit yes (we went more that once ... seriously that good) we got the fried/blackened! The other two times just blackened! 
I was super excited at the thought of my potentially traveling to NO next month for work but with the Omnicron spreading like wildfire the trip sadly isn't likely to happen.

NW oysters beat the living crap out of LA oysters in taste, texture, freshness, you name it.  So if you are fond of NW oysters, go here knowing you will get a different animal.

That being said, the oysters were good and fresh...try both the BBQ and half shell.  They're both very good.  My soft shell crab po' boy was GREAT.    Although, they need a grilled shrimp po' boy or something...every option seemed to be fried.  Which is fine, but I already am starting to look like Bubba The Greasy Shirted Truck Drivin' Deer Huntin' Fatass Redneck.  I need to return to my semi-svelte snobby wine sippin' California self.

1bDE0ag3UHui1J0rAZBymQ,"Hattie B's was truly one of the highlights of my visit to Nashville. Was wanting to go to Bolton's, Prince's or a Hattie B's. This restaurant was just closest to my hotel. The fried chicken, by itself, is amazing. Hot (temperature), moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. But then dipping it in the sauce makes it so much better. I had Medium sauce. Medium was warm on my lips, so maybe coulda gone with Hot. The greens and black eyed pea salad were both spot on. And was nice that they had s good selection of beers on tap. Went on a Monday around 5:00pm and the wait was around 30 minutes.",,

Finally on our last night, we knew there was no other choice than to stay in that line.

It was worth it!  Crawfish and the Jambalaya alone was worth the 40 minute or so wait!  The Charbroiled Oysters would have been worth waiting even longer!

We had the grilled oysters, fried crab claws, the peacemaker poboy, the roast beef po boy, shrimp and crab gumbo and the bananas foster cheese cake.

The homemade tarter sauce and cocktail sauce was the best I have ever tried, I need to figure out their recipe.  We ordered a half plate of raw oysters, huge and abundant.  Then some fried fish, shrimp and oyster with fries, the breading was thick and crunchy, out of this world.

I ordered the 20oz steak paired with collard greens and garlic mashed potatoes. The potatoes were great. The greens weren't really seasoned to well and were kind of bland. The steak was cooked very nicely BUT the dry rub was a bit much. I was almost like it wasnt used to SEASON it but to COAT it and I ended up scraping alot of it off. I MAY BE WRONG, but upon my visit in July, I thought they served a bread and butter while you wait for entrees but that wasnt the case on this visit. ONCE AGAIN... I may have the restaurants mixed up. OVERALL, I enjoyed the meal and would definitely visit again.

I don't care if u are a fan of Hattie B or the original Prince's hot chicken, just go get them whenever u can.

There was a pretty long line, but I sent my sister and mom to get us cocktails elsewhere and we waiting in line while sipping our drinks, and it made the wait not so bad. The host was a super nice young guy, who walks through the line taking names and party size. The line seemed to move at a decent pace, and we were able to cut a few people ahead of us because we were willing to sit at the bar. Dude, next time I come here, I will specifically request the bar, because watching all that shucking, and being able to chat up the bartender (who is also our server) was hella fun. He was super cool, as was everyone behind the bar. Those people do NOT stop moving. They bust ass! The entire staff that I encountered were actually all really nice. I loved that. 

We started with the chargrilled oysters, and they pretty much changed my life. First of all, if you didn't know, (I didn't) oysters in New Orleans are so freakin big! They were kind of intimidating. The chargrilled ones are served hot (duh) covered in some buttery sauce with cheese... holy mother of whoever you worship... I wanted to shove a dozen in my face. And then maybe a dozen more. And dipping the crusty bread they serve in that butter sauce... AGHHHH (insert crying emoji here). My sister and I ordered oyster shooters (oysters in a shot of vodka) and that was fun. Definitely for the more adventurous. We also ordered the boom boom shrimp, which were deep fried and covered in some sauce that made me feel glad to be alive. lol. I had the oyster and shrimp po boy for my entree. It was really good, but there's a lot of bread there. I feel like too much bread drowns out the taste of the seafood, so I kind of ate it open face. Sorry. I really liked it though. 

I will absolutely be back the next time I visit New Orleans, line be damned!",

It was to my surprise that we did not have to wait in line at all this morning. We showed up at around 11, and luckily, we were sat right away. To keep our stomach ready for some tea time brunch later, we only ordered 2 dozens of the chargrilled oysters and the fried seafood platter. 

The oysters were still as good as they were! I loved the parmesan topping on the oysters so much, and the butter was sooo good. My only complain is that the oysters were still very gritty like I have had previously. Not sure if it's because it's not being cleaned properly or not, but I had no such problem at another establishment.

Otherwise, the fried seafood platter was great. The coating was perfect, not too much, not too little. The fish tasted very fresh, and the hushpuppies side was a sweet little kick!",

The interior is almost like a bar with bright fluorescents signs and lots of xmas lights! The atmosphere is loud and exciting, drawing you into the cool frenzy of French Quarters. We came right before prime dinner time so we only had to wait ten minutes!

Half dozen of oysters: UGH, so fresh!!! I mean what do you expect?!
Fried oysters: Again, freakin' delish! They put a lot of butter on it too
Gumbo: Very interesting flavor, and like my previous New Orleans post, this one was super salty too. Verdict? I think my Cali palette isn't used to what gumbo is really supposed to taste like!
PoBoy with Shrimp and Oyster: LOVED the crispiness of the shrimp and oyster...put that in a sandwich and I'm sold!

They have a good amount of seating, some are community tables where we had to share a long table with another party. Service was super friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great seafood!",

Problem is there's a section of the line outside where it smells like overnight puke - probably due to the horrible mixture of sewerage water and garbage.   

Service is decent - our waitress refill our drinks and she's pretty friendly.  

Food , like mention before the oyster is good!  Sad thing is - that's all!!!   We were suckered since the oysters came first we though everything was just as good.  HOLY crap were we wrong.  They did a complete bait and switch.  Everything else wasn't up to par.  Just get yourself a plate of oysters and leave!",

This is the place to check out when in NOLA!!!!

Line was out the door. I thought it would be an hour long wait by looking at the line. Talked to the organized host and he said he could seat 2 (keep in mind we were willing to eat at the bar or table) within 8-10mins.  I told him I called him bluff.  Sure enough we were sitting within 8mins. 

We were seated at the bar in front of our server/chef. It was entertaining to see him work his magic. He could interact while cracking and preparing the oysters.  

We decided to try their flavorful, buttery, parmesan chard fired oysters, gumbo and oyster shooters.  Whether you had an oyster shooter before or not, you have to try Acme's. Highly recommend joining the club ;-P

It appears to be a hole in the wall, but it's worth the wait and the price for the great company, service and food.

1hN28hzNBt9qUOIgDOMkwg,,,"There are SO many great things to say about Oceana Grill, so let me list them out for you:

Hostess - Amazingly wonderful! She was super accommodating and sweet and made sure we were seated comfortably.

Service - Our waiter Damon was so sweet and hardworking and made my friend's birthday lunch there extra special with his gift and bday serenade. He should be made a permanent waiter there, STAT! Josh, the bartender, also made the drinks strong but very tasty. 

Food - My goodness... The food was sensationallllllllllllllllllllll! All those L's were necessary because it was THAT delightful! The crab cakes were delectable. The creamy sauce it came with was perfection. The alligator bites were also wonderful and an awesome way to start the meal. For my entree, I got the St. Francis crepes that consisted of crawfish, veggies, and an amazing sauce. Even when I warmed up the leftovers the next day they tasted divine. The birthday bread pudding that was brought out also a SUPERB dessert. The rum sauce on it was so tastyyyy.

Overall, the next time I touch down in NOLA, Oceana will be my first food stop. You really cannot go wrong dining there!"
1hQjdoDUQwHB3kFdffMA6Q,"Delicious!  Probably my favorite meal I had during a recent trip to Nashville.

So here's the scoop from a tourist's perspective-- there is a line to order your food.  We waited 20 mins on a Thursday night around 6 pm.  They bring out your food to you when its ready.  Seating is on a covered deck outside and there are a few tables inside as well.  

My husband and I both got the 3-tender meal.  The spice levels range from no heat(""Southern"") to very hot (""Shut the Cluck Up"").  My husband went with the ""Hot!"" while I tried the second spiciest option ""Damn Hot"".  

Damn Hot was too damn hot for me--- I handle spice pretty well (or at least I thought) and I had a hard time getting the chicken down.  That being said, it was still really delicious chicken.  Also, the sides were super tasty- we went with fries, collards, baked beans, and red skin potato salad.  The potato salad was my favorite and collards were a miss-- a bit too bland for my liking.  All of this food, and a couple of waters, was about $20.  Not bad for a decent sized meal.

My advice to a tourist would be go with either Hot!  or Medium spice level.  In my opinion, if a dish isn't spicy enough, it's not the end of the world, but too spicy can ruin your meal.  Try as many sides as you can.  And go during an off-time if you don't want to wait.",,
1hfT9aEW_6jGmf2lmMCRPQ,,"Chargrilled oysters were pretty good, though I still prefer Drago. The onion rings were amazing!I also had a Caesar salad with fried shrimp that was very good as well.",
1i4YvXLh5c-z7ayYlAUOJw,"I'm a believer in Nashville hot chicken thanks to Hattie B's. Thanks to the local advice from a buddy (who's local), I ordered online and beat the massive line that was piled out in front. We went in through the side door and waited for our order to get called up. Our food was ready a couple minutes after the scheduled time. Nothing to complain about really. Something to note: Despite being crazy busy, the staff was still courteous and friendly. Being from South Florida, I would've expected employees to be standoffish and/or just plain rude. It's refreshing to see the script flipped.

The chicken was crispy, yet juicy. Served piping hot. I ordered my chicken with medium heat. It turned out to be the right amount of heat for me. I highly recommend Hattie B's for anyone visiting!",,
1iDskWUBBRIql6EsYzCHWw,,,I had the fried catfish platter with fries and hushpuppies. The fish was light and tasty.  Not too much batter masking the fish.  Really tasty.  The fries and hushpuppies were excellent too. We had the chargrilled oysters for an appetizer. The parmesan sauce was great.  The only negative would be the hostess having to ask us four times how many people were in our party when we walked in and then telling us to wait outside.  Came across kinda rude.
1iM9I1JzpjuSdCy3m6CI-w,,,"Overall the food is delicious we had the catfish, hush puppies, red beans and rice. The stand out for me was the red beans and rice, literally the best I've ever had"
1iMtOlXd7BRaCDejF1wZIA,"*sigh* ok so this was the second time trying Hattie Bs. Yes it's the classic and famous one, but I don't think it's the best one in Nashville. We did a tasting of chicken tenders from mild to shut the cluck up. It's a steady burn that increases over time and definitely not the best feeling a few hours later. The chicken itself was a bit disappointing though. Yes it was hot fried chicken, but seriously lacking in flavor, just had heat. The sides were all similarly disappointing.",,"Overall good food. 
Shrimp appetizer in a pepper sauce was some of the best flavored shrimp I've ever had. Delicious and good size.
Chicken po'boy was ok - good flavors but not enough of the slaw for that much bread and the chicken wasn't too flavorful. 
Also got the veggie stew, which was flavorful"

Do yourself a favor and order a dozen or two -- you'll hate yourself forever if you only get 6, and everything you eat for the rest of the night is gonna taste like ash after this amazing FLAVOR experience.  I went with the Peace Maker for the main meal -- it was okay but didn't hold a candle to what came before.  

As for the line -- we showed up around 5:45 on a Weds night and it was halfway to the street corner.  Don't be too intimidated though.  A hostess with a clipboard was walking the line and assured us it wouldn't be much more than 30-40 minutes to get in.

Acme does it right with a variety of sauces if you'd like but the oysters are phenomenal even without condiments. The po boys are big and appetizers flavorful. But my favorite are the chargrilled oysters which are hard to find in California. Get there early cause it gets packed but a definite must stop oyster bar if your visiting the big easy.,

We started off with Raw Oysters which were some of the best I've had. My husband had the Chargrilled Oysters which were to die for! They are an absolute must! I had the Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy which, I must say again, was the best Po-Boy I've had (so far) in NO.

We touched down in New Orleans from California around 8 o'clock at night, and this was the first place we went to after dropping our bags off at the hotel. We ordered 3 dozen of the grilled oysters, a couple fried platters, and some bang bang shrimp. The wait was less than an hour on a Thursday night. It's a no frills, dive type place, but the food speaks for itself. I still think about their grilled oysters to this day; nothing compares here in the Bay Area. Definitely recommend adding this to your bookmarks when visiting the French Quarter.",

They have some of the best huge fried dishes that you can get. I love to get the fried oyster and shrimp poboys. My parents always get 2 dozen raw oysters. They also have char grilled ones that are sinfully amazing, when you walk in you can smell them. Probably the worst thing about Acme is how busy they are. If you cant stand the line they also have a location in Harrahs.",

White, dark, fingers, wings are all great. I usually get one southern style (non spicy) and one medium. I had the shut the cluck up (their spiciest) once, only had one bite, and got full real quick....from all the sweet tea, water, and milk I drank to get rid of the pain. If you eat with your hands, don't touch your face!

1kH1j9AXVXiI-sBc286ttw,,Acme beyond satisfied my expectations. Definitely a place that stays busy with a line down the block but once you're seated the experience begins. The charbroiled oysters are pretty much one of the best things I've ever eat in my life and I've been a professional chef for the past 12 years of my life. I had the fried seafood platter oyster shrimp and fish they were all pretty good. Prices aren't crazy but you may be tempted to order another round of oysters once you try them. Overall extremely satisfied I wish we had this place in Miami. The only negative is the spicy cocktail and so so tartar sauce but that's irrelevant.,
1kiUxDzPYqVmyhWYW4N9rg,,,"After a shitty meal yesterday at Court of the Two Sisters we headed over this morning (Labor Day) for breakfast on the recommendation of the front desk at our Hotel to Oceanagrill. Stepped inside to a friendly front desk check in. No reservations no problem. Wife opted for outside courtyard seating. They put us in the back at what I would say is the best table in the house. 

I digress a second - Unlike Court of the Two Sisters who packed in customers side by side and filled the place up to capacity, Oceanagrill followed ""Strict"" Social Distancing guidelines and made sure that not only was the restaurant very sterilized and clean in smell and appearance, but all customers were overly distance from each other. 

Back to the review. We sat down at a clean table and had immediate and may I say Excellent service throughout our meal from waiter Jamal. The menu for breakfast has it all. My wife ordered poached eggs over biscuits with sausage which comes with what I can solidly say are the best grits and home fries I have ever had. She also ordered a small side of Sausage Gravy. I had 2 eggs over easy and an alligator and andouille sausage. It came with a biscuit drizzled with honey over it and their grits and home fries. Everything was outstanding and again the service was spot on! Did I mention that I drink my coffee Black and theirs is strong and delicious; never-ending refills from Jamal.

I highly recommend this place for Breakfast or Brunch! Thank you Oceanagrill for making our second meal in NOLA feel like we were back in the Big Easy!"

Not to be eaten. I gave them back and waited for my bbq shrimp, to get another dissapointment, bad seasoned, it didnt taste fresh either and you get just two little pieces of bread to dip into yr shrimp bbq, no lime, it was kinda gross anyways, i just had a couple of the shrimps.

This being said, Go to Acme, Deanies, and Felix's oysters, they will have much better food than his, i just came here bcs it was the only place opened, and i guess they used to be good at some point, thats what my friend that works at a club in front says."

1mR4TuK67rBo2Bo5j3u-rw,,,"For a place that looks a lot like a T.G.I. Friday's, this place wasn't too bad. It is a massive space stretched through a number of FQ buildings. The interior vibe is touristy, and the overly eager seems to reflect that (although this might be my Northeastern cynicism. 

In any case, we ordered two relatively expensive dishes. My girlfriend got some tuna etouffee, and I ordered the blackened red fish. Her fish was high quality and the etouffee part was pretty tasty. My blackened redfish was similarly good, though I wasn't wowed entirely by either dish. The amount of food for $22 was probably adequate. The sides that I got with mine, like the jambalaya, were pretty tasty. 

I am sure that there is better Creole food out there in New Orleans, but this place seems to do the trick nicely. Plus, the servers were very nice and made sure that we had everything that we wanted."

First Order: Oyster shooters. Didn't go down as smooth as I wanted it to and I definitely tasted better. The oyster tasted very fresh though. The additional seasonings did not blend well. 

Second Order: We got the original charbroiled and half a dozen raw. Compared to Dragos charbroiled it felt less flavorful but it was good enough for me to come back a second time. The raw oysters were nothing special as I have tasted similar out here in DC.",
1nIBLHNK8_9jLxA40E91gg,"Amazing!!! My best meal in Nashville. Worth the wait to order, line moves well. Just please remember to ""shut the cluckin door""!!
Chicken was great, skin crispy and meat moist. Had the medium heat and it was just right. The sides are awesome. Mac N Cheese creamy and lots of flavor. We are still arguing with what made the beans sweet, we couldn't figure it out but we loved them. My favorite was the greens, don't think I have had before and I'm mad that I've been missing them. Make sure to leave room for the banana pudding, it's a southern staple and they do it well. 

Service is quick and friendly. Just pay attention when you're ordering and stay off your phone for 2 minutes they are trying to take your order. They bring food out to you and continually ask if you need anything. Once served, you can order add-ons from staff on floor without having to stand in line. Great service!!

The oysters were large and clean.  They have soft shell crab platter for $17 (comes with fries and 1 side).

1qOCnZqMyqcSCR0RRHYTJA,"Add me to the long list below of Hattie B's hot chicken fans.  With the exception of the one-star review (which was probably written by a guy who was dumped by the owner's daughter) most of the reviews tell you what you need to know about Hattie B's.  

If it were for the hot chicken alone, my review would be five stars.  Unfortunately, the sides I had (potato salad and cole slaw) were pretty ordinary and not very flavorful.  But honestly, the chicken was so good I didn't really care about that. 

I ordered the medium-heat tenders.  Heat-wise they compare with other places' hot.  The medium is probably just about right for most hot chicken fans.  I can't even imagine how scorching the shut-the-cluck-up is (notwithstanding William W.'s probably fake review saying it was like other places' mild).  I've had Prince's, Scoreboard, and 400 Degrees.  I'd say this medium compares to the second-to-hottest level at Prince's and Scoreboard, and about the 200-degree level at 400 Degrees.  

Even though I got the medium this time and really liked it, I might try the hot next time so I can compare the two.  But I think the medium probably strikes the right balance of spicy heat and other flavors without the heat being overwhelming. 

Although the sides were portioned a bit small, the chicken tenders were surprisingly plump.  There was a lot of meat there and it was cooked just right, juicy and fresh out of the fryer.  Definitely a good value for the price.",,

After 30 minutes of 80 degree sun and humidity, car exhaust and screeching cars racing just several feet from us, we had to reevaluate how much we wanted to eat there.

First thing that hits you once making it through the door is an indescribable smell...like bleach mixed with chemically cleaning supplies, moldy beer & nasty bar bathrooms? You don't smell any food which I thought was rather weird. But maybe it's because you wait in line right in front of the bathrooms...gross.  
Anyway the chicken was too thick to be tender had zero flavor & was greasy, salty and rubbery.  I was told that hot chicken here is super hot and that you need to order down so I got medium which = zero heat & zero flavor for me even after soaking it with the hot sauce at the table this was not edible.  The fries were coated with too much seasoning salt, baked beans tasted like canned & were too sweet, mac & cheese was served luke warm and had no taste...I like to see some real cheese in there not just a cheese sauce....boring. 
Basically we took a few bites and tossed the rest right in the garbage where it belonged I hate to waste food but we just couldn't eat this.  Sorry to be such a negative Nancy but this was no good.  
On a positive note if you're ever in Chicago stop by Do-Rite Donuts & Chicken now that is how a chicken sandwich & tenders should taste they do it right haha!  Make sure to add the hot sauce they have on the side of you like heat.  And of course don't leave without some donuts they are bomb too get the old fashioned!!!",,

Best fried chicken ever. 
2 ppl should get the large white and they will split it up for you - it's a great value and you can add on sides for $.50. 
You can mix and match heat levels as well.
I had the mild and it was perfect. Tried a medium tender, if you are on a date may want to go with the tenders cause they are easier to eat ;-) they are delish.
Medium is too spicy for a full meal IMO.
Honey mustard is solid.
Sides: southern greens are yummy, but might be too salty for some - they also have a kick.
Cole slaw is more savory than sweet.
Heard the potato salad is a must, will get that next time.

Love the serve yourself tea so you can mix sweet and unsweet / lemonade to your own preference.",,

1sMZdqmCa_X2Lf_x6XOCFw,"While there are few things I dislike more than waiting in a line for food, on my 2nd trip to Nashville, I finally had to make hot chicken a reality.

We arrived early in the evening, and the line wasn't too bad, no more than about 4-5 people outside. Unfortunately, I had to drive around and find semi-reasonable parking. $8 for one hour was the best I could find. Of course, by this time the line had ballooned out to the sidewalk and around the restaurant. Groan. Two dudes immediately behind us in line who reeked of booze and were chainsmoking cigarettes made this one of the most unpleasant lines I've stood in, in recent memory. We ended up standing out there for about 30 minutes. A long 30 minutes, it was.

Finally, I ordered. While in line, I thought about this....should I go for a more typical ""hot"" in my hot chicken, or should I do the ""shut the cluck up"" level hot? I do have the ability to handle (and even enjoy) a pretty high level of heat...Scoville units don't much faze me. Since this was my first time at HBs and I didn't know when I'd be returning to Nashville, I went for it.

The first bite or so, though quite hot, was enjoyable. Beyond that, though, I have to say, the Cluck was a slog of an eating experience, even for me. The heat was intense, just heat for the sake of heat without imparting any additional flavor. I mitigated it a little by scraping off much of the skin where most of the pain resided, but even then, too much of the heat had made it into the meat itself. 

The routine went like this....eat a bite, mouth on fire and all teary eyed, guzzle half a cup of lemonade, wait for the pain to subside a little, take another bite. It took me about 40 minutes to eat all the meat off 2 chicken breasts in this manner. I also had collard greens and baked beans, neither of which I could fully enjoy due to the pervasive inferno in my mouth that was informing everything I tried to eat. 

If I ever do this again, I'll go a couple notches down on the heat scale. I did try a few bites of significantly less hot fried chicken before I decided to rake myself over the coals, and it was quite tasty. I'd come back, with the Cluck far, far behind in the rear view mirror. I'm telling you, don't do it, even if you love heat. It's stupid-hot to the level of pointless absurdity...you might as well crush habanero peppers in a bowl and start spooning them down. That would be a similar level of heat.

For what it's worth, I was told by a fellow diner that Prince's is even hotter. To that, I just have to ask, why?",,
1seaXFGTAmH9x7T3zipdZA,,"I was in NOLA for the Jazz Festival and heard about Acme Oyster house. I wasn't a big fan of Pacific Oysters but decided to give it shot anyhow. The line to get in was ridiculously long - I think we waited for over an hour (maybe 2....) for a seat at the bar. So we stood on the sidewalk and took turns refilling our daiquiris from the bar down the street and people watched. Let me just say, even if we had to stand in the snow in the middle of winter (with no daiquiris), I would wait to eat here again anytime. Everything I had was delicious - the charbroiled oysters  = heaven. Make the time to eat here and try new things and you won't be disappointed!",
1sghNitdObSPFhxqS5Othg,"Amazing delicious chicken that definitely delivers flavor! They have different levels of heat, and I chose the hot to be on the safe side. You can tell how spicy everyone's chicken was by the level of red it was. The hottest ones were nearly fire engine red, and the regular wings/tenders/breasts were the traditional brown of fried chicken. There is always a line to get in, and less seating than you'd expect--the place is SMALL. Its definitely worth navigating the area to get to.

The winner of this place has to be the greens. They were outstanding and I nearly inhaled them.",,

He is really a wonderful man and Acme is lucky to have him.  He talked with us throughout our entire meal while he shucked countless oysters  We ordered a couple dozen oysters, some fresh some broiled with cheese.  Unbelievably good.  I loved the broiled oysters.  I also got red beans and rice with Andouille.  I couldn't come to NOLA and not get some Andouille.  Every thing was tasty and the service from Norman was top notch.",

You know the food here is good when there is a line before it even opens.  Make sure to go early or else you will be waiting an hour.  Luckily my wait was only about 15 minutes.

All of the workers inside seemed to love there job.  They were singing and dancing while helping us.  The atmosphere of the place set the stage for a great meal.

I went with the small white which was a leg and a breast.  As sides I had the mac and cheese, fries and potato salad.  Everything was perfect.  The mac and cheese was probably my favorite side.  The chicken was easily the best fried chicken I have ever had.  I chose to only get mild sauce, but it was still spicy.  The flavor was perfect.  Every bite was juicy and tasted incredible.

The platters are really big, come with your choice of side + fries.

I sat near the register with a birds eye view of the entire place and took it all in. Staff was friendly and efficient. They were constantly wiping down everything - there were bottles of hand sanitizer etc around and (as a total germ weirdo) I felt very comfortable that they had the cleanliness in check.

1vdoueB6GDGQk5IGOiFXmQ,"The hot chicken sandwich is one of my favorite food items in the world, and the chicken tenders are equally tasty.  I am very spicy-heat tolerant, and generally go with the Damn Hot though occasionally have the Shut the Cluck Up.  I find the difference in heat level between the two to be fairly marginal, whereas there is a big drop off in heat level from the Damn Hot to the Hot.  

In addition to the hot chicken, I love many of the side dishes and usually have to add a third to my order.  If I had to rank, I'd say the black-eyed pea salad is my fave, followed closely by the baked beans, southern greens, cole slaw, and potato salad.  The cold sides, esp. the potato salad and cole slaw, offer a refreshing complement to the heat of the chicken.

Once you got in the service was very good and the chicken was as well. The Mac and cheese was probably the star of the show for me. Creamy with some spice and the noodles were the correct consistency. 

I doubt if we would ever go back. A lot of places have hot chicken and I would like to try some others. I think the expirience was worth the wait, but now that we checked that box, we will try some other places that do not make you wait in the rain for a couple chicken thighs.",,

However, that's a good thing in this case because the turnover means the food is always fresh, important considering their specialty is oysters. Going in groups can be a disadvantage at this place, since space is limited and they seat individuals and small parties quicker.

The service here is consistently fast and friendly. Since their goal is to clear the tables quick for the next customers, the food comes out fast as well. Aside from the raw oysters, expect a lot of deep fried items on the menu, but most of the items I have tried turned out to be good. Acme Oyster House serves Pepsi products.

They have an extensive menu of many creole and cajun favorites, but it was no contest for me, from the moment the tour guide mentioned his favorite dish, the blackened redfish etouffee I knew that was the dish for me.    Wow!  This dish was spicy and flavorful, a perfect combination of the spicy blackened redfish and the creamy crawfish etouffee.  

It also came with jambalaya which was also packed with flavor and was very tasty.  The sauteed mustard greens were surprisingly enjoyable as well.  I only didn't finish them because I was stuffed and of all of the parts of the meal was the least impressive, but don't let that fool you, they were a great veggie side! 

The place has a great vibe, and like many spots in New Orleans, a hidden outdoor patio in the courtyard inside.  While the weather was nice enough for us to enjoy the outdoors, their busyness did not allow for it on this trip.  We went on a weekend at lunch, and there was a decent line to get in and get a table so plan accordingly especially if you are a bigger group.  

The staff was super friendly and personable.  We were in town for the Bills game and were still wearing our Bills gear after a fun win on Thanskgiving, the staff were happy to chat about the Bills and the game in a fun and friendly way.

Like many tourists I too was floored the first time. But with each return, it's never as good as in the beginning. 

For everyone else: The first time is always the most exciting. This will be the longest line you wait in for food amongst the top tourist sites (aside from Cafe Du Monde). The line may go quickly. Once the heat is on(late morning), people will start falling off to go elsewhere. Get a drink and stay in line, you'll be in there soon.
Try to check them out with a clean stomach. Get some fried goodness or a po'boy and skip the rest with a clear conscience. There are plenty of other venues to have good dessert, gumbo or appetizers.",

We started out with the soup of the day- a very creamy corn crab chowder- I could have eaten another bowl but wanted to save room for other stuff. We knew we had to order oysters-- duh-- and our server recommended the chargrilled variety.  We had 1/2 dozen and for me they were overpowered by the parmesan and garlic-- I felt like I was eating seafood linguine without the linguine.  So we ordered a dozen raw- they were very fresh; delicate flavor-definitely preferred these- guess I'm a purist.

We also had a dish of red beans & rice- not bad- very filling. The sausage is served on the side-- would recommend cutting it up and mixing in to get more flavor.

Great oysters, etc. etc. We walked over, and saw neon signs inside, heard loud music on the sound system, and figured it must be a tourist trap, some kind of South Coast Hard Rock Cafe. When our alternative turned out to be closed, we went back. Boy was that a good move.

The oysters here are just incredible. I know oysters are oysters, but here they're briny-fresh from a local farm, shucked perfectly, and come with a spicy/tangy cocktail sauce that I wanted to eat by itself after the oysters were long gone. Toss in a light, crispy catfish sandwich, friendly, knowledgeable service, and I'm permanently sold.

It was simple fare, but it was done so, so well, and it didn't cost a whole lot neither.",

The guy kept saying he was in front of our hotel, he was not -I was outside in the rain looking for him. This lie went on for 30+ minutes. Male manager hung up on me a few times when I called and asked for a refund or credit or to connect me with the delivery guy. The female general manager finally was put on and was helpful though she questioned if we were indeed outside first. She said she'd put in a new order and give us beverages. As soon as we hung up, the first guy magically appeared and said he was just sitting on the wrong side of the building and his chains were messed up. Excuses but still not acknowledging the fact that he'd been lying. The next delivery person was great. She was nice and professional and arrived exactly when they said she would. 

The food was bland af!! The bbq shrimp didn't taste like bbq at all. The pasta was dry af. The fried food had a spice but no flavor. Like what the heck was going on."
2-sRIfKT31GFQD0OCnOmwQ,,"Tl; dr version: EARTHWORMS UNDER THE OYSTERS = BARF

Full version (as spoken in my inner patois): WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS?! 

WHY ARE THE RAW OYSTERS SO HUGE AND BLAND TASTING? 
Yes, they were fresh (like so fresh, they were still caked with dirt) and still in their 'liqueur', but I've never had oysters that tasted like big rubbery boogers.  There was no minerality, salinity, sweetness, or any of those awesome things I look for in oysters - also, the shucking job sucked AND there was no description as towards the type, beyond being big ass oysters that needed hot sauce and lemon juice just to get them in my gullet.

WHY ARE THERE 2 GIANT FUCKING EARTHWORMS CLINGING TO MY OYSTER SHELLS AND WHY ARE THEY MOVING?
Maybe next time, I won't squirt lemon juice on them to see if they're alive - they are O.o

OH GOD, WHY AM I BARFING AT THE TABLE IN MY NAPKIN? 
Because there's beer on the table, and you NEVER leave beer alone.

WHY DIDN'T I TELL OUR SERVER ABOUT THE WORMS? 
Fucking boyfriend just shrugged and ate all the oysters while I puked, so there was nothing to send back to the kitchen. Sometimes I hate fucking boyfriend.

HOW FUCKING GREEDY CAN I BE IF I DIDN'T GET UP AND LEAVE RIGHT THEN? 
Pretty damn greedy; after the puking incident, we changed tables and had the broiled oysters and split a 'peacemaker' po-boy. And more beer.

WHAT OTHER NASTINESS DID I ENCOUNTER? Surprisingly, none. The broiled dozen was tasty, in a ""everything coated in butter, garlic and parm cheese is amazing"" way, and the  1/2 fried oyster -  1/2 fried shrimp po'boy was ok because it was fried and filled to the brim, but overpriced.  Beer (Abita, natch) was delicious beer.

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME? 
I have no idea. 

Common sense says I shoulda sent the oysters back, but I didn't want to complain.  The broiled oysters and the po'boy slightly redeemed Acme, but I can't imagine coming back and waiting on line for 25 minutes for either.

Also- I puked at the sight of wormy oysters. Can't over look that.",
203ouoqdHcFPksNGpCMVNA,,"Okay, it's touristy...no denying that.  BUT OMG the oysters are amazing. They are large/huge, fresh, and naturally briny.  They are pricy but so good. I would recommend. I mean if you're going to try oysters you might as well go to the best place and have the best experience.  You don't get shell bits everywhere on the oysters. The shulkers really keep it clean. You can tell they know what they're doing. 

The chargrilled oysters were good but pricey. I would recommend you try them atleast once for the experience. They are good..don't get me wrong but just pricey for my blood.  The gravy cheese fries are good but I would have rather saved my money and gotten some more oysters. They are definitely the star. 

Great customer service. Very nice and friendly.",

Chose BLACKENED gator bites- after waiting 40 minutes for them they came fried... not blackened. They took it back and brought it back 20 minutes later corrected. Sadly, it wasn't worth the wait. On to the main course- I ordered fried oysters. They brought me fried catfish... Luckily it seemed to just be a mistake by the expeditor. My fried oysters came right out. They were really good! The main course really helped make up for the other issues. Then I ordered a hurricane. It wasn't good. Terrible mix, way too strong- better off with a $5 drink at one of the nearby bars. We also had a long wait for our check."
20dq_AGDUohxwJCkvsXNSA,"Whilst waiting in line, my husband and I conversed about our intended spiciness level and how the fact that we always order on the high end at Mexican or Asian restaurants meant we could go pretty hot. I ordered the Small White Meat (Hot) and he got a Large (Damn Hot).

Mine was probably a bit mild for my taste-- delicious, but it could have used more heat. My husband on the other hand immediately had tears pouring down his face. I took one sniff of his meat and it's spices punched me in the nose. Beyond that, I only ventured to have a tiny bite which started the nose waterfall. We were convinced that he'd been mistakenly given a Shut The Cluck Up but the waitress assured us it was correct. It is beyond me how anyone could regularly order a Damn Hot or even attempt the Shut The Cluck Up having tried it.

The sides were forgettable and probably served to deduct a star. If I could, I'd go back and get a Large White Meat (Hot)with no sides at all and maybe grab some sauce for the side.",,

Our drinks were good, but the bloody Mary was especially delicious with it's extra cajun seasoning. Prior to serving our food, Jerry made sure that we had hand sanitizer. Our food was served very fast like we requested.  We ordered the St James crepe and a seafood omelet.  Both were delicious! The cream sauce for the top of the omelet really set it above other seafood omelets that I've tasted. Jerry being very familiar with the area as a lifelong resident suggested activities based on our interests that we shared and he even got brochures for us. Jerry even offered us mints after our meal.

I'm a fan of anything pimento cheese related. I had enough for leftovers and took a box to go to stick in our mini fridge for later.

21wkkMppjxxLUS9xF9E5FQ,,,"Came here with my BFF for my birthday dinner. We met up in New Orleans, she came in from California, and I came in from Tennessee. We were departing the next day for a 5 day cruise. My friend found this place and made reservations. It's right in the French Quarter. There was a line of people when we got there, but again, we had a reservation. We were taken upstairs to a table and our server came by shortly to take drink orders.

Let me say, our server was wonderful. I believe her name was Kim. She was funny, and nice and very helpful. We saw her interact with other customers as well, and she was just as engaged with them as she was with us. Awesome service!

I started out with the Mandarin Blush drink and it was really good. Refreshing and fizzy. I think I had a few of these. For an appetizer we ordered the crab cakes. They were very tasty. That crawfish and mushroom sauce was soooo good. Almost licked the plate. While not the best crab cake I've ever had, the sauce really did bring it up to a different level, instead of the usual remoulade sauce typically served with crab cakes.

Then my BFF and I shared the Taste of New Orleans and our server even had it split for us into separate plates. Nice touch! It was great to have a pretty decent sized ""sampling"" of red beans & rice, jambalaya and crawfish etouffee. We even had some fried crawfish on top of it. It was plenty for both of us and left us some room for dessert.

Did I say dessert? Sure did. We shared the New Orleans Bread Pudding with some yummy kind of praline rum sauce. Oh my! Of course, it had a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it too. The 2nd time I wanted to lick the plate at this establishment. We tried to play it cool like we weren't gluttons and left two tiny little bites left. LOL.

Overall, it was a great experience, and I would definitely go back there. Thank you for a wonderful meal."

22YhcxjXKWbrjKZZcZUmqA,"I love Hattie B's and have eaten there countless times.  This is the original Hattie B's and the lines around the block are well-deserved.  The hot chicken is the best in town and a top tourist dining destination as well.  The hot chicken comes in all spice levels so picky eaters in your party can have the right level heat (Southern, Mild, Medium, Hot, Damn Hot, or Shut the Cluck Up).  The chicken is well-spiced where you can taste not just heat but spices (garlic, etc.) as well.  Delicious.  Portions are huge and tasty so order appropriately. The sides are top notch.  The pimento mac n cheese is my fave.  I really like the fries & southern greens too, but they're all good.  You can get cobbler or banana pudding for dessert; both are good, but the banana pudding is extraordinary.  There's attention to detail in all the little things from the lemonade and sweet tea to the quality of the sides and desserts to the hospitality you enjoy from the people who work there.  And if you want brunch, chicken & waffles and the bacon cheese grits side are only served on Sundays.  As for the lines, I recommend going on an off time.  What's an off time?  Early or late dinner, late lunch, you get my drift.  You'll be happy you didn't go right at prime time.  But, if you do, the line typically moves fairly speedily as the staff is typically very efficient at getting the hot chicken out the door.",,

Maybe I didn't order right, but the trio combo of jambalaya, red beans and rice, and crawfish etouffee were nice, but not remarkable. I will say the crab cake app with their signature sauce was savory and not too mushy or too many bread crumbs as fillers. The fried dishes coming out looked sizable and they had many sweet cocktail concoctions, if that's more to your liking. We were more in search of fresh, grilled seafood with notable Cajun influence. I'd ty this place again if with a group, but honestly there's other great places in the vicinity. After passing by Royal Bourbon and glancing at their dishes as we strolled by, I was easily envious of the quality and presentation of their dishes."

I just wasn't blown away. 3 chicken thigh pieces were over $15, and that's without sides or drinks. Personally, the pricing isn't worth it. There are other places that are cheaper and I'm sure the same or just as good in terms of flavor. Speaking of flavor, the chicken itself didn't have flavor, only the outside did and once that's gone, then you're left with flavorless chicken.

This place not only has top notch dining but there is something to be said about the experience. Don't go without expecting to wait in a line that wraps around the outside of the building, but with its downtown location, it makes for a fun place to stand around with friends and wait for a much anticipated dinner. My girlfriend is from Nashville and we love this place. If you ever have the chance trust us, its worth the wait! If you like spicy but don't want to melt your face, I highly recommend the medium spice, any hotter and it might be able to remove oil stains from your driveway, or polish metal.

I chose a table outside and within 10min my food was brought out to me piping hot. I chose hot seasoning, which there are different levels. Overall, I'd have to say it was on the spicier side.

Highly recommend the fresh oysters and charbroiled oysters. The oysters are very fresh and meaty. The seafood gumbo is also flavorful. Go for the half po-boy and gumbo combo. The fried fish po-boy sandwich is delicious. Skip the Boo fries. It came out cold and was really salty.

After reading about the epic lines, I ran from the Omni hotel to get here at 10:50am, initially feeling quite foolish, until I realize that the line had already started and by 11am, there were at least 20 people trying to get in on the hot chicken action. I had ordered the large dark meat  special, with medium and hot spice levels, and tried all the sides, including the mac n cheese, black eyed peas, collared greens, and potato salad. The staff were very helpful and even though I was as helpless and clueless as a toddler learning how to walk, they directed me to the outdoor patio and promptly brought out all of the delicious chicken. As far as the spices go, I think I definitely should have gotten the hot/hotter/hottest as the spices were more salty than spicy. The chicken meat, however was incredibly tender, fall out the bones and just a true delight. I devoured all of the dark meat and worked on the sides....in which aside from the mac n cheese, I really didn't develop a deep connection with any of them, mainly because they were kinda salty.

At the end of the day, I strongly recommend all visitors to check this place out (right when it opens) and be brave and try out the spicier sauces.

Food: 5 stars
Price: 4 stars (cash only)
Service: 4 stars
Ambiance: 3 stars",,
29RrUBxXpIh3YKN_tOvKXA,"OMG if you are fortunate to be able to get this chicken, it's worth whatever it took! lol. It's so...good. Their coleslaw is amazing too. If you've ever had Gus' Fried chicken in Memphis this to me is right up there with Gus' but spicier, so good! And all of the staff are really friendly.

One night we tried to go back there and of course the line was like an hour or two long so we tried to order online. You could not order online or at the counter so that was really frustrating. I think they should put that on the website when they do that so you don't keep trying to call. Just put ""only dine-in available"" from whatever time to whatever time it is. Unless I missed where they tell you this. Because we wasted time by driving down there to no avail.",,

I had the side Cesar and the Jambalaya pasta, I don't do spice hot food, the pasta had just enough kick, and a whole bunch of flavor. My friend has the gumbo, and enjoyed it. Glad we stopped here."

Great atmosphere and the food was delivered hot. Service overall was outstanding and prices were fair for portion size. Would recommend."
2AFHSkwcw7_oJmnfnGdsrg,,"We go here every time we are in New Orleans. It just seems like an institution to me. It's not fancy, but you know you're going to get amazingly fresh oysters, good drinks, and a very unpretentious and fun setting. There were four of us this time around. We started with a dozen fresh oysters and a dozen charbroiled... Got to say, I was kind of an oyster snob. I never liked oysters that were cooked. But these charbroiled ones were off the hook great! More drinks, then two more dozen oysters, then some rtouffee and a shrimp platter. I think anyway... We were kind of losing track there towards the end. :). Anyway, to me this is one of the quintessential New Orleans experiences. There's usually a line, but they're very efficient in how they handle that, and the wait really isn't that bad at all. You need to make a stop here! You really do.",

Char-broiled Oysters best I've had, with garlic, cheese! Shrimp platter and Po'boy light, fresh and delicious. Bloody Mary just enough heat. This is a must do when in town!",
2AS3Ezx5NObSY_6rE5CjaQ,,I absolutely love the charbroiled oysters have not had a restaurant yet to compare to their oysters. I'm a fan of  the gumbo and sandwiches. Didn't really care for the fried fish but I'm still giving 5 stars because the oysters are amazing.,

Hattie B's holds a special place in my heart, and no, I'm not talking about the heart burn from their highest heat level, Shut the Cluck Up.

Hattie B's constantly has a line wrapped around the building and down the street for a reason, their Nashville Hot Chicken is incredible! You cannot go wrong with anything you order there, unless you're sensitive to a little heat. You can find great hot chicken all over Nashville, but Hattie B's will always have me coming back for more.",,
2AXGmfd-7hN36LRLs8Mv0A,,,"I was very skeptical when walking in for the first time. My thoughts quickly changed after the first taste of the Cajun pasta. It had so much flavor in every bite! There was no comparison between the Cajun pasta here and the pasta at a nearby 'fancy' restaurant with the same name as the most famous street in this city! Great time, good drinks and great food!"
2B1x3wMVkSd_XozdPLXXWw,"Heard about & DREADED the line, but went around 4p and only wanted about 15-20 mins. I don't like spicy AT ALL so you can imagine my delights when I saw the ""Southern Style"" not spicy option for wimps like me. Scout out a seat while you're waiting & pray no one takes it, luckily for me, I was a solo diner and asked a family if they'd mind if I could sit ""with them"" on the edge of the counter. 
The chicken did not disappoint, it was light not heavy or greasy, was perfectly seasoned & perfectly cooked all white meat tenders; however the southern greens were alittle salty and needed some vinegar. The potato salad was FANTASTIC and could eat pounds of it. The sweet tea was brewed in house and reminded me of summers in the country w/ my family and could drink gallons of it. 

Servers were difficult to get attention and never received my ranch dipping sauce but was so hungry & chicken was so good, I wasn't going to bitch. 

I wanted to return for dinner but by then there was the line down the street. I'll be back though.",,
2B6PWhdbByM0o2oERsdsMA,,,"I feel like this place looks understated but the food here is surprisingly SO GOOD. And the portions are HUGE - if you don't have a big appetite I recommend you order family style and share a few dishes. Our appetizers filled us up to the point where we (hubby and I) didn't even make a dent in our main meals. We felt terrible wasting food and didn't take it to go because we were going out to Bourbon Street that night and didn't want to carry around leftovers. Side note: Bourbon Street is literally around the corner from this place, like 2 steps away so it's very conveniently located if you want to hangout there after dinner. We came as a group of 21 people for our friends birthday dinner. They sat us in the upstairs middle level (I think they have 3 floors?) and we were able to sit together in a long connected table, which was nice. Most other places in NOLA will accommodate a group of our size but they usually split us up into separate tables. 

Of the 21 people, we paired up about 4 people to share dishes. My group got crab cakes and charbroiled oysters to share - both are appetizers. The charbroiled oysters were AMAZING. That in itself could've been a meal. I'll be dreaming about them forever. For my main I got the Mardi Gras pasta, which was sooooo heavy and creamy but so delicious. My hubby got the fried seafood platter (too fried for us, too hard to eat that much fried food). He barely made a dent in it. From what I remember some of my friends got po-boys and others got jambalaya and the blackend chicken etc. With such a large group I'm sure everyone ordered a variety of things off the menu. The menu is large enough that everyone found something to eat, even the one vegetarian friend we had. The birthday girl got a bread pudding which we all passed around and had a bite of - it was very good. We were all way too full to order separate desserts. The waiters brought out the bread pudding with a candle and we all sang to the birthday girl. 

Service was good, we had 2 waiters attending to us since we were such a large group. They were able to give our group separate checks so we didn't have to split the bill in the end, which was nice. Hubby and I got our own meals and group appetizers on our check. I liked this place a lot. Two thumbs up."
2BDPF8zEzxD18X5EXZgRbQ,,,"I had breakfast there today.  Ordered the Country Breakfast (eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, grits, biscuit) and the Pain Perdue (upscale french toast).  It was all very good, and I really enjoyed it.  It is an informal place, with a happy air.  My only complaint would be that it took a while for the food to come, but it was pretty busy so it was not outrageously long."
2BYwsPnIUuU_7zZw7KdBKQ,,"The other 5 star reviews are correct; this place is fabulous. Don't flip over the line outside the door as I was seated at the bar in about 10 minutes. Tip: the hostess walks the line to be sure that your name is on her list. No need to fight your way to the front and get her attention. I ordered a half dozen charbroiled oysters. They were fresh and perfectly cooked. Next I had the shrimp po-boy. It was piled high with tender, lightly battered shrimp. The french bread was fresh savory. Bread pudding finished the meal. Not too sweet, warm and the perfect way to end the meal. Great service from Ms. Terri-Lee and the entire staff.",
2BbbCoN0EPKbv18n_tMJeA,,"Silly me,  I didn't realize I've never reviewed Acme until I uploaded a picture to Acme's Yelp page and Yelp was like, ""shouldn't you review Acme?"", so here it goes.

I first went to Acme as a tourist before I moved to New Orleans.  It was my first experience with crawfish, so I didn't know what the hell I was doing.  The server was super nice and showed me her method for eating the little buggers.  They were delicious.  I have been back here and to the location in Metairie quite a few times and have never been disappointed.  The po-boys are acceptable and the fish specials are always good. This doesn't need to be said, but the oysters are great.

The drawback to this location is the wait.  Every tourist* in the French quarter wants to go to Acme, so there is an incessant line (which I guess is part of the authentic Acme experience).

*Yes, I used to be one of them :)",
2BczxErTgYXiQMl7nPsp5w,"Was in town for business with one of my employees.  He's not much of a drinker and didn't mind waiting online while I was across the street drinking beer . It's actually a GREAT system if you have buds with you. 

Now for the food........ DAMN GOOD CHICKEN!!! Damn good! Spicy, crispy, juicy, spicy (again). 

Totally worth it if you do the buddy system while you wait online. I don't love chicken enough to wait an hour, but it was definitely worth doing once (if you can swing the buddy system).",,
2BdaxtIhTYrRmfrWb7lJHg,,"Great food!! Long lines to get in, but they squeezed us in within 15mins. I loved the fried fish (catfish) and shrimp. Oysters were fresh and sweet... Beer was cold... Perfect!",
2BeZW4_osTt4I9xkrSdktA,"After passing by on a tour and hearing that this was done if the best Chicken in Nashville, I had to try it!!! Why else would it be a stop on a tourist tour if it wasn't legit? The line was down the block and with the bus running every 30 minutes, I quickly bookmarked the gem so that I could return after the tour.

So when I returned the line was not nearly as long as it was early. All in all I think it took 15-20 minutes to get the the register to place our order. Undue if how hot mild was I chose to sit on the side of caution. Spiciness is always in the hands of the preparer, I figured I had to get some level of heat. Southern was no heat at all, so I definitely wasn't doing that.  The list of sides was long so I opted for greens and fries.  My drink of choice was the Honky Tonk Blonde, decent beer- no disappointment here.  

After finding a seat and the food was delivered the explosion began.  Man, whoever was on mild duty today got a different vibe for mild. I would say it wasn't mild at all!! The level of heat on this mild level has my lips tingling and my tongue doing a two step! I loved it!! The seasoning was perfect!! The meat was large chunks of white meat tenders!! A little greasy and the white of my French tip nails were tainted orange but after grabbing my fork I was good to go!! The fries were perfectly  seasoned and the greens gave me that down home southern feel. 

You can't go wrong with anything you choose!  Everyone enjoyed their food. Little mad I did t have room for the peach cobbler or the bread pudding but from the looks of it, you wouldn't be disappointed. 

Inside is small for the amount of traffic that comes thru but it's worth it! Parking sucks as you are better of parking to park unless you can snag one of the few free spaces.  Pack your patience and you won't be disappointed!",,
2BjV7RLZ8x8cmz3IKVeuTg,,,"Came here for a late dinner. Great service! Drinks were good! We had blackened catfish and oceana famous oysters. Oysters were great! I thought the catfish serving was a little small.. $17 for a single, fairly thin fillet with an also somewhat small side of jambalaya and collard greens. I'm from New York City so I'm used to expensive entrees but they're usually worth the money there, but I get it- this place is right off Bourbon St. Other than that no other complaints!"
2Bl4uSq7gjCYLLORpKb-aA,"I've been to Hattie B's several times now and I don't get the hype.  The service was excellent, the atmosphere was fine, and the food was good but not great and definitely not the best hot chicken in Nashville.",,
2BqGWgVLmQPyjTZQpB8ioQ,,The fresh oysters were fabulous but the charbroiled oysters were absolutely amazing. They come with bread so after you eat your oyster you dip the bread into the garlic butter sauce left in the shell and soak it all up into the bread and eat the bread like that. Amazing!,

I normally get a half dozen of chargrilled for an app, and Crawfish etouffee with two catfish filets as my entree. Cant go wrong at this place.",You can't go wrong with the Cajun Jambalaya pasta.

2CMNHpSkG72HihaHFpG-aA,"A little background - I fell off the vegetarian wagon about a year ago. I hadn't had chicken in about 16 years. Over the course of the last year, I tried a few bites here and there but the bird I tasted was underwhelming and seemed a waste. Until Saturday night.

Our plan was to go to Prince's and, after a recommendation from a friend, we re-routed ourselves to midtown for Hattie B's. I had the white plate (hot) with mac n cheese, greens, and the three of us shared peach cobbler. My compadres ordered theirs southern style (no heat) and mild - wusses. My first bite took my breath away - literally. I wasn't prepared for the heat - it was awesome. After I recovered from the tingle, I dug into the juiciest piece of bird I think any of us have ever had. It was delicious. The sides were also great. We had a lot of very tasy food at a very reasonable price. I love the atmosphere and the good folk that work here - we'll be repeat customers fo sho.",,
2CdBuGngxeQ-QdqBBVd0hw,"By far my favorite hot chicken restaurant in the area.  Hattie B's is *the* standard for Nashville.  They always have a great selection of local beers.

To-Go pickup is immediate and allows you to order 15-20 mins in advance, pick up your food, and either take it home or simply eat at the restaurant.",,

2CpQN29lih7XoLNQWoy_Qw,,,Came here for lunch on our NOLA trip. Our waitress was the absolute sweetest. We had the oysters famous to the restaurant and they were AMAZING.  We had the ahi-tuna which was pretty good - a good size!! There always seemed to be a line out front and we now understand why!

Thanks Acme Oyster House for making my Husbands first time in New Orleans tasty!!",
2D_67nIZk2HIQOcf4pNGgQ,,"We go here for the tasty charbroiled oysters. Their standard New Orleans/ Creole fare is also tasty, but a little pricey for the small portions you receive. Also, be wary of events/ time of day/day of week when you go- you WILL wait in line (best time- weekdays after the noon lunch crowd). Overall, you can get a pretty good meal here when you are in the French Quarter or near their Metairie location.",
2DcpsxwvtvTKBxVI1-nQ7Q,"When you see lines down the block with people waiting to get in you know the place is good.  And Hattie B's is well worth the wait.  I never heard of ""hot chicken"" before coming to Nashville and now I'm a big fan.  Hattie B's is a place you go to to eat.  Not to admire the paintings on the wall.  I had my first ""hot chicken"" at the restaurant and it was great.  The white meat chicken was made just right, moist, fried but not greasy.  The hot sauce cooked in made it far better than plain fried chicken.  I went for the mild hot sauce and I could have gone for any of 3 levels of hotter sauce but I was . . . Chicken.  I was not unhappy with my choice of sauce as a first attempt.  The sides of fries and Mac and Cheese were also very good. This is a place worth waiting on line for.",,

They were extremely late with the food and the servers barely came to check on our table (they came around about twice during the 45min wait for the food after we had ordered). I'm still giving it a 4-star because the food was really delicious.
2DnnIfT22v795Xo-6Sjyqw,,"I first ordered the chargrilled oysters, then 3 lbs of crawfish, catfish and shrimp platter, and the soft shell crab po boy. First of all, the chargrilled oysters were over hyped. It's okay but not THAT good like everyone else says it to be. The crawfish were par with a Chinese buffet's crawfish. If yall don't know what that means...it means don't waste your money on crawfish here. The catfish platter was to die for. The catfish itself was the best dish in the restaurant. It melts in your mouth as it first reside on your tongue. Holy hell, I can still remember the euphoric feeling that night when I first lost my Acme virginity. After eating the fried catfish...nothing, not even the house specialty soft shell crab po boy could stand a chance. I fell in love all over that night. The line is long so get there early and minimize the number of people you to bring in your group.",

In all it was approximately 45 minutes from back of line to ingestion. Friendly staff, descent food. I'm glad I went based on all the love for this restaurant. However, my personal preferences would direct me to an alternative cuisine. It was my first hot chicken experience, and if it was my last I'd be fine with that.",,

Even if you don't like raw oysters, these chargrilled ones will make you happy. From the first bite to the last drips of butter Parmesan oyster liquid, this was really good.",
2FThL9VtdO9lsaThpzi4wQ,,,"We come here all the time and I'm finally writing a review. This review may be slightly skewed because we first discovered this place on my first trip to NOLA before moving here when I was desperately hungry. 

The place is huge inside so even if you have to wait in line it doesn't usually take to long. And, if it does just pop into the bar next door and grab a to-go drink while you're waiting. There are 2 seating areas downstairs + an outdoor patio and 2 areas upstairs. 

We almost always get the same thing - blackened ahi tuna. The portion size is large and fills you up for sure. We usually swap out the sides for mashed potatoes since theirs are really good. My main call out is that the side of ""mixed vegetables"" is not a classic veggie medley like you might expect. Rather it's liked some combo of blended greens. Not my favorite honestly and I usually like veggies."

The meal was ok...comes with 3 small pieces of bread and 3 small bowels with the different tastes (jambalaya, crawfish, red beans with rice and sausage) with a few crawfish added to the top of each bowel.

The pimento mac and cheese had good flavor, really creamy and smooth. I also ordered the banana pudding but was disappointed -- I'm not sure why, perhaps the pudding part? It was a classic nilla cookie, bananas, pudding, and whipped cream type of banana pudding. To me, it was just dense, rather than creamy. I probably wouldn't choose to wait in the line again but may settle for take-out. I much preferred the hot chicken at Slow Burn, outside of Nashville.",,

2JyM6_ryuGgkUSCVQD_7dw,"I would definitely put this on your list to try. The Pimento Mac & Cheese and Banana Pudding would have it at a 5 star, but the Southern Chicken and other sides were just average. My husband likes a little spice and chose the mild.  He said it had a nice red pepper heat, but not too much. The atmosphere is cozy but fun. Great place to visit on our way back to Kentucky.",,
2K0om-WalU8ukCppEEtTig,This is an event not a meal! I look so forgot going back here the next time I'm in Nashville. The fried chicken sandwich is my top pick but my husband had the fried chicken plate and loved it! 100% the beat chicken I've ever had.,,

My favorite drink was the tropical storm, such a good price, strong, and came with a cute souvenir cup that you could refill forever! The kitchen did mess up a couple times but she handled it very well and made sure it was perfect the next time. Some of my fav dishes were: blackened gator bites (YUM!!!!), crab cakes, and the fried seafood platter. The catfish was SO FRESH and tasty. I will definitely come back when I'm in town. :)"
2KgmJqvlUvW3UydAXpMRuQ,"The food that we ""received"" was great, but it's very hard to understand how an Uber order goes out the door half incomplete.  The restaurant has the receipt, but the employees putting food in bag can't check off what's in there.  I find it incredibly hard to believe being we had over a $100.00 order and only received 3 plates of food and the restaurant didn't even check it.  I don't care how busy, or the time of year; if restaurants are willing to charge these ""inflated"" prices, they better back it up w service and what they are serving.   Very disappointed in this staple nashville restaurant.  Extremely disappointed.",,
2KquSGfWJt9g0_CoQ1X82A,"TLDR: Good food, fair price, get here before the rush.

The food:
The food was great, hot was just right for me. Portion sizes were awesome, 1/4 chicken and two sides was more than enough for a full meal. I got the banana pudding as well, which was both delicious and huge.

The service:
Service was great. Everyone was friendly and I got my food quickly. I showed up right before the lunch rush which helped a ton.

I'd stop here again, just know there might be a wait depending on when you show up.",,
2LCJ3aBqY3LHlV2HSW1apg,,A must if you're in NOLA. Can't go wrong with their infamous broiled oysters! It's the best in NOLA. Make sure you come to this location and not the one at Harrahs. Made that mistake my first night and regretted it. This location oysters tasted way better than the rest. Perfect amount of cheese and butter. Their deep crawfish and crawfish étouffée was really good as well.,
2LEiHpHrs8pUOjqe4jvxhw,,,"Unfortunately upon entering the restaurant we were met by two hostesses that thought their personal conversation was much more important. Once they finally finished, they greeted us, but didn't say how long it would be, so we found ourselves kind of milling around. Once we were finally seated we ordered drinks and crabcakes. Both were pretty good. I ordered the duck which was ok. Our waitress didn't really check on us as frequently as I would have liked and we found ourselves there quite a while looking for her. Maybe this was an off night for them, but I probably won't be going there next time I'm in town."
2LSJberDT1DyIoL1H_NYIQ,"Stopped in for a late lunch.  I had the large white meat (2 Breast's and a wing) (Hot).  Ordered the pimento Mac and cheese and the coleslaw.  First the line was out the door but I think this was more timing than anything.  The cashier was polite, courteous and helpful.  The food came out quickly so in-spite of the line it moved fast.  The chicken was moist and the skin was crunchy.  The hot was about the right heat for me and it was tasty not painful.  I might try the xtra hot next time.  The pimento Mac and Cheese was good but it didn't really wow me.  The coleslaw.  Meh.  It tasted like it came from a jar so I will try another side next time.  The iced tea was very good and fresh.  All in all hot chicken is a Nashville tradition and you would be hard pressed to find a better chicken.  Hattie B's is an institution and you probably should put it on your to do list.  I'm going back so that says a lot.",,

a stop here. The chicken is flavorful, not dripping in oil, and juicy. Friendly staff-- no matter how busy they get.

We ordered drinks with Ron but somehow one of the other waiters took them. I'm not even sure how that works but we were waiting a while for the drinks. Ordered the crabcakes and bbq shrimp and it was fantastic! I could pour that bbq shrimp sauce all over me. I ordered the seafood gumbo which wasn't my fave. For my entree, I did the seafood fried platter. HOLY MOLY! That's alot of food but it was great! The batter is special and has a kick to it. Not spicy kick but seasoned kick! 

We also ordered the blackened duck and it was amazing! Don't forget dessert. Must save room for the chocolate mousse cake and creme brulee. I was mad I didn't get the brownie but there is always next time!"

The chicken was just spicy and salty, I couldn't really tastes much of any other flavors besides those.   The chicken was okay, maybe a little over cooked.  The mac n cheese was good but I've had better.  We waited for almost 30 min around 10 at night on a Friday and I would have to say it wasn't really worth the wait.",,

2NIAihks06vyn7RQuWasYg,,"First tried Acme Oyster House at the Harrah's casino and had the grilled oysters. Absolutely DELICIOUS! From the oysters to the bread to dip with. I definitely had to try the restaurant after that, and another order of grilled oysters. There's almost always a line in front but it is certainly worth it. I ordered the traditional Cajun dish, seafood Etoufee, the flavor was great. Only down side was the quality of the shrimp, very tiny, and it could've used a little more rice for the gumbo style dish. Make sure not to overload on oysters and etoufee because the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream is AMAZING! Craving some now writing this review!",
2NM7LXmsgRrv8qhd4VnMsQ,,"Delicious food. The charbroiled oysters was yuuuuuummmmmm. Shrimp etouffee and pecan cobbler was great to and the mint julup. Great service and atmosphere. Food was served fast, fresh and hot. Staff was great. Do not visit the French quarters without dining here.",

2N_gW_rtIoVzifhgdRX9og,"I consider myself a connoisseur of all things hot and spicy, and I'm pretty sure that I may have an addiction to capsaicin. When I go to Thai restaurants, I now say ""native Thai - hurt me, make me cry""; I seriously may have a real problem. 

So I keep hearing about this ""hot chicken"" stuff floating around Nashville, and I really want to believe that chicken could be made hot enough for me. The only previous experience I have had with hot chicken was with Prince's Hot Chicken at the Hot Chicken Festival. The year that I went, they were only serving ""medium"" because apparently ""hot"" was just way too much for some folks. I thought the ""medium"" had a pleasant flavor, but it was just not hot like I wanted. I have been hearing great things about Hattie B's, and of course after reading my fellow Yelper's reviews, I knew that I had to give it a shot.

I ordered online, which was a breeze and I highly recommend. I showed up at my allotted time, and after making my way around the extremely long line, my name was called within two minutes of my arrival through the entrance. I am very glad I didn't have to wait in that ridiculous line. Overall a quick and painless process. 

After reading the reviews, I thought maybe I would start off with the ""Damn Hot"" since everyone says that it's extremely hot. In the back of my mind, I was thinking I would be really disappointed that it wouldn't be quite hot enough. I could NOT have been more wrong. About 3 seconds into my first bite and I knew that I had met a worthy adversary. This chicken is literally coated with hellfire and brimstone. As I am eating my first piece, I am thinking ""there is no way this is 'damn hot' - surely a mistake has been made and I am actually eating 'shut the cluck up'!"" If you decide to order ""damn hot"", please realize that the coating on the outside doesn't have a lot of flavor. I would describe it as caustic, trenchant, and earthy. It's not designed for flavor, it's designed to inflict otherworldly pain. I know the traditional way to make hot chicken would be to coat the outside of fried chicken with a mixture of cayenne and lard (mostly the former). I don't think there is any way that ""damn hot"" has just cayenne in it. It certainly has something in it much higher on the Scoville scale. Let's be real, the only reason this is served on a piece of white bread is to soak up those corrosive juices and prevent them from burning through the styrofoam container. Trust me when I say that you will need the bleu cheese dressing to add some flavor and to cool down your yapper. 

Bottom Line: If you are down with food that sears your insides like napalm, then you definitely have to check out Hattie B's! 4.5 stars.",,
2Nt1Mw1p3TEGFJs5DvGbuw,,"Returned to this place for a second time. Raw oysters, char-grilling oysters and soft shell crab. All delicious. There's a reason there's always a line out the door for this place",
2OQFU-48Np134sudLgLiNQ,"It's rare I ever give 5 stars. We had to see what the hype was all about. We decided on this location because one it was close, but two it's the original! You have to come to the original the first time. Of course there was a line, even on a weekday at 8pm. They closed at 10pm so we knew we had time. The wait was about half an hour. The menu is simple, chicken & what heat you want. I got the tenders mild, as I really can't do hot. My boyfriend got the tenders hot, I did try a piece. The chicken was flavored so well. The heat on the hot was great but I personally couldn't eat a whole tender of it. The mild was perfect for me. You pick a sauce on the side but honestly you don't even need to drench it in sauce it's just so good. You get two sides with each tender order. Between both of us, we ordered mac n cheese, potato salad, collard greens, & fries. It was all delicious. The staff was fast & helpful. We also ordered banana pudding & peach cobbler. We loved it all! 

This place is so worth it!",,
2Ob66iqg7cKoZ8uuEGwPSA,,All i can say is... the hype is real. It isnt a NOLA trip without eating at Acme. We had to wait 30 mins to be seated but it was worth it! Acme definitely made my NOLA trip!,
2Ob6zuKihFDQPb21IMA3qQ,,,Great service! Great food! The crab cakes are larger than most places and the best I've ever tasted. Loaded fries make perfect late night food.
2Osf9_qR58atZ2ZGpRawjg,,,"We ordered the fried seafood platter. The catfish was light, hot, crunchy, and perfectly seasoned. The oysters were delicious, fries delicious, shrimp the best. The cole slaw was tangy and crisp. The only down side was that the hush puppies were a little heavy and the jalapeño was undetectable. We also got the blackened catfish which was perfect. Really loved the greens and rice that accompanied it. My girls got a Bloody Mary that was spicy and made them happy!! The establishment was really well run. Everyone was on their best game it seemed: waiters, hostess. Unity was evidenced."
2Oz1BZTcfnUV4SWq4Pyzyg,,Good oysters at a reasonable price.  Fried shrimp and oyster po'boy was really good too.  Definitely a place worth checking out.,
2PWDXwCPUNhPhajK8G217w,,,"Just ok. The oysters and drinks were really good, but the maiN coarse was sub-par. The food seemed overly cooked and lacked flavor. Not everything needs to be fried hard! Also the bread pudding was too damn thick. It had a decent flavor, but the thickness and gummy-ness of it took away from the rating. Overall, the only reason this place probably get patroned is because it's right off Bourbon St."
2PbqoondFz8J7BcXbI1EQw,,"After watching Adam Richman eat nearly 180 oysters on Man vs Food we had to come here for the oysters. After only 15 minutes waiting in line on a Friday night, J and I were able to get a seat at the oyster bar - this was great because the guys who shuck the oysters like to have a grand ole time chatting up the out-of-owners. 

The restaurant was divey and dimly lit from the neon ACME sign out front painting the room a jazzy red. We ordered the below:

Dozen raw oysters ($14) freshly shucked. These were great - they are juicy and plump. Not briney like some of LI oysters and not overly oceany like some of the west coast ones I've had. They were creamy but the didn't overpower your palette. 

Dozen grilled oysters ($20) - these were grilled with parmesean cheese and breadcrumbs. They were good but I liked Cochon's wood-fired ones better (possibly because too much Food Network has told me dairy and seafood don't mix?).

Shrimp Etouffe ($9) - this was the first time I have had etouffe and maybe I am just not a fan of etouffe in general but the dish was very medicore. There were quite a few baby shrimp in the dish but the flavor just wasn't there and the roux was too thin.

Soft-shell crab for 2 ($23) - thick battered giant soft shell crab - just how the south likes it. The soft shell grab was yummy but I am very picky about my fry batter and this was just a tad too thick and thought it could have been seasoned better. It had a good crunch though.

We left full, and happy but the 4 beers and alcoholic smoothie from Bourbon could have been a factor.",
2PnYWZlZ2-kT2HQTX8M2Cg,"Yeah, this is the real deal.  I ordered the small dark meat hot.  It was hot....but perfect hot.  I Didn't get the hiccups or anything but my mouth was burning.  I'm going back as soon as I'm back in Nashville.",,
2Q270lEmgaUfi2Bk1PcCcw,,,Great food!  I had the seafood special and Justin had the taste of New Orleans. Both were outstanding!!  C.J our server made the night perfect.  We will come back here again and again!!

We split an awsome Cheesecake!"
2QW6dmKcxI91As-GeiW1zw,Tried Hattie B's for the first time. Hope it won't be the last. The chicken sandwich is an awesome concoction. The fries are seasoned yummily and the pimento Mac and cheese is out of this world. Then we shared a peach cobbler with ice cream.  Yeah baby! Highly recommend.,,
2QX1jqsbaaMulrd13zC7pQ,,"We came here twice during our New Orleans trip. We got their charcoal grilled oysters, raw oysters, the Etouffee with fried crawfish tails, 1/2 fish 1/2 shrimp Po-boy, beers, and the mojito cocktail. The food was absolutely amazing and the service was even better even though they're always very busy. We came for lunch and once for dinner and the wait time wasn't too bad, roughly 20-30 minutes. Only took off one star because their oysters had a lot of cracked shells in them, which made it difficult to eat. Also the Etouffee was slightly salty the first time we were here.",

2Q_1kMY9QPjaGmVAjcGgCg,,,"​Was in New Orleans visiting from Dallas and traveled with friends for Southern Decadence. After a long evening clubbing we woke up the next day very hungry. After a quick swipe on Yelp! and seeing how the restaurants received so many positive reviews, it was very telling that would be an ideal option for where we want to eat. 


Upon arrival, there was a little bit of a wait but the hostess got my name and said when the whole group (10 of us) are present, we'd be seated. One of my buddy and I hung out at the bar and enjoyed glasses of Mimosas while we wait. Eventually, everyone showed and as promised, we were seated.  


Just be advised there are two stories and the upper deck is where you want to be. Downstairs seemed a bit cramped for my taste. Our server was awesome and did agreat job taking care of our large party, she even offered us separate checks making it more convenient for everyone. 

​Price wise, plates average around $10 to $17 and the menu had all my favorites including Fried Oysters which is a must have while in New Orleans.  


Overall, a cute place with great service and not far from clubs and hotels especially if you are staying in the French Quarter. Highly recommend!"

We were a group of 6 that were taken care of like we were the only people in the place.  Our server Errol was FANTASTIC! He has a voice like Michael Clarke Duncan and actually sang for us too.  On to the food, the gator bites were delicious, the Crab Cakes could be done gluten-free, and they were awesome!  Their Taste of New Orleans truly gave you a taste of the city.  We went back the next night for desert and their Chocolate Kahlua Mousse with a shot of Kahlua was the perfect end to our night."

In the fried chicken arena, Hattie B reigns king. I got the mild and it had a hint of a kick, which is all I wanted. My biggest kudos is to how JUICY the chicken was. I don't know what dark magic was used to fry the chicken and still have it come out this juicy, but it worked. All the sides were creamy and delicious as well.

He was truly amazing and very knowledgeable about all the food and everything he recommended exceeded our expectations.

Catfish was junk enough to not finish it. Batter on the fry up was lacking in flavor. Tartar sauce that came with it was not good. 

The rest of the food was good. The crab cakes were different from regular tastes, but I actually enjoyed it more as the flavor was simpler. 

The portions are big and matches the bigger price."

2UyRTW8KyKcqqqWihpFISA,,,"Went there today around 3. I have to say the food was amazing. However, the service was the absolute worst I have ever experienced in a restauarant. The female hostess did not want to be at work and it was extremely obvious. She walked off to seat another couple. Male hostess comes to ""seat"" us. He walks us into the room points to our table and tells us to go have a seat & he will bring us menus in a minute (he had menus in his hand). Needless to say he never brought us a menu. 10 minutes later waitress comes by to get drink order and then went to get us menus. Waitress Janette Z only came by to get drink order, food order & bring us the bill. She never checked about our drinks- yes our glasses were dry. The restaraunt was not busy & she only had 4 tables that were no more than 4 to a table. She was not present on the floor to check on any of her tables. Amazing how bad service can ruin a good meal."
2V0_Mj4JC1lFDhfyUupksQ,,,Great and authentic Cajun cuisine. Seafood gumbo id's full of seafood and seasoned perfectly.  At the recommendation of the server Jasc the salmon burger shock came Hoi fresh and blackened.  Def a great place to hit. Bree served us and did a nice job.  It feels a bit pricey on some menu items.
2VRzxV_FzKWEOMNw-NgnGA,,,"First stop on our food fest.

My companions laughed when I ordered the red beans and rice. I have limited options not being a seafood eater. But isn't New Orleans about red beans and rice?

My food was delicious and I had my first hurricane drink which tasted like a delicious fruit punch.

I got a chain restaurant feel from this place or a total tourist trap. We fell for it but it wasn't so bad. We also tried the gator....I think the size of this appetizer was lacking.

All in all the food was decent."
2VazoldzAODCnadjYeNGnQ,,"Must go if you're visiting New Orleans. Great local atmosphere, staff was friendly and let us try an raw oyster before we ordered. Chargrilled oysters were unreal!! Shrimp po boys was great and a hurricane to finish but have to get bread pudding for desert!!",

We got the fried gator bites and gumbo for appetizers. I enjoyed the gator bites a lot I def recommend! 
We also got the jambalaya and the blackened redfish étouffée...both we're simply phenomenal!
It was my boyfriend's birthday so she was kind enough to get everyone at the restaurant to sing to him and also gave him some banana pudding.
Delicious meal, great service! Def would come back for Whitney & the food!!"

I suggest the potato salad, Mac n cheese & the black eyed peas. 
Sarah at the register was a great help, giving us first timers guidance & suggestions.",,

I ordered the chef ""speciality"" the Duck in praline sauce and my husband ordered the fried catfish. Both were pre-made. Our dinner came out about 5 mins after we placed our order. The duck skin was so soft not crispy at all and portions of it were dry. The sauce tasted like they opened a can of sweet condensed milk and just poured it over the poorly cooked duck. My husband fried catfish was also dry, but as any chef or even good cook knows reheated food can become DRY. I was so disappointed.. $50 down the drain for crumby food. We won't ever be coming back, I'd rather eat a slice of pizza."

2XHr-Pdqqdp__sgK3pcKZQ,,"Wow, just wow!   My memory must've been foggy because when I came over 12+ years ago, I didn't remember it being such a slam dunk!

As you all know, this is one of those touristy places that you have to go to if you've never been to NOLA but for the record, let me tell you, it's SO worth the trip.  We tried Felix, Killer Poboy and NOLA Poboys all in the same week and none of these places served a better Poboy than the Peacemaker at Acme.  So ginormous, you can actually just share this and you'd still be full to the gills.  GET IT!  5/5

And contrary to popular opinion as New Englanders, I'd also stuff your face with at least a half dozen of the Chargrilled Oysters as opposed to ordering the standard raw preparation.  Taste tested and confirmed as we ordered both.  I know you're shocked!  Why you ask?  It's actually quite simple.  The local oysters here from the Gulf of Mexico (on average) are much larger yet more milder tasting so it's perfect to try these prepared in other cooking methods.   We absolutely enjoyed these and it's forever changed our perspective that a cooked oyster could never taste as good as the raw variety.  5/5   

If you're into crab cakes, they do it quite well here too.  Ask for a side of their special house remoulade sauce and make sure you smother it well with it.  You can work it all off later :)  4/5

Really liked the decor of the place too.  It added to the friendly, casual Southern character you'd expect.  Service was all around friendly and we totally lucked out too since we were there during the slow season and didn't need to wait for a table and it's unheard of for this place.  

It's a ""can't miss"" spot.  If the line is out the door, I'd suggest you try again to go on an off time.  You won't be sorry!",
2XgvN35TRQdFsYV0njVM6A,"So... We were told to go to this place by a quite many people.... We waited in line for about 30 minutes. So that's how you know it's good.

It's too bad the chicken and waffles we're only on Sunday otherwise I would have gotten that.   I had gotten the 2 large dark meat with 2-3 sides... The backed beans, greens were off the hook. Then I decided to sink my teeth into the chicken, but it was only medium heat and it had a pretty good kick to it.... The highest heat was ""what the cluck"". Chose not to do it since I wanted to do other stuff that day and didn't want my ass to catch .

Really really good chicken, probably some of the best I've ever had. But it did take a while for a food to come, which sort of annoyed me because they didn't apologize.... There were two groups of people that sat down after us and got their food before us, which I was a little annoyed about. 

But other than that. It was pretty damn good. If you got time. Hit this place up.",,

I had the red beans and rice- which was very good- the texture was more like refried beans, which I didn't mind at all.  There was also a spicy sausage in there as well which was very good.  My husband had steak and shrimp that was covered in their crayfish sauce and he said it was one of the best steaks he's had in a long time.   Very good."

2YTDpaE9yloF7OvlURZbuQ,,,"We can't think of anything bad to say about our visit to Oceana this past weekend.  

Our new friend Keith over at Johnny White's (hole in the wall) recommended it and we're glad he did.

Not only was the food good (following) but the service was FRIENDLY, fast and attentive.  Lacy was just awesome and obviously works her tush off!  Thank you, Lacy!

Food:  I enjoyed the Ribeye Steak (die-hard red meat fan here) with Shrimp sauce.  Good cut of steak; not great, but good and nicely flavored and well prepared.  Wife had the blackened Aji Tuna which was just off the charts in terms of outright delicious, intense pan-seared flavors; sweet, salt and spice all in one!  My bro had the Crawfish Etouffe which was truly delicious with a mouthful of crawfish in that wonderful sauce!  My sis enjoyed the seafood pasta (Fettucini?) special that was overwhelmed with shrimp, crawfish, red-fish, mussels and clams in a well-balanced cream sauce.  Yum!

Dessert was Pecan Pie; nice, not ""oh my God"" great, but satisfying (note: PLEASE start keeping some 'Nilla ice cream on hand!)  The Chocolate Mousse was closer to gustatory orgasm, however and is well recommended!

Dinner for four WITH drinks AND dessert and with no reservations came to about $40 per person with tip.  In my book that is reasonable for the friendly service and good food!

Also, they're the only place we found in the 1/4 with XRated Vodka; a nice plus!  Cheers!

PS:  We placed an order on Sunday from Johnny White's and enjoyed some of the best fried shrimp we've EVER had!!!  How do they do that?"

Service: impeccable! Our server was Shane and he was 5 stars. Every server or host we encountered was 5 stars, in fact. One night we sat at the bar and the next on the outdoor patio (highly recommend!). Patio ambiance was cute, cozy, romantic. NOW: the food... YES! Crab cakes have a mushroom sauce on them which was unique but they were STELLAR. My husband got a jambalaya dish, gator bites, and blackened steak.

Hattie B's may not be the favorite of some of those hanging on to their reviews of Prince's or Bolton's (both dirty dumpy restaurants with good hot chicken).  But Hattie B's is the best of them all.  Of all the chicken shacks, this one is consistent.  The chicken is cook perfectly every time.  Consistency is lacking at all other joints - often the chicken elsewhere is overcooked and rubbery.

A huge plus - No other chicken joint sells beer.  What better beverage to wash down all that spice?  And there is football on the TVs, a clean restaurant, and a nice patio. Best hot chicken joint in town no question!!!",,

The food looked amazing however I was a bit disappointed. First off there was too much batter on the chicken and it was way too greasy. It wasn't as spicy as expected. The portions are large. The sides were just ok but the Mac and cheese and fries were really good. 

After we our food, we felt very sick because the chicken was way too oily for us. I'm glad I tried it but would not return. I actually like Gus's fried chicken better.",,

These were the only dinners of the week without reservations, we waited 20 minutes on Sunday and 60 on Friday.  This place a busy and high bustle; fun atmosphere.

The chargrilled oysters were good and affordable relative to the rest of the french quarter.

Boo Fries - french fries and gravy - come on, if you are order the type of person who would order this (like use) then you will like this app.

Fried Crab Claws - too much batter; no crab taste
Fried Alligator Bites - no meat/protein flavor; just batter and sauce
Butter Beans Platter - tender, meaty/smokey flavor with great fried fish
Red Beans/Rice - decent (not the best of the week)
Jambalaya - pretty good here (try the taste of NOLA)
Fried Fish platter - great Catfish
4 dollar draft beer

The 4 stars due to the price and quality of the food. 

The Char-grilled oysters were truly amazing. I didn't eat oysters until these. This was the star of the week.

There certainly wasn't the best food and definitely not the worst we had in New Orleans but some of the best food for the price.",

It is an icon in NOLA, and it shows.  We had chargrilled oysters in many places in NOLA and I have to say this place is my favorite.  Lots of places in the area are good, but ACME has the best chargrilled flavor.   You taste the oyster, butter, and garlic as well.   Other places are a little heavy on the parm or garlic.   These were on point!

I even bought an ACME koozie for my beer.  Highly recommended.",

DO go to Acme Oyster House - it's delicious.

DON'T go during normal mealtime hours, because the wait can be awful. 

I showed up about 11 PM, looking for any place that still had good food for the night... Acme had it.
 
I came back a couple days later for lunch, but no bueno: the line was always out the door, with over a 30 minute wait.

So come late, have a nice po boy or some oysters, and wash it down with a turbo dog on tap. You'll leave happy.",
2bGFRUV6U06p3GxpzuHaUQ,,Its overhyped touristy places like this that I don't like at all. Our friends took us here and the oysters were small compared to the ones served by Dragos. It was not bad but I think most places in the district is like this. The soft shell crab was good but I wasn't overly impressed.,

2bHSZhM0huV8LRh3YHaOSQ,,"Quite possibly the best sausage sandwich I have ever had in my life and I don't even know how that's possible since I make them all the time.  You would think that if you were making your own sausage sandwich, you'd do the best job since it would be exactly what you wanted, right?  Well, now I know I want that spicy sausage they used.  And the bread.  I had a half of a sausage po'boy and a side of jambalaya.  The staff was friendly and efficient, if not effusively so.  I sat at the oyster bar which was fun to watch - the guys shucking the oysters take turns peeling off their oystery gloves to get you a drink or pick up your food or drop the check.  I don't know about anyone else, but there is just something about a great big black man with a Southern accent and a big smile that makes me all giggly and, well, girly.

We went with the medium spicy (which was perfect!..we tried a mild as well but that was too plain). Did I mention the chicken pieces are huge?! Dark meat all the way...white was too dry. There were 4 of us and could barely finish 3 baskets.

When I said something, they just shrugged. I didn't have time to argue, so just accepted it, but thought this was very shady. I get my food and walk back to work where I open it.

2dv7J4F9WDUu0fF2PH02ZQ,"The duel of the hot chicken shacks - Prince's or Hattie B's? After trying both, I'd actually lean towards Prince's. Not to take anything away from Hattie B's - the chicken here was good - but I thought Prince's was more flavorful. I'm not sure you can even fairly compare the two. Prince's is more traditional, while Hattie B's (unless they just recently went under a complete renovation) was hip and cool. The chicken (ordered one ""medium"" spice level, and two ""mild"" legs) was good - the medium could've been a bit more spicy, but after almost losing my taste buds on the medium over at Prince's, I was too scared to go for the ""hot"". The parking also really sucks.. luckily, we nabbed one of the couple free spots, but it's a very small narrow strip of spots that could be hard for larger vehicles to get into. You literally have to turn 90 degrees off of a busy road into a spot just wide enough for your car (or so it seemed at the time). Overall, I think Hattie B's is a fine establishment - a more hip and cleaner place to try the infamous hot chicken.",,

2f0z22RLYES9HpR4gp6lhw,"Holy heck, Hattie B's. The hype is legit, and I'll fess up and say that I didn't want to believe it. Who wants to sit on an hour long line for chicken? CHICKEN! Well, my friends and I did, and while the wait was surprisingly pleasant with drinks in hand and enjoyable conversation, what waited inside your packed interior was even better.

I didn't know what to expect except the consumption of this mysterious (but apparently well-known) hot chicken. I've never heard of it before until we made the arrangements to eat at Hattie's, who was famous for it. And my goodness gracious, there's a reason their chicken is famous. It's absolutely effing delicious. DELICIOUS!

I ordered the Shut the Cluck Up, which is the hottest level of spice you can order. Go big or go home, right? I went big, and it paid off. The heat was certainly intense - like, not for the weak of heart, mind, and mouth level of spicy - but what surprised me was how much flavor was present. As hot as it was, it was just as delicious. The chicken was moist on the side and crispy on the outside. You could feel the punch of the spice and every ounce of flavor of it, as well. I thought ordering a side of fries and mac and cheese would help soothe the mouth and throat, but why stop at making the chicken spicy? The fries had a hot dusting on top, and I'm pretty sure there were jalapeños in the mac and cheese. Delicious joke on me!

Moral of the story: give in to the hot hype of Hattie B's. They're proof that chicken isn't just chicken.",,
2f1KsjjTGcJRciyTjM66nw,,First time in new Orleans and I gotta say the oysters here were awesome and the service was just as amazing.  You gotta try the charbroiled oysters and raw. The atmosphere is great I love how busy it is just makes the place that much better.,
2f2tjenL-jWf0TajBnImVg,,,"Love it! Myself and another person ordered for delivery from the hotel we were staying at. I was a bit nervous due to other people's complaints of their food not being delivered on time, missing parts of their order, food gone cold, etc. but we lucked out as it was midnight but our food got delivered to our hotel just 30 min after being placed.

Food wise, I definitely recommend the crab cakes. The sauce it came with was full of crawfish tails! (yum!). My boyfriend got the Cajun jambalaya pasta and that dish was delicious as well. I tried crawfish etoufee for the first time and really enjoyed it. 

I recommend dining in-house if you can to avoid the messy food deliveries. My one complaint is that although they tried wrapping the togo boxes in plastic wrap, the sauces still got shuffled around when our food was delivered and it sort of made a mess. I wish they were a bit more careful in handling our food during the delivery process."

2fGKTLhrvlofTildkl5AsQ,,"So there's always a wait. Always. This is just something you have to work with in order to eat here. We've only had to wait about 25 minutes at the most. My husband would probably wait hours, he loves the chargrilled oysters that much. I like the fried shrimp and the crab cakes. We've eaten here three times over the past year and have always sat at the bar. If there's only two in your party, it totally works and the people behind the bar are pretty entertaining.",The food is always tasty (even breakfast!) But something else that I think is noteworthy is that the service has always been exceptional. I've eaten here five times over the past year for different meals of the day. There's plenty of seating in a comfortable atmosphere and the people are awesome.

The waitress we had was really short with us and was too intent on spitting out all of the information she had to tell us and would reprimand us by staring us down if she was talking and we were too...a little weird but not mean :)

I would go back for sure!"

2fkip302QfGdXuKtbdhl7A,,,the food was amazing. Staff was friendly and very helpful. I ordered the seafood platter and it was delicious. I will come definitely come back and be sure to let my friends and family know about this place. I ate here once before when it was the older restaurant so this place has def upgraded and came along way. I would recommend this to anyone who would like something new that tastes great and don't want to be let down.
2fprIzUck86rv2mBQVETFQ,,,So walked around for an hour to find this place. The locals suggested it as if it were the best place for seafood. I wanted pasta but there weren't a ton of options. I stuck with the Cajun pasta and added a crab cake for an additional $5 which was actually pretty good. We also

Only complaint is the bloody marys are a bit salty due to being infused in the pickled vegetables. 

Overall, everything was delicious and we will come back everytime we come in town to NOLA."

Went with a buddy for a quick dinner before we hit the bars....big mistake...lines out the door but got 2 seats at the bar which was fine.  Raw oysters plus oysters grilled.  I love raw oysters and the difference is the the SIDES they provide.  Adequate but I won't be back.  Look at my profile for a preferred place which I will not mention on this review.

Why line up when you can walk into other places that exceed Acme !!  That is the thought I leave you with !","Love this place....love the food, love the friendly staff and love the extras they give if you ask.

Had raw oysters here on my trip and fell in love....lots of side sauces, hot, medium, a couple types of horse radish...love it !!  And great prices and never a lineup...just on a side street off the ""Quarter""..look for it...embrace it...love it.

I will not go to New Orleans without a visit here...such friendly people.  Started a conversation with one of the staff indicating I was going on hurricane tours and she offered me an inside view of the devastation with the provision we had to get out before dark.  Great tour guide and earned herself some tips and drinks for that !  Who could ask for better service !

Had the oysters and on other occasions the gumbo, crawdads and more !  For me, good food is great but when accompanied by good service...PRICELESS...."

Soon as I walked in I could smell the spices, got some hot chicken, and it was AMAZING!! Juicy, succulent, crispy, and spicy. This was my 3rd time dining here and I figured it was time to give a review. All three times have been great. Chicken is always fresh and tasty.

I was not disappointed one bit. Chicken was amazing and delicious. Cooked perfectly. It was not greasy at all. Their sides should get just as high of praise. 

I got southern dark chicken, mac and cheese and potato salad. My fiancé got the mild white meat chicken with coleslaw with mac and cheese.

We came during the dinner rush. There were 13 of us, we waited in line for maybe 30 min not too long. And by the time we ordered our food tables opened up right next to each other.

Food came out quickly and service was great. Definitely recommended the banana pudding and sweet tea!

There are other places in town that claim to be older or more authentic but Hattie B's is just a better all-around experience.  The chicken is GOOD and there is actually a range in their levels of spicy.  Medium is nice and right in the middle but I prefer the Hot! It's spicy but you can still taste how delicious the chicken is.  They have great sides too but it's really just all about that hot chicken, white bread, and pickle. 
It will be crowded during lunch and on weekends so plan ahead but it's well worth it!",,

Just do yourself a favor and remember that HOT chicken is, in fact, hot. If you're sensitive to spices, take me at my word (and painful experiences) and order the mild sauce. And then be sure to chow down on their lovely patio space.",,

From the start the staff were super sweet and welcoming, the place was nice and clean and had tons of seating but you weren't on top of one another.

The craw puppies are such a great guilty pleasure! Fried to a perfect crisp and loaded with flavor and just the right amount of spice.
The famous fried oyster & shrimp po boy was also delicious. The bread was soft and the oysters, like the craw puppies, were fried perfectly.
We also ordered a side of jambalaya. It had a great smoky flavor and the long grain rice was fragrant.

Fantastic service from our server Jamal but the hostess didn't smile when we walked in and just seemed like she didn't want to be there, resting B****face all the way.

It had a hot caramel sauce on top. Damn good.

We found this on Yelp while in town for one night.  Thanks Yelp.",

Please tip them well! Oh yeah, it's a little cold in there so bring a light weight jacket if you do not like the feel of cool air. Me myself loved it!

Now honestly speaking I have seen this place on TV quite a few times and felt this was a must visit place on my NOLA visit. The Raw Oysters on the shell I had were were good. My mom had the Shrimp platter and she liked it. My dad had the fried oyster platter and he liked it. I can't remember the name of my wife's dish, fish with crab and veggies and it was just alright. Now my dish....I ordered the shrimp Po-Boy. Sadly, half of my sandwich was damn near empty of shrimp, the bread was definitely not fresh....felt like some old bread that they tried to cover by toasting it. The order does not come with anything else so I had to order a side of fries that were more on the soft soggy side then crisp.

So to sum it up, where's I was expecting to have my socks blown off due to the television hype, I was left a little disappointed. Not that great. average at best!",
2hsI1Kgm2_yGgl2dfoweJA,,I thought this is a tourist trap but it was not. The grilled oysters were great. Prices are reasonable for the quality received. Fun as the atmosphere and great service. You may want to get there early as the lines get huge in later in the day/early evening.,

The end of the line is close to the sidewalk. From there it was another 20 minutes or so before I got to order. The cashier was friendly and helpful. I ordered a small dark, with hot spice level, which she described as jalapeno like. I chose mac and cheese and collard greens as sides. 

There are only a few tables inside (all taken), so I find a spot outside. It's covered so you don't have to worry too much about the sun. I grabbed a spot. The table surface hadn't been wiped down and it needed a new paper towel. Boo.

My food comes out and the waitress sees the paper towel roll and replenishes it. Now, to the food.
- Chicken at hot spice: not much heat to it. It's more mild per my normal heat tolerance tastebuds. The bread to soak things up helped with the grease. For fried chicken, it didn't taste well floured and fried. Just basic.
- Pimento cheese mac and cheese: Lovely! Creamy and mild hint of spice. 
- Collard greens: good flavor, with some meat cooked with it.

The mess did damper the experience. I was careful leaving as the floors were slippery. I almost was taken out twice.",,

We went in a big group and were seated in the upstairs area, which has a nice ambiance on sunny days. For appetizers we got the oysters, which were quite good. The rest of the meal was average at best. Except for the crabcakes and blackened fish, we didn't really like any of the entrees. My etouffee didn't have any fish in it at all! Never seen a place where the fish in a ""crawfish etouffee"" was a $5 optional extra, and the gravy and rice (which they gave me) cost $17. And our desserts seemed to be taken straight out of the fridge - the pecan pie and creme brulee were both served dead cold.

One last thing - 3 people in our group of 12 started feeling queasy in the afternoon/evening after our lunch. My wife had to skip dinner to avoid throwing up. So maybe some of that seafood isn't of the highest quality."

It's got a buzzing bar-like atmosphere, and can tend to be fairly busy.  Service is inconsistent.

I usually get the Shrimp or Oyster Po-Boy, which are good.  Their gumbo poopa is unique (gumbo in a bread bowl), and relatively good.  There's nothing really healthy (and tasty) on the menu; if you are looking for a salad or grilled (not fried) meat or seafood, try elsewhere.",

1. I went inside to ask someone at the counter about parking (which is limited). The place was poppin' but he was patient and happy to warn me not to park on the wrong side of the road so as not to get ticketed!! 
2. I very confidently ordered the tenders--2 of the hottest spice level (shut the cluck up), and 1 mild. They accidentally brought out three of the shut the cluck ups and I couldn't handle it LOL. I went up to correct the mishap and they gave me my mild tender!! I just scraped off the super hot spice to the best of my ability and vowed never to get the spiciest thing at a restaurant again without knowing I could handle it.

The flavors of all 3 were outstanding and never knew Red beans and Rice could taste so good- The Andouille sausage strip added to the yummy dish......

Didn't have much time to enjoy so we ended up with the Chicken Tenders, I got the Hot and my wife the medium.  The flavor was great in the breading, but the Chicken seemed to be just a little on the dry end.  Still tasted good, probably should've gotten a blue cheese dipper.  The Baked beans were upper tier, and the pimento Mac and Cheese is a must.  I'm sure my usual dark meat selection would've been done perfectly.

Their oysters are caught in 1/2 salt water and 1/2 fresh water. This is why each bite is so fresh, clean, and does not taste salty. I loved their fried oysters, Chargrilled Oysters, and the Crawfish. I'm on seafood fix -- and I expect to eat here again tomorrow! One of the best ideas is to eat osyters and crawfish in season. I highly expect myself to eat here again tomorrow. This is a must stop in NOLA!",Huge fan of the po-boy fried oysters and the crab cakes! I tried the gumbo and there was nothing to special about that. I loveeeee the crab cakes! It was decent sized and I could have ate the whole plate to myself if I wasn't sharing. The po-boy was a great size and good to share between 2-3 people! I hear the oysters come from Acme so that's why they tasted so good!

I was recently visiting New Orleans on a service trip for my employer's spring break. We were recommended to go to Oceana and it did not disappoint. If you have a large party, definitely make a reservation online, even though there are 3-4 large dining rooms. Also outdoor/courtyard seating as well. 

We each got something different at the table, but all really enjoyed the gator bites with remoulade sauce to dip! Entrees are big, so come with an appetite! Drinks (as with anywhere in NOLA) are expensive, even if you get a virgin cocktail."

We ordered the Fried Eggplant appetizer, Fried Catfish Po'boy, Pimm's Cup, and Bloody Mary. Shortly after eating here we both felt sick and assume it was caused by what we ate at this restaurant. I recommend eating somewhere else in the area. There are about 3 vegetarian options on the menu. We didn't get to try any dessert. The menu prices seem high for the quality of food you receive."

The medium spiced chicken tenders were definitely all the spice I needed. There are 2 more heat levels above that but, medium gave me all I could handle. Their chicken is honestly quite good. Pimento Mac & Cheese and coleslaw were my 2 sides of choice and neither excited very much. The chicken is definitely the star.

Also, their cocktail sauce is super spicy with plenty of horseradish.  Mmmm, wish I live in New Orleans!","Nice enough place but in my opinion nothing very special. Typical of some of the other New Orleans deep-fried venues, but nothing that made this place stand out.  We started off with a few appetizers, the alligator bites were in little tiny pieces, and the raw oysters were dry and a little off-tasting.  For dinner I had the fried oyster Po boy, it had good flavor but not very many oysters, and the gumbo that came with it was on the bland side. The best part of the meal may have been the desserts. We got Bananas Foster, crème brûlée, and bread pudding to share, they were all very tasty.

Luckily for me, I didn't have to wait.. yes there was a line, but apparently the door guy pointed at me next and I was too hungry to be humble and wait.. so in I went.  The place is kind of a divey looking pub, and you will have a bunch of tourists in there.. I'm sure I looked like one since I had my phone out snapping pictures :)

The raw oysters: Full disclosure, I absolutely loveee oysters! When I saw the Man vs. Food episode where Adam Richman put away 15 dozen oysters at ACME, I was so excited because I think I could do it.  However, since I came here with colleagues, I had to be settle and just do 2 dozen by myself. These oysters are clean, light, and just a bit of saltiness to them.  They really flavor well and didn't even add lemon or any sauce.

The Chargrilled oysters: I didn't think I would like these, as I don't like cooked oysters.. but everyone was doing them and they were highly rated.. so why not? Oh man! THESE WERE DELISH! A bit on the heavy side since they were just pure garlic, butter, parsley and Parmesan cheese.. but oh boy were these amazing! They were perfectly cooked where the toppings just browned a bit, but the oyster still had a raw texture! Dip some bread and you are good!

My first experience was awesome and the food killer. The second time? Disgusting and I stopped sending customers here. I knew Gordon Ramsey had been here earlier this year and considering I  refused to send people here before, I decided to give them another chance.  It's obvious that they have chosen to follow none of Gordon's advice.  The inside is still dirty and dank and I opted for the courtyard. The ""ice cream parlor"" chairs in the courtyard were horribly uncomfortable, ugly and offered no ambiance to this otherwise awesome courtyard.  Maybe it was a subconscious way of the owner telling customers to get the hell out. This is obviously a place that makes it's money by turn and burn. I ordered the Redfish Oceana and at least I got a piece of redfish. It was however, breaded as a previous review noted. The sauce had crawfish tails in it that were previously frozen and came out a nasty grey color on my plate. Ick...I'm not eating those so I picked them off. Otherwise the redfish was ok.  The fried eggplant appetizer was pretty good. The big problem?, the menu is way overpriced for the style of food. $20 for the redfish and $8.50 for fried eggplant.  This isn't Palace Cafe after all. All and all, I still wouldn't send customers here. I wonder how long it will take these people to figure out that you cannot survive on tourists alone, especially when they are savvy food bloggers.

The hostess was friendly and accommodating,  my waitress (Kim) was also as friendly and very helpful in explaining all the wonderful dishes listed on the menu. At her recommendation, I ordered the Blackened Redfish LaFouche.  It was better than her description!!! I was very satisfied with both the wonderful flavors as well as the portion size. I also had a hurricane that was the best I have ever had. I will definitely be back and will recommend this fine establishment to anyone who asks. Thank you for a wonderful culinary experience!!!"
2s27wyX1hn2lL1jv5Sn36w,,,"After spending most of our night on Bourbon street, my group decided to stop in and grab something to eat. Our attention was caught by the menu that was placed outside. There seemed to be a lot of good things to choose from and so we decided to get a table. We were taken upstairs and got a table in the corner. Our server was either very inexperienced or just impatient because she kept rushing us. We were a party of 10 people and we needed time to look over the menu. She acted very rude and we didn't like it. 

BLACKENED BAYOU DUCK- Smoked duck then blackened and topped with a crawfish mushroom cream sauce
This dish was very good and flavorful. It was packed with different spices and had many layers of flavors. The duck was beautifully cooked. It was tender and juicy and I absolutely love the mushroom cream sauce. It had a nice thick consistency and was so creamy.

SURF AND TURF
This dish was okay. The beef was cooked nicely and had some nice flavors, but it wasn't as flavorful as the other dish. The oyster was friend and was a bit too dry for my taste.

BANANAS FOSTER ICE CREAM CAKE- with caramel, strawberries and chocolate
I really like the moist cake and the fruity strawberries and the rich chocolate. It was a nice way to the end the meal with something cold, but sweet.

NEW ORLEANS BREAD PUDDING- with praline and rum sauce
This bread pudding was very moist and I love the rum. It had a nice sweet alcohol taste to it and tasted very nicely with the sweetness of the dessert.

Overall, I would come here again, but I would definitely pass if I end up with the same server. I really like some of their dishes and I taste the complexity of the layers of flavors; so I hope to try other dishes like those."

I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and the Seafood Gumbo, to go! The delivery time was so fast. They delivered to the lobby of my hotel within 20 minutes of ordering. The food was still hot, and the Shrimp Po Boy still crispy.

Next time, I would love to dine in to get the experience - and try out the other menu options."

I asked the concierge for recommendations and she gave me a couple. Oceana was the one I decided on. It was a delivery order. I ordered after a few minutes of waiting on the phone. The employee who took my order was friendly and efficient. 
The delivery person was a little confused on my room number but it's a large hotel so I can forgive that. When I met the delivery person he was friendly and offered his opinion on the food after a good natured ribbing about the food being good. He laughed and said blacked gator was his favorite.
The roll was nice and soft, chewy but not in a bad way. The gator was firm but not chewy as I am told it can be. The fried were fries, crispy nicely seasoned but nothing outstanding. 
The Crawfish was great! Nice level of spice a little chewy but nothing I haven't been told about.
Overall it was good. I would definitely recommend, and eat again"

The best bet is to sit at the bar.  You'll get to see the professional oyster shuckers in action and even though they're working with a sharp object at a feverish pace, their service is superb.  I muttered my order to bf to help him decide what to order and before you know it, my dozen fresh oysters, Abita beer, and etouffe was placed in front of me.  The server tells me, I start working on your order as soon as you say it - he wasn't kidding.

The fresh oysters were delish and the grilled oysters were crazy good.  The raw ones were pillowly rich and the grilled ones were ooey gooey rich.  We ordered dozen after dozen.  I really enjoyed sitting at the bar because of the interaction with the staff.  They're friendly and they tell you things like they're been shucking oysters for 37 years, it hurts like a beeotch if you cut yourself with the shucking knife, the oysters are farm raised in the gulf, and watch out for the pearls in the oysters.

This will definitely be one of my road to gluttony stops next time I'm in town.",

The line also seems to take forever but once you have that first bite, all will be right and delicious. The chicken has the perfect spice, crisp and tenderness. The mac and cheese and potato salad were also so on point and all went perfectly together. I've never had more delicious fried chicken and I'm so glad to finally check Nashville hot chicken off the list of things to try. Yes you'll find it on menus everywhere but nothing beats the real thing in Nashville. Hattie B's definitely delivers in the best way.",,"This was such a great find for our continued search for all that is creole. Tucked away down a little side street, kept the hustle and bustle away. We were seated right away. Our server was very prompt and efficient. The taste of New Orleans gave us a little bit of everything but we also had to  get the oysters Rockefeller and gumbo. Everything was so good and super flavorful. The vibe was super low key which is always nice. Definitely a good find!"

Breakfast is served until 1 pm on weekdays - WHAT A BLESSING for those of us who want to sleep in. Our group of 4 ordered the pancakes, seafood omelette, country breakfast, and the lost bread (aka a special version of French toast). My oh my everything was delicious, particularly the French toast and the complimentary hash brown, which has a nice spicy kick! Unlike most breakfast/brunch restaurants, where you have to choose between savory and sweet options, Oceana allows you to do both! Both the French toast entree and the pancake entree came with a complimentary side of bacon or sausage. We were completely stuffed and amazed at how great of a deal it was for the quantity of food.

And the service was extremely friendly and attentive. I couldn't have asked for a better way to start my morning!"

Both were pretty good, but I preferred the blackened since the fried ones were really overwhelmed by the batter. It came with a yummy dipping sauce. However, it was really pricey. It was like 10 chunks for $11. Not really worth it.

Fiance had the gumbo, which was pretty good."

The food is okay, nothing special, just your regular mediocre chain-like food: fried, tons of butter/sauce and likely over cooked. The blacked Cajun flavor is there, but still nothing special, just the store-bought Cajun spice.

When my meal came it was mostly bread. There were 9 small blackened shrimp on the sandwich (popcorn size) when the photo in the menu showed it overflowing with shrimp. The french fries were excellent but I asked for mayo to dip them in and didn't receive the mayor until we asked the server a second time. This wouldn't have been a problem except we didn't see our server until the very end of the meal (about 30 mins later). The fries were cold by then. The sandwich was soggy. I left the restaurant hungry. 

My boyfriend ordered red fish which was good but not great. Everything was very over priced and the service was extremely lacking."

If you don't mind the wait, definitely go here for your Nashville hot chicken experience.",,

Two friends wished they had shared fried oyster platter because it was so much food."
2wRXTaklBZcnivCUB_MEuA,We waited more than an hour. But it was worth it! The hot chicken was probably the best fried chicken I've ever had.  The side dishes are not impressive but good enough. I had the breast wing combo with baked beans and coleslaw. I suggest ordering online and pick up instead of waiting on line.  But eat the chicken quickly so that it doesn't get soggy.,,

Raw oysters - I had just come from Houston (and devoured ultra fresh and ice cold blue point oysters) and the oysters here did not compare, they were good but meh...maybe I should have got the charbroiled oysters!

Soft shell crab - I love soft shelled crab, these were huge and very good! But a little on the saltier side.

Fried shrimp and crab corn chowder - fried shrimp/seafood tasted like frozen, but the chowder was sooo good! Honestly I enjoyed the chowder the most. 

Maybe I was too hyped up and expected nothing but the best here? In my opinion nothing stood out and left me wanting to come back for more.",

Each and every meal was delicious, but Acme was so great, and such a good value (much-needed after a great Cochon dinner), that we came twice in 36 hours!!

Fresh oysters, oysters rockefeller, barbequed oysters, garlic parmesan oysters, boo fries, chowder, Abita, whiskey -- so good, I'm still thinking about these meals, two years later.",
2y-8ZpztPiulTj8sbTiEsw,,"We heard this restaurant from our Hotel Concierge. Since it was highly recommended, we decided to check it out for dinner before hitting Bourbon St. 
We ordered Abita local brew (Amber & Turbodog). They served the brews in a small Solo clear cup fr $3.75. Disappointed! Then my boyfriend ordered a bowl of Seafood Gumbo (shrimp & crab rice) $6.99. Very disappointed! The bowl was really a cup! I ordered the Fried Peace Maker po boy (golden fried oysters & shrimp seasoned to perfection with Tabasco infused mayo) for $10.99. It was okay! Our first visit to this place, it was a disappointment because we've already checked out local Seafood restaurants in the area that were much better for your buck!  
Our second visit was at the airport, we were waiting for our flight home to Southern California. We decided to eat lunch at the ACME airport location since all the other food restaurants were closed. We tried $4 seven hush puppies and a dozen oysters (6 char-grilled & 6 raw oysters). WICKEDLY expensive! but that's expected at the airport. Not worth it!",
2y-p33Fv0fcnqeFoTEO79w,,"Came here in early afternoon and there wa34s no  wait. Every other time there was a long line outside. The oysters were cold, fresh and tasty but had a bit of grit. I actually found a tiny pearl in one!  Not too salty. And $16 a dozen is a good price around here. The lights are dim, tables  covered  with black and white checked table clothes...my wife says ""Typical Oyster house Atmosphere."" The is an oyster shucking station as you walk in with a mirror angled over it to watch the shucking, then a regular bar then a frying station and then an oyster grilling station so as you walk through you see your food being prepared. Very appetizing. We had raw oysters but the grill ones looked and smell great. Next time. The service was good;  friendly and accommodating but they forgot our oysters and needed reminding. The seafood gumbo was disappointing: very little seafood, a huge mound of rice and little flavor. I actually had to add Tabasco to it, not a common occurrence with gumbo. The seafood Etouffee was much better especially after we added the fried crayfish tails for an extra charge. Over all worth another visit to try the grilled oysters if we can get in with minimal waiting. Otherwise I will cross the street to Felix's which dosn't have a line.",

What a treat! The fries were crispy and seasoned well, and the chicken was off the chain. Great service, too! My only reason for 4 stars is the bread on the sandwich tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile, and I wanted more sauce. Otherwise, total hit. Would definitely go back!"

Don't get me wrong, it was ok, not bad, but certainly not worthy of being a deliberate stop on my tour by the tour company.  I got the chicken tenders (medium hot), fries, greens, and coleslaw.  It was just ok, nothing fancy and nothing so good that I would make a deliberate effort to come back.  Other than being hot, the chicken lacks flavor.  The pimento mac and cheese looked so runny on the plates of other patrons, I dare not try it, because real mac and cheese is baked in the oven.  Don't get me wrong, it's good, the chicken had a nice crisp on it and the greens were good, I just don't understand all the hype.  The tour guide said sometimes the line is so long people have waited two hours to get in - really???
It's good, but don't expect it to knock your socks off.  It's as good as any other fried chicken restaurant like Popeyes or Kentucky Fried.",,

My friends and I were debating on Hattie's or Prince's, and were torn. When someone said Prince's was about 20+ minutes and the sides were better at Hattie's, we decided to go for convenience. 

We arrived 30 minutes before it opened, and there was already a line. Be prepared to wait, but it is totally worth it. Service is friendly and fast, and prices are totally reasonable. 

My friends and I got a whole bunch of items to try. Most notably the hot chicken sammich, dark meat platter, mac and cheese, potato salad, fries, and banana pudding. 

I would say the sandwich and the fries were my favorite bites. Sandwich is so juicy, and the potato bun works so well with the heat and cool cole slaw. Fries are seasoned nicely, reminded me of Old Bay seasoning. 

My friends and I all agreed this place was the highlight of our weekend! Would definitely try Prince's if I'm ever back in Nashville though.",,

2zU9z4EpDAfsmBO9FN-F-A,"Quite the experience here yesterday. One of us waited (in the rain) on a line that was snaking around the corner while the other one waited in the car with our napping daughter. Total wait time was 45 minutes, so not too bad as far as these things go. 

We ordered the ""southern"" chicken tenders for the kiddo and we split a half-chicken ""hot"" with a few sides. The chicken is indeed nice and spicy--more like a tingling hotness than a burning death--and was well-seasoned. Our only complaint is that almost all of the skin fell off after cutting into it or taking a bite. Good fried chicken skin stays on! We liked all the sides we got as well, especially the black-eyed peas which were served as a cold salad and were fun to be eating on NYE. Fries, pimento mac and cheese, and cooked greens were also solid.

Service is really friendly and everyone working there is hustling. The reason we're giving Hattie B's 3 stars instead of 4 is because of the logistical nightmare that happened 30 minutes after we sat down. Since they were closing early at 4:00 pm, everyone waiting on line was invited into the restaurant for to-go orders. The space is tight enough to begin with before you let a bunch of hangry people in who are then hovering above the dining patrons trying to eat their meal in peace. We left quickly after that, and even though it left a sour taste in our mouths, we're still glad that we tried this Nashville hotspot.","Food: 4-5 stars; Service: 1-2 stars.

We came here early evening naively thinking that it would be quiet around 4:30 pm since it's only indoor seating. Not so much. There are fewer tables and  they are spaced out but almost all of them were full. We chose one at the end of the first room so we only had to contend with one other table across from us, but still. Staff ranged from wearing their masks to the dick nose to a couple guys in the kitchen wearing none at all. It didn't help anything that there was a NOLA-KC football game on the TV and folks were REALLY riled up.

Our server took one look at us and immediately decided to hate us. Either that or he hates his life because we didn't exactly see him laying on the charm with the other table by us. He sucked--wasn't on top of orders and had a major attitude the whole time. We still tipped him well but geez, what a sour puss.

Now that the negative stuff is out of the way, we want to emphasize that we had a delicious meal here. We started with the chargrilled oysters and the New Orleans Medley. The oysters had a delicious sauce on them and even our three year old ate a couple of them. We loved everything on the medley, but the grilled sausage and jambalaya were the best (kiddo favored the rice and beans). We all split the fried seafood platter, and again, everything was excellent, though the platter would have benefited from some post-frying salt sprinkling. The catfish was particularly wonderful. The pecan cobbler for dessert was the only disappointment: it's essentially just pecan pie filling in a martini glass with a super hard scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

We're settling on four stars despite the bad service and flouting of Covid measures. On the one hand, we got to go here without having to wait 1-2 hours (which is how it would usually be), but on the other hand, we felt pretty tense about the whole indoor dining thing the whole time even though we were vigilant about wearing our masks. Time will tell whether or not we have any legitimate regrets, but for now we're happy that we got to experience such a NOLA institution.",
2zhTsvYOEPQaQP9w53zkvA,,"A tourist site with the soul of a TGI Friday's. We had a couple Peacemaker Po' Boys, but apparently the shrimp were enforcing peace through total domination of the oysters. One of the sandwiches had nary a single oyster on an entire half. Bread was so so. 
Actually had a much better Po' at the Royal House, where they also have great chargrilled oysters. 
ACME's are OK, but they have too much cheese on them. Folks inside Acme were very nice and efficient, but the line guardian pissed us off. We were four, it was raining, and one person was sick. She went a half block to the hotel to get a coat and be warm so we could call her when it was our turn to be seated. They wouldn't take us until she was there and kept pulling groups from behind us in line. So she arrived in five minutes and had to wait again in line anyway. I get that you can't just hold empty tables, but that wasn't the case, and we explained nicely. Losers. There are too many places for good oysters (like Drago's) to waste time with Acme's shtick.",

With ""Master Shucker"" engraved on his ACME ball cap, I had a feeling we were in excellent hands and the truth is, we could not have had a better time or been taken care of any better. Hollywood educated us on the local area, how to eat oysters, recommended dishes to try, and of course, we jived as he shucked!

We started with 2 oyster shots, lobster soup (good but not to the level of great) and 1/2 dozen of raw oyster and chargrill oyster. They are so fresh, and the raw oyster is already great (we came from Chicago and it feels like we haven't got chance to have anything so fresh for a long time). Then the chargrill oyster which came with slightly roasted bread is amazing, the source was magic. We even ate all the bread by dipping the source.

I don't know how to describe the oysters but we ordered another dozen of raw oyster and 3 dozen of chargrill oyster for just two of us!!","We are here for dinner, the restaurants has several floors, and it's decorated well with Christmas trees. We order gator tail bites (you can choose half fried half blackened) both are great, it's house special redfish oceana is also great. However the other dishes like taste of NOLA is just ok."
30vjKdW6wNF5i1Hu-6-agA,"That is some spicy chicken!

The wait is a bit long but definitely well worth it. Don't worry that you have to wait because the wait is worth having fresh fried chicken.

The Crisp is amazingly satisfying.

Customer service here is pretty awesome also.

I would say the Chicken needs a smidge of salt.

If you like fried chicken this place is your gig. Come here and enjoy.",,
30wAMDC3M5wV8Y606iawiA,"We came late and so the wait was only about half an hour. After trying both Hattie B's and Prince's, we all agreed that Hattie B's lives up to its reputation as the best hot chicken in Nashville. We got the sandwiches and wings, both of which are juicier and more flavorful than the chicken at Prince's. We also tried all of the sides options, which are far better than the relatively dry fries at Prince's.",,
30yek6CmAt5oFh71u0c7GA,,Oysters were amazing and the  Fried fish po-boy sandwich was an excellent choice.,

The blackened shrimp Caesar salad had probably a dozen large sized shrimp and my husband really enjoyed the Taste of New Orleans.

31PJeIkeuMysc9JN95xHgg,,,"The food does not look like the pictures in the menu. I ordered the country breakfast which came with eggs, bacon or sausage, a biscuit, and grits. My scrambled eggs were extremely greasy. The biscuit had a stale/microwaved/chewy taste. Instead of grits i ordered potatoes. The potatoes in the picture were cubed and looked great. They gave me hash browns that weren't crispy at all but the taste was ok. Sausage was super greasy as well. I'm from Houston so I expected this place to be like Babin's or Landry's. At least for the price at Landry's you get decent food. The service was pretty good but the food left something to be desired."

Very busy but a good place to hit up to have authentic hot chicken.,"We waited about 20 minutes to be seated. There is a line before dinner all the way until late night. Very busy and chaotic. Once seated, it is a very vibrant and friendly atmosphere. 
Fantastic charbroiled oysters and the deep fried fish and soft shell crab were mouthwatering. I would come here for sure if I was in the area again. All items were great and service was good. Not a random tourist trap, worth the hype.",
31x_4JV1hGzZ6uJmyUfvKg,,,"The Rockefeller oysters were tasty.  Highly recommend the shrimp jambalaya pasta with alligator sausage.  The sauce was perfectly seasoned without being too salty or spicy.  The special tonight was also delicious, blackened catfish with crayfish and jambalaya.  Had no room for desserts but they looked yummy."
320H1mblckMOQOMnjEmhNg,,"I truly need to find other spots that sell these amazing charboiled oysters. Thats like my next mission when I go back to NOLA, battle of the charboiled. 

Anywho. Only come here for the charboiled oysters it is the only fresh thing on the menu. Im sorry I have been here three times and the other food is lack luster compared to these darn oysters. I should though try the dessert before I write off the rest of the menu. But, I can say this now until next time that the whole establishment is carried on the back of the oysters from my point of view. Lol the drinks here reminded me of ... Let me stop they were not good. Go to bourbon street and get you a drink but your not allowed to brink outside drinks into the establishment. FYI.

Oh some additional stuff: This place usually has a line during busier hours. The wait I would say is from 5 - 30 minutes but it does move and is worth it for the oysters.",

We passed this place a day later and the line was down the block! Had the chargrilled oysters, shrimp & oyster po-boy and seafood étoufée. Everything was delicious and priced fairly for portion size. Service was quick without feeling rushed. Our server, Mike, was super friendly! Overall,an excellent experience!","Waited about 30 minutes for a table on a Saturday (not bad). Sat at the upstairs bar. Had the cajun jambalaya pasta. The sauce was really good, but the protein portion in the dish (shrimp and alligator sausage) was really scant for the price of the dish, so had to drop a few stars for that. Had the bread pudding for dessert & it was delicious."

The chicken sandwich with the medium sauce was great. My niece got it with the slaw on the side instead of on the burger. I don't like hot food so I stuck with their ""Southern"" which is sans the hot sauce. They have chicken & waffles on the weekend so I'll have to go back for that.",,

I was confused because we were handed lunch menus and it was 3. Apparently they do lunch until 4. Sweet!
We started with a BBQ shrimp app. I have only had Deanie's BBQ shrimp so I was unsure they could surpass that. They didn't but it was different in a good way. The sauce was creamier so now I have an alternative. I had a cup of the seafood gumbo and it was so good that I wish I had ordered the bowl. Son had kids chicken tenders and he ate them up quickly. Daughter had shrimp Alfredo. It tasted better than it looked. Hubs really enjoyed the red snapper with potatoes and greens. I did the shrimp po boy. The bread was soft and they put a coleslaw tartar inside that was surprisingly wow! I really wanted to try their bread pudding but alas we were too full. The coolest thing? When I checked in at Yelp it gave us 10% off our meal! Will return."

I'm not one for too much heat in my food so the mild is little to no heat and the medium was a noticeable step up. Ordered the large white breast plate and the chicken tenders.","I highly recommend the Charbroiled Oysters and fried fish and shrimp plate. Anticipate a wait and sometimes a communal dining table when the restaurant is packed, it's not fine dining so all is well!",

We couldn't decide which type of oysters to order. Our waiter allowed us to do half-half of the Oceana's Special and Oysters Rockefeller for same price as a dozen of just one kind.Protip: can't hurt to ask your waiter for a favor, variety deals for the win! We loved both and were glad we got to try both on a deal."

Everyone said this was the best so the whole eight hours I'm driving from Chicago thinking about this chicken, I'm so hungry. I get in line, I wait an hour! I order my chicken half white medium with slaw and Mac. It comes and the meat literally melts off the bone. The heat was perfect for me I could eat it but then my face got hot and tingly. So good. The sides honestly weren't that good. So 4 stars for the long ass wait and the mediocre sides, but if I was coming to Nashville for the first time again I would wait again.... good thing I'm not!",,
348oGoiiDon-W0-1sHacGQ,,,I got the Royal omelette. The crawfish was delicious but the alligator sausage had a weird flavor and yes I've had alligator before. It was too expensive for what I got. It was $18 and came with hashbrown and biscuit. Someone else got the eggplant breakfast  and said the eggplant was extremely strong like it was spoiled almost. I would not return. However someone else got the crawfish etouffee and claimed it was the best she's ever had so if your going to go maybe stick with the lunch/dinner menu and pass on breakfast.

I recommend the Macaroni and pimento's as a side.",,

You still got to watch out for broken shells and sometimes there is excessive sand but that goes with oysters. Make Shure you get some fresh horseradish as the garlic/mayo/horseradish seems a little old and not very horsey. We also had the étouffée which was great and crab corn bisque which was just ok.  The hush puppies were not special either.

They need to work on the seafood etoufee-I've had etoufee in many places, both high-end and cheap, and this might be the worst I've had.  Thin, flavorless sauce.

Really if you come to NOLA you have to find time at the ACME",
365CQcECFOnMZAvRwusTzg,"The chicken is really the star of this place.  It is a very small place with very limited parking.  You do have to wait a while for your food because they make it all to order but it's definitely worth the wait.  The chicken was so tender and breaded just perfectly to compliment the chicken not overpower the chicken and everything was seasoned perfectly.  You get a huge chicken breast and leg with your order.  The sides seem rather mass produced/not homemade - which is surprising since they go to such great lengths to make such delicious chicken.  We specifically went on Sunday to get the chicken and waffles and they had run out of waffles by the time we got there.  We did go about an hour before they closed on super bowl sunday, so I will give them that.  I would definitely go back again - just earlier in the day to make sure I get some waffles with my chicken.",,

You need to irder the full dozen because once you start it's hard to stop. We found our selves scraping the shell for every last morsel... Amazing!!! I also want to recommend the chicken gumbo which was much more flavorful than the seafood one. And to end with a bang you can't pass up the bread pudding which was so rich and oooey and gooey and amazing!!!!,

This time I went for the Damn Hot and I  must admit, it was a TAD bit too hot for me. I swear, last time I got ""Hot"" and wanted it spicer. Maybe the different locations, different days, or my memory are all to blame. Either way, it was delicious. I am still a big fan of the Macaroni, Southern Greens and Baked Beans. My mother tried the potato salad and the cold mayo was a nice relief from the heat. I got a ""Large Dark""-  my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Also, the Banana Pudding was DELICIOUS.

My husband and our (adult) kids were  extremely pleased. We eat out all over the country with husbands field of work and New Orleans is one of our favorite places to try the cuisine. 
The big downfall is because of all the hurricane damage, road issues, etc., it is difficult to get within a block or two by car. In the evenings the roads are blocked off and people are everywhere. My husband dropped me off a block away and had to park almost two blocks away and come find me. Craziness. So, order delivery!! It was still warm when it got here and was delicious."
38zVOHdO02GB3kfc31q2Kw,,"With my first time visiting New Orleans  trying oysters was a must for me. I decided to give Acme Oyster House a try after a friend at home suggested it. Since I wasn't daring enough to try raw oysters I went with the servers suggestion and gave the grilled oysters a try. Boy am I glad I did! First bite is an explosion of flavor that greets your palate with immense surprise. I am in love with that garlicky Parmesan hit to the tongue with the first bite. That sweet fresh oyster subtle pop that just completely compliments the salty parm and garlic. After my half dozen were finished I was yearning for more but I already ordered the Craw Puppies and Etoufee with fried crawfish tails. My order of Craw Puppies were wonderful and yes they are a hush puppy made with a crawfish batter. I rather enjoyed the slightly different softer texture and the little surprise bits of crawfish in them. Now onto my dinner love Etoufee. If you love gumbo you will definitely fall in love with Etoufee. It's lighter in color because it doesn't require that darkened rue but it has a similar seafood base taste that I love oh so much. As per expected the perfectly cooked rice and fried Crawfish added texture and some taste. But nothing compares to that beautiful arrangement of perfectly balanced seafood and spice like Etoufee. I could eat this stuff twice a week and still be craving more, especially from Acme Oyster House.",

You can order ahead via online or simply order at the counter. Little wait which we were pretty pleased. Hattie Bs has been on our list for a very long time as Nashville is home for the Hot Chicken. And lately hot chicken has been the new hot thing. This place definitely did not disappoint. Their hot chicken sandwich was so juicy with a right amount of kick (mild). It came with 1 side which I suggest to get their Mac n cheese or their potatoes. It also came with a side of coleslaw.

I will note that we were in New Orleans for three days, and we kept passing by super long lines at Acme (probably because of the number of conventions in town last week--there were apparently 2 in our hotel alone). We decided to go 10 minutes before their opening at 11, and it worked like a charm.

I was at work so I had a friend pick me up the next to hottest flavor so I wouldn't be suffering. I received the food- I ate one tender. I was DYING.   I went a bought milk to calm my storm.   A co-worker then made fun of me and took a bite. He swallowed the piece and his stomach immediately told him NO and he vomited.    I sat wondering if I was going to be ok.   After having stomach pains worse than child labor, appendicitis, and kidney stones for 1 hr - I bought a gallon of milk and cried to myself.    I contemplated going to the emergency room.             It's the next day and I saw Jesus on the toilet and I now know how Elvis felt during his last hours.       This was not food. This was novelty.

I sat at the bar and the bartender, Pam, was very attentive and very speedy.  The only drawback in this place was the noise, but you are going to have that about anywhere in the French Quarter.

I would give a higher rating if the staff at the entrance didn't try to make us sit at the bar. They told us there was a bit of a wait for tables, but can eat at the bar. I told them we would rather wait for a table. After the 3 of them started murmuring to each other they showed us to a table upstairs. We passed 2 sections full of empty tables, and the section we went into was full of empty tables. Perhaps they think they can get more money out of us trying to make us drink?

Once we finally got inside we were greeted at the counter and I ordered what I came for the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich! I got a side of fries and their homemade lemonade. The space is very small but we found a corner for the two of us and set our table number in plain sight for the waiter. We waited about an additional 10-15 minutes for our food once we were seated. Once our food came we could hardly wait to take a bite! My sandwich was very hot (temperature) but the right amount of spicy for me (medium). Folks, it was the best fried chicken sandwich I have ever had! The pairing of fries and their cold, sweet lemonade were both perfect as well. I finished my meal with a full stomach and beyond satisfied! 

Hattie B's is a MUST eat at spot when you visit Music City! Don't miss out!",,

3DFo6vgjTi-a_XyKQt9paA,,"The Best Event Space in New Orleans!

We hosted our biannual family reunion in New Orleans. We looked at several places and decided upon Acme based on location and menu. We could not have made a better choice! The space had a separate entrance so there was no need to stand in the long line. It was comfortably spacious yet intimate for our 60 person party. The second floor balcony was perfect for people watching and the room was beautifully decorated. 

The food and service were perfect. The Sales manager patiently worked with us on pre-planning calls and was on-site for the majority of the event. The bar service was attentive and the catering staff ensured we had fresh food as needed. My family is STILL talking about how much fun they had and how tasty the food was. I highly recommend selecting this venue for any event - social, corporate or reception. The cost was worth every penny plus some! THANK YOU ACME OYSTER HOUSE!!!!",
3DQqtSD3hoX-HU8dDyvrwg,"Being from VA, I have had some pretty good fried chicken before. When I tell you that no fried chicken I have ever had compares to Hattie B's, I mean it! This chicken was everything that fried chicken should be. It was moist, flavorful, crunchy, and spicy all at the same time. I got the three piece jumbo tenders with 3 sides for $9.50!!! That is the best deal I have seen in a long time. It ended up being two meals! I decided to get the medium heat which was crazy hot for my untrained mouth. Next time I will stick with the mild because everything was spicy. For the sides I got the mac and cheese, fries, and baked beans. All of which were fantastic. I also got a sweet tea and an apple cobbler which was insanely good. If I had been in Nashville longer, I would have eaten here multiple times because it was incredibly reasonable and the food is amazing. The only downfall is the long wait, but that is because everyone else wants to get the best chicken they have ever tasted as well!",,
3DST2Nm6__WLhCSfviqpKQ,,,Love the food here. Bayou pasta was amazing. I love the service; waiter was very nice and gave some really good recommendations. Char grilled oysters were ok.
3DYLC4ZCEb4i_-xRugurZQ,,I was very excited to try this place as it was highly recommended by a few folks. I was disappointed to say the least. The chargrilled oysters contained tiny pieces of oyster shell which you constantly had to spit out when your trying to enjoy the oysters. Even though i enjoyed the taste of the oysters ...This was not a good experience. I also had the crab and corn bisque  which was their soup of the day. The food took an extremely long time to come out - soup included. I don't think I would come back here. I'd much rather go to Drago and have their chargrilled oysters which were extremely yummy with NO shards of shell or try Felix across the street.,

The food was good and the service was great. I would have preferred more options on the menu but aside from that I was satisfied and my friends were too. If I'm not mistaken, the restrooms could use some help, it sort of bugs me when restaurants have poorly maintained restrooms. Aside from that I enjoyed my BBQ shrimp, I could see myself eating there again."

Chargrilled oysters: butter and garlic heaven, an absolute must. Enough said. 

Alligator bites: we got half-and-half and personally I prefer to kind with the smoked seasoning. The fried ones tasted like popcorn chicken but both we're still good.

Jambalaya pasta: really amazing! It had bits of alligator sausage, crawfish, and was very saucy. The portion size was also very filling and the perfect amount for one person."

The service was great!!!! Now this is no exaggeration. We were greeted in the way in, once we reached the top of the stairs, at the table, by our waitress, food runners, and by the host and door greeters on the way out. I just loved the southern hospitality. 

We also tried alligator for the first time and it was very good and not what i expected. All in all my experience was amazing and this place is a 5/5 Hands down. If i could give it a 10 i would! Don't cheat yourself by not visiting Oceana while in NOLA!"

Classical tourist trap, I hope other would read my review before try this place. This place needed serious remodeling or at least good cleaning service. Out of three chandelier around our table two had different light bulb plafons and the third one with missing plafon. But the worse part is service and food. I never see before waitress who would walk away from you when you complaining about food quality. 1. Cap Rock Soup $5.49 - too much salt, not good. 2. Gumbo Poopa $11.99 - average taste. 3. Seafood Platter $20.25 - absolutely disgusting, fried shrimp has strong smell of sewer water, oysters was OK, and fried fish was actually good. But again, those shrimps was very, very bad. Even if you decided to visit this place, stay away from Seafood Platter.
Did I mention that this place artificially building the line when there are not enough people outside? Few empty tables was vacant for 10-15 minutes while waiting line outside of ACME was growing.",
3F2c-JFRK58dfsjdvaUlNQ,"One of my favourite hot chicken places in Nashville. The chicken here is so addicting you will probably be back every few weeks (at least that's been the case for me). I've dined at the restaurant, placed Ubereats orders, and placed pickup orders.

Overall the chicken is delicious and very tender. I have no clue what Hattie B's uses in their spices but WOW this is some spicy chicken. I would recommend beginners to start off with the medium spice level and work your way up over the next few months. I tried to eat a chicken tender that was at the ""hot"" level when I first had Hattie B's and tears came out. After many weeks of slowing moving up the spice ladder I can finally do ""damn hot"" without any tears.

I took off one star for the delivery and pickup services as I often notice the chicken is a lot more greasy when ordered through these channels. The spices are also less distributed giving the chicken some weird flavours. The store also forgot a honey mustard sauce that I ordered but this is not a major issue since the chicken was good.

If you are dining in store, be prepared to wait in line for at least half an hour but it'll be worth it! I recommend going with a large group of friends that way you can all catch up and chat while waiting in line.

Overall, Hattie B's is a must visit if you are in Nashville! Just make sure to bring some tissue boxes in case the spices bring out your tears.",,

3FGVRGOY4x1ra8xOH9HqiQ,,"New Orleans Birthday Trip = Eating in the French Quarter

Acme's an institution. It's got everything you could really want in a fast casual dining experience, but you go for the oysters. You always go for the oysters, even if you don't like them, you eat them, because it's Acme and that's just what you do.

Food:
Oysters!!! I love them, and how can you not? These big ol' things are plucked outta the water and shucked in what I can only guess to be moments before they're slapped on a tray and served for you. Fresh seafood's always the best and you can't beat this freshness when you're so close to the bayou.

To eat oysters: Add lemon, add sauce, slurp, repeat. Drink Abita and order more when you're done, of both.

We also got the combo platter of gumbo, jambalaya and red beans and rice. The jambalaya was goooooood, not quite spicy enough but delicious none the less. The gumbo was eh, not so much, and the rice was under cooked while the beans were overdone. 

I love the oysters, but let's face it, this isn't 5 star dining. Even with the Bourbon St atmosphere (read: borderline drunk and disorderly) institutions should still be given their rightful stars. 3 for you, Acme, you're food rocks, and you'll live long and prosper, but you're still as touristy as they come.

Venue:
True to form, after drinking at HoB we lined up outside Acme and only had to wait for about 5 minutes before we were called in off the line. Don't let the line wrapping around the block intimidate you, you're going to get in quicker than you think.

There's seating for well over 100 here easy, but the goal is to have each table turned over in under 30 minutes, so no dallying. The tables are red and white checkerclothed and the plates are a step above paper, but it's what you came in for, so don't scoff. If you're looking for upscale oysters with little forks and caviar, then go next door to the big gold and leather, white table cloth establishment known as the Bourbon House and get price gouged. But you know, it's your call.",
3FHwyzBuZmfmc7O7y72N0g,,"Best meal we had while at New Orleans, and it was not even the most expensive.

Sitting at the raw bar chatting with Melvin as he shucks oysters is just part of the whole New Orleans experience.  The raw oysters were fresh, decent sized and full of flavor.  The grilled oysters were a strong choice too.  The traditional Oyster Po Boy was good - not great.  The oysters tasted great but the sandwich was lacking overall flavor probably bc there was barely any sauce on the sandwich.

Just a few feet off famous Bourbon street, Acme Oyster House is a dark ""dive bar"" kinda place that's always packed where you can get a good meal.

TIP - after you've tried a couple of the Grilled Oysters, have a few with the TABASCO Brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce on them - it adds a nice smokey flavor to them.",

After finishing dinner, our trip organizer tried to negotiate a discrepancy in the bill. I then watched in absolute shock as the owner threw a temper-tantrum and threatened our group -imagine 120 young professionals dressed in suits and visiting New Orleans for the first time -with ARREST. When he called the cops and instructed the police to arrest our trip organizer I couldn't tell if this was reality or a nightmare. 

Stay as far away from this restaurant as humanly possible, unless you want to risk ending up in jail for negotiating your bill."

Nice even heat, not too spicy at all, and they provided lots of condiments to make it hotter yourself. I love the location & atmosphere too. There were other mid-twenties folks hanging out on the heated porch & the Falcons were on.  As to those who complain about the wait: I am certain the reason I loved my meal so much is the chicken was fried as fresh as could be. No sitting around getting limp in its own heat and losing moisture through steam. I would wait 20 minutes any time. Oh and cheap and good local drafts are a BIG+. I'm not the BYOB type ;)",,

I've never had anything at ACME other than raw oysters and chargrilled oysters. I personally didn't like the Chargrilled. It's pretty cheesy, comes out piping hot, and the meat of the oyster went through some shrinkage after being grilled. These things will definitely hike up your hot qi.

The raws are where its at. Normally I don't even like oysters, but ACME's are great. Not slimy or seafoody. Goes down easy, even without the accompanying sauce. Some of them were HUGE too.

People will say Felix's across the street has the same oysters. But really, you came to NOLA for ACME. There's something in a name.",

I ordered a pasta with shrimp and alligator meat and it was DELICIOUS. They gave me three big slices of bread and I soon understood this was necessary for soaking up that incredible sauce. I also had an agave margarita which was lovely (nice presentation too with the ""smoking"" dry ice on top), and the bourbon pecan pie with vanilla ice cream....incredible.

Charbroiled Oysters (1/2 dozen) -- Acme's most popular item was just okay to me. The sauce on these was pretty good and I loved dipping the slices of French toast bread in it. The oysters however varied dramatically in size and taste. Would not get again.

Fried Crawfish Tails -- reminded me of calamari but not as tasty. Because it's so heavily breaded, you could barely distinguish the crawfish.

Crab & Corn Soup (of the day) -- Would get this again!

Seafood Étouffée (small) -- This was a well-liked dish among Yelpers but unfortunately, I was not a big fan. It wasn't bad, just a little bland to me. Wish it was more flavorful and came with more rice.

Hush Puppies -- These sweet and savory fried corn bread balls were probably my favorite thing, but I couldn't eat many before getting sick of the sugary taste.

Service was fine and fast. We didn't even wait that long for a table! We were quoted a 30-minute wait, but waited less than 15-minutes. Overall, everything was very mediocre and I probably wouldn't come back again. A little disappointing considering this was my first meal in New Orleans.",

Louisiana Crab meat cake- It's must. They give you 2 large pieces of crab cakes with crawfish and cream sauce smothered on top. It was delicious. I recommend sharing.

Fried Catfish Po'Boy- Huge sandwich. Fried catfish pieces on 2 large pieces of french bread with coleslaw and fries. It was ok to me. 

Cajun jambalaya pasta- This order never came out. I was quite disappointed because I really wanted to eat it. But I was already full off of the Po'boy and the crab meat cake. So we told them to cancel the order if they didn't start cooking it already.

Once you order, you have to go find a seat and luckily we had no problems with that part as a picnic table had just opened up. Be prepared to sit with other people. As soon as we sat down, we had three more people join us. As soon as our food was brought to the table, I knew it was going to be good. I'm seriously salivating just thinking about it. The chicken sandwich was better than any other spicy chicken sandwich I have had. It had a little kick to it, but I am glad we went with Hot. Greens are hit and miss for me because I am not a huge fan of vinegar and some people love to drown their greens in the stuff. I was surprised that being in TN, their greens were not vinegary at all! I really enjoyed the pimento mac and cheese. It was very creamy and cheesy and just had a little hint of the pimento flavor. The ranch dressing was good but different. I honestly think they put pickle juice in the stuff. It just worked! Everything was amazing and I want more!",,
3OJYo2-bkFiBwv1p4MWByA,"Best fried chicken I've ever had, period. The spiciness creeps up on you (left me sweating) but is flavorful, and the chicken is crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside!",,

3OZBqtpQlfv8vFlweOiTEw,"Went here Monday night around 9pm for some chicken after flying into Nashville. The service was super fast (5 minutes) and it seemed like there was a good mix of locals and tourists in the restaurant.

Food taste is why I'm giving it 3 stars. It was IMO overhyped by the Yelp comments? Like a I've had  better fried chicken in Seattle... I got chicken tenders (mild), Mac and cheese and fries. The sides were both bomb. The chicken was good, just not something to call home about.",,
3OdnLSBGdWYJmon9ucrayg,,,"Got oysters? 
No matter what else you order, definitely order the House Famous Oysters. Its a plate of Charbroiled Oysters smothered in garlic Cajun sauce. So delicious. We also ordered the Blackened Chicken Plate which is served with some Jambalaya and Greens. The chicken had just the right amount of Cajun spices and was pan broiled to perfection. Even the greens were tasty. We paired the food with the Nola Blonde Beer. For desert we got the Chocolate Kahlua Mousse and it was RICH. Great food, must visit."
3OhmhSCqstq-D_WLriRRqg,,,Lavern was our waitress and she was awesome. My party of 4 all loved our respective food. I highly recommend the Spinach ravioli.  Definitely going back before our trip is over.

I had the taste of New Orleans and it was the best food I had all weekend and well worth the modest prices. Service was prompt and friendly and the decor of the restaurant gave it a unique feel and character. 

Their food and drink menu were very diverse and affordable. 

Overall, I'm looking forward to coming back here."
3OiyeQvH2iZ28-wmK4TiZw,,"This would be put on my list of ""if you've tried it once then that's good enough."" 

Their raw oysters are a lot better than their charbroiled oysters, personally

I visited in the winter when it was windy and freezing so there wasn't really a line *high five*

I don't know if people go here after getting drunk on bourbon street (which is why it's so highly rated) but I've had better oysters than at this ""oyster house."" 

On the bright side, the environment is fun and the service is good!",

Hush puppies were one of my favorite, better than ones I had in the Carolinas. My wife had the beef PoBoy which had incredible flavor and taste!!Would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting NOLA!",

I was told that there's usually a long line and I'm not a patient person so I placed a to-go order on their website. We arrived at the time we had specified and we were able to jump to the front of the line that was out the door to grab our food and go! 

My dad likes spicy foods so we got the ""damn hot"" chicken and it wasn't that bad. So maybe we'll try the ""shut the cluck up"" next time lol. They give generous portions of sides and the chicken was very tender. I probably would've been hungry still if I only ordered a small plate, though. So if you're an eater, go for the large or 1/2 bird if you want! Would definitely go again if in the area!",,

After a 30-40 min wait, we were finally seated and ready to order. We started off with a dozen of their famous chargrilled oysters and craw puppies. We then ordered the seafood etoufee, fried oyster platter, and their 10 napkin roast beef po boy. The portions were generous, and the flavors were unforgettable. Their chargrilled oysters were so good, we ordered another dozen after devouring the other foods. Needless to say, if I'm ever in the area again (visited from NYC), I'd definitely revisit for some more chargrilled deliciousness.",

My boyfriend and I went for lunch, and it was a great choice if I do say so myself. 
We split an appetizer of fried Alligator Bites...SO GOOD! I hear alligator can be chewy, but these were cooked just right and the seasoning was awesome. So tasty. I didn't like the dipping sauce but I dont like horseradish so don't take my word for it if you do. 
He had the fried catfish platter and I ordered the seafood sampler with the addition of the crawfish tails. I loved it. The crawfish tails and shrimp were delicious and the catfish...man...I cannot get good friend catfish when I am home (Pittsburgh) so I usually order it a few times when in NOLA and damn, this was good. I mean melt in your mouth good. The platter also had fried oysters, which I didnt like at all. I had tried them elsewhere before and didn't like them but decided to give them another try...yeah, no. Fried oysters are apparently not my thing. The fries were tasty and there were jalapeno hushpuppies but I never got around to them, too much food on the plate! He ordered the Bananas Foster Ice Cream Cake and I had the Chocolate Kahlua Mousse cake. Amazing. Just yummy. It was a bit pricy...with one cosmopolitan and his iced tea we were at about $95.00 before tip but we found a gift cert on restaurant.com (I DONT WORK FOR THEM SO DONT FLAG MY REVIEW!!) which helped. All in all the price was pretty good for being at the intersection of Bourbon and Conti streets. 
Oceana Grill was fantastic...we will definitely be dining there again!"
3QLehcrPO7EX-p2y8o6OVQ,"Really enjoyed the chicken from Hattie B's. Both the sand which and the wings were well fried, but retained plenty of moisture inside. Incredibly long line in the store, but ordering online and eating elsewhere was quick. The sides were nothing to write home about, but let's be honest that's not what you came for. Tried the peach cobbler and was disappointed, very fake tasting.",,

Came here around 5ish and was seated in the back of restaurant with only 4 tables occupied. We were skeptic at first but saw yelp reviews before hand so we toughed it out. Our minds were blown away by how tasty the food was and it wasn't even fried. Food was so good that we came back for a second time. Only this time we came at 9pm and had to wait for 30 mins. we waited!",
3Qb7Z7dN-_0iZ3yiA_hCOg,,,"This place was such a nice surprise. At a glance, I thought it would be a typical Nola, kind of cheesy, seafood place where I couldn't eat anything (I'm a vegetarian). We saw online that there were a couple dishes that were vegetarian-friendly but not very exciting, like fettucine alfredo.

In actuality, the interior is pretty unique - lots of different levels to the restaurant, a really cool courtyard in the middle, balcony you can stand on, kind of hard to find your way around in but the staff was so friendly and very attentive to people wandering around looking lost. Good lighting and volume in the place - you could hear a background of people talking but also hear everyone at your table too. 

Servers were awesome, very casual and friendly, very happy to explain dishes and options. 

At first, I was disappointed because the menu in the restaurant did not have any of the vegetarian friendly options on it that are on the website. This is my major critique - the menu on site should have these items on it. Luckily, we asked the server and she confirmed that these options were still available, just ""off-menu."" I ordered the spinach ravioli expected it to be pretty basic and underwhelming. I was wrong!!! It was very well made and had super fresh spinach and kale cooked in, great seasoning, great cheese filling. I also ordered a cocktail which was super cool - they use dry ice in most of them which was fun, and it was seriously delicious, AND it was only like 8 bucks. Usually anything fancy with dry ice will run you $12+. I would go back just for drinks if I was able to.

It's also notable how well they handled our party of 14 people. It was impressive!"
3QiAOd0AfDlRytCtzkS-HQ,,"Amazing!  Can't wait to go back. 

Long wait but so worth it.  Everything was delicious and the service was great as well. Definitely try the boo fries and the hush puppies  and make sure you over order. It will be so worth it!",
3Qnh7-gzwZqcEfAbpIlawA,,,"Came here on the last day of the trip after hearing rave reviews from some locals, and I'll be honest... this place was bang average.

I get the appeal of it, it's a large space, has fruity drink offers and is in the middle of the French Quarter, but I can't help but feel we got a little short changed eating here.

Again, a lot of classics on the menu with Gumbo, Jambalaya, Po Boys etc but everything just seemed like a watered down version for tourists, and even then the food was a bit lackluster 

We had some gator bites to start, which were probably the only good thing about the meal - well seasoned and good texture, served with a little Cajun aioli.

The gumbo 

Mains, as I say left a lot to be desired. I had the Fried Oyster Po Boy. The oysters were soggy and were served on some shitty saw dust like roll, with a little coleslaw and lettuce - and apparently that's a Po Boy. It was also served with fries... but like... so underwhelming and with no love or flavour. Something I'd expect from 7 eleven for $5.

A place more suited for Batchelorette/Batchelor parties, given the array of drinks deals - but the food was a bit meh"
3Qwx1-E2WX9GtDEOKe8F5Q,,"I definitely wouldn't wait more than 5 minutes for this place. We decided to go today since it was raining and sure enough there wasn't really a line. We waited around 20 minutes and where we sat was at the bar right by the door. It was freezing on this could day so that kind of sucked, but we powered through, because this place was hyped up. The staff though was amazing, super helpful, and extremely nice. The service was excellent and a well oiled machine. 

The boo fries were amazing and I would highly recommend them to any hungover or just plain hungry person.  We got a half dozen raw oysters and half dozen charbroiled ones. The raw ones were good, but I was meh on them. My husband didn't like the charbroiled ones and said they were too rubbery for his liking. Even our Lyft driver said Felix's across the street was just the same if not better. I honestly would not wait here again to eat here, and you can find great oysters all around town.",
3R0CBP0uKhcbvIlBDIMBmQ,,,"Came in for lunch, and had to come back for dinner. The gumbo was good, but the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta was amazing!

We got the Pork and Gator, so good. The veggies with the pork where very tart, the meat however, to die for. The gator was great. Also, had the beat salad (Mmmm) and Gumbo (chicken and sausage) so good. 

Go you will truly enjoy it."

Their levels of spiciness are really hot. They are almost too hot to even enjoy the food.  So I went with mild. Their sides are not that great. I got Mac and cheese and greens. The greens were a little too salty. The mac and cheese was pretty good and  different since the put pimento pieces to add flavor. The chicken was really good! Crispy and moist. It's definitely become a tourist attraction and seems to be too hyped up. The chicken is worth the wait and you should try it! The only down side is there is not much indoor/ AC seating so your bound to sit outside in the heat in the summer l, even at night!",,

The line is easily out the door even at 4pm. I remember getting half a chicken to be ""mother clucking"" hot and well, i quickly regretted my decision because it was way too spicy for me and not enjoyable for me. My fiance was able to handle the heat, but let's just say that it's ""passing"" was memorable.

If I ever go back, I'd go with something less spicy. I'm sure it's because I ordered the wrong thing, but just with my initial try, this chicken seems a bit overrated.",,

We had to wait in line outside the building, but the line moved very quickly. This restaurant is a lot bigger than it may appear form the outside with multiple floors of dining. 

We started off with a dozen fresh shucked oysters. They were divine and so big! Next we split the Gator Tail Bites. Also amazing. We especially loved the dipping sauce they came with. We also split a cup of the seafood gumbo. Yet again we were blown away by how delicious it was. For dinner we split the Redfish Oceana. My boyfriend has a dairy allergy so we asked for the crawfish mushroom cream sauce to be put on the side and they were very accommodating. This dish was also delicious. We were so stuffed but couldn't pass up on the desserts so we split the bread pudding. YUM! This might have been one of the best bread puddings I have ever had. 

Overall our experience here was amazing. If and when I am ever back in New Orleans I will definitely be making a stop here. The food was great, the service was quick and friendly, and for a restaurant right in the French Quarter with food of this quality the price was very reasonable."
3Str0P10f6n6345N04LOig,"Every holiday break, we make a pit stop in Nashville on the way to visit family. We usually arrive after 9pm, which leaves Hattie B's Chicken as one of the only hot chicken places that is open late enough for us to visit. This year, the Midtown location was within walking distance from our AirBnB, which gave it bonus points. Because we get there after 9pm, we've never experienced a wait--more bonus points!

I usually order to hot sandwich, but this year, I opted to try the small dark because that's hot chicken was originally made. I have to say I prefer the boneless hot chicken that comes on the sandwich. There's nothing like it, and next year, I'll stick to my usual order. The bone-in chicken just tasted like regular chicken after the greasy breading crumbled off. It was still good, but I was disappointed by it. The sides are always delicious. Pro tip--order the mac n cheese and coleslaw to cool your burning mouth. 

When in Nashville, Hattie B's is the place to check out that famous hot chicken!",,
3T2fIIu3lWWlBameI8_hUg,,"This is a go to if its is your first time in the Big Easy!! 

If you have never had oysters, this is the time and place to try them. Yes, ""Oyster House"" is in the name so you would expect for this to be the place and that is correct. Acme is a staple in the French Quarter and the line outside proves that. Every time I visit the city I come to Acme as its a high tourist spot that can never get old. As crowded as they stay and the notoriety they have the service is still nothing less then the NOLA spirit! 

The chargrilled oysters are amazing. When in NOLA you will find them on every menu and eatery so there are plenty of options that rank at the top but you will not be disappointed here. Go ahead, you're on vacation get some for the table and try something new. 

My go to option is the half po-boy option which comes with a side. Theres not really a way to mess up a po-boy since the notion of one is the limited ingredients. Your po-boy will come stuffed with your meat of choice and is delish! My most recent visit I tried the red beans and rice and yumm it was good. 

Be prepared to wait in line no matter when you go but it is worth the wait! Definitely a must go if you have never been.",

The food and drinks would just as good at the bar as I'm guessing it would be at the tables. We always love talking to the bar tenders and hearing there stories.

As a ride-sharing driver, I often recommend Hattie B's.",,

Chicken tenders with Mac and Cheese and Cole slaw. It was delicious! Would definitely go back again.

Not to mention all of our friends on yelp that have ranted and raved about Acme.  We ordered 1/2 dozen of the Charbroiled Oysters (MUST HAVE), the lady ordered the fried Crawfish, and I had the New Orleans Sample plate (this plate was served with one small piece of sausage, one cup of gumbo, and a small serving of red beans and rice.  While I wasn't impressed with the portion size for the money, my girlfriends portion was more than enough as she chose it from the ""appetizer"" selection.  I left a bit unsatisfied and I am not a huge guy or a heavy eater.  That being said, the food was very good, authentic, and delicious.  Even though the food was good, our server, Keisha was not!  She was slow, inattentive, and offered nothing to the overall experience of visiting Acme.  She lacked personality and had no recommendations.  I expected more.  When my gf asked if she could get ranch the server's response, ""we don't have ranch"".  Not, ""we don't offer ranch, but you'd like (insert alternative here)"".  I don't think she smiled one time during our meal/visit.  I would come back and sit at the bar and order the charbroiled oysters again.  Don't plan on sitting down at a table in the future.",
3U-xhABT591TiYUcDda5vw,,"I am a tourist so of course I had to stay in line for an hour and try the Acme oysters.
 
The line was actually not bad and only took us ~30mins to get in. Waitress was as promised, only available sometimes, so we took out time with the menu. 

These are what we had:

1. dozen oysters on half shell ($13.99)  - I don't eat raw oysters, but bf said it's the best out of the oyster bars we tried (Felix, Desire, Acme) in term of freshness. He said they are all fresh but the oysters in Acme are so fresh you feel like they grew up in a loving family that's filled with laughter and kindness, whereas the oysters from other placed tasted like they had a conservative, middle-class upbringing. Go figure whatever that means. However, these oysters are tiny, like oyster-fetus kinda tiny. The oysters we got at Desire is about twice or three times the size of the ones served in Acme. 

2.  1/2 dozen chargrilled oysters ($12) - best chargrilled oysters, definitely get it when you're here. The last time I had an oyster was before I could talk and I've lived on a seafood-extinction diet for as long as I can remember, but the chargrilled oysters here is so tempting I ended up trying one before my conscious stopped me, and boy, was it delicious! And no, shrimp doesn't count as seafood.

3. Fried Shrimp platter ($14) - skip this. This is the worst dish I've had during my trip in NOLA, and that includes a ham and turkey sandwich from CVS when I was in a rush. There were 10 tiny fried shrimps scattered pathetically on some fries and a lot of bread. Not exactly sure what the bread's for, maybe for propping the fries up so it looks as if there're a lot of them. The cole slaw was mediocre too.",
3U1rQqlAdDna-lVTY0bVtA,"Ran over here on a lunch break and the yelp reviews were true! If you're running low on patience eat somewhere else. Came in at 11:30 am on a Tues and waited a little over 30mins for food. Line was out the door, two ladies were getting a takeout order fixed the entire time I waited. Line had mostly businessmen eager to chat with out of towners. Indoor seating area is tiny but if you wait as long as I did you will be able to score a table. The outdoor seating area triples the space but even with patio heaters and a plastic cover I wasn't going to brave it on this unusually cold  January day in Nashville. 

Now for the food I was prepared to get hot chicken. I mean I love spicy foods! After talking to three different people about spice levels I settled on the Medium. It was spicy but I totally could have handled hot! I say just go for it. My pimiento Mac and cheese had just the right amount of spice!

3WEiczq1ggzJyFwT-X5AgQ,,,"10pm was rapidly approaching and our options were dwindling by the minute. We didn't want to walk into a place that was about to close, for several reasons: angry staff, being rushed, old food - the usual. 

This place was in my tags, had a check-in offer and stays open late. Ratings seemed good enough... decision made. Seeing the line to get in sealed the deal. Everyone knows that if there's a line, it's worth waiting for!

When our turn came, the host walked/slid us to the table (potentially a thick coat of grease on the floor) and pointed out the restrooms as we passed. It's on the corner of Bourbon St, so, restrooms are a hot commodity - great start.

Drink order was taken right away, also ordered a crab cake app. They split the app into 2 plates for the 2 of us, fabulous, but this is where it gets complicated. Someone else's plate was placed on our table & the server walked away. She then came back, picked it up & served it - served food from our table that hadn't even remained in sight. 

About this time we were presented with the worst bloody mary of the trip, possibly the worst I've ever had. But 1 bite of crab cake and all was forgiven. They were excellent, possibly the best I've ever had. Drinks + Apps = a wash.

Entrees were good - my husband's (blackened) better than mine (redfish). If I had to guess, I'd guess the greens were canned. I find mashed potatoes an odd fish accompaniment, texturally. 

The crab cakes were the standout & blackened fish the runner up. The bloody mary, a disaster.

They needed a reminder to adjust the bill for the check-in offer, but gladly did so. Service was good, especially for being so busy. We were checked on regularly and offered refills. Water was presented without asking. Before departing, we were reminded about the restrooms.

Would I go back? Definitely, if only for crab cakes. Unfortunately, I can't rate higher given the bad drink & the major fail of re-serving food."

Excellent Po Boy named ""The Peace Maker"" half oyster, half shrimp, & of course, the kick ass bread they use for Po Boys in this city. Yumscilly! We ate 3 dozen raw, a dozen char grilled (soooo wrong & tasty!) & split the Peace Maker, between just the two of us. Definitely a spot to visit while you're here",

3WVLDJ6u578iC5E6rO4eZw,,Place seems weak and overrated. Line of people out the door for some reason. Jambalaya was mediocre and way too salty. Everyone else's food e.g. ettoufee and po boys looked sad as well. Service was pretty good but moderately butthurt as well. Heading to the airport soon and displeased that I spent my last lunch here.,
3W_wyIdmbMhljkLHRFOu1g,,My first po boy. Fried shrimp. A fantastic aioli spread loaded with fried shrimp. Not greasy at all. And pickles. I am a convert. My husband had the fried oysters with hush puppies. Not greasy. Not heavy on the breading. Just perfect. He was so happy with his fried oysters.,

We were in town for A Taekwondo tournament and decided to celebrate our wins here. The place is mad popular and when you get there chicken you can tell why. Very delicious, very moist, and a taste that can't be beat. The only downfall of this place is that they are not bigger to accommodate all the people that want their chicken.",,

We started off with a dozen Chargrilled oysters and a dozen of the raw oysters. Those chargrilled oysters are a must-get and they are absolutely out-of-this-world delicious. The oysters are perfectly cooked, juicy, buttery, all that good stuff.

Another huge hit was the soft shell crab plate. So good that we finished the whole plate and then ordered another. Acme definitely perfected their seafood game and i SO am down for it.

Also WOW hush puppies are soo good?!? Give me all of them!!

Etoufee is also delicious but nothing beats those oysters and that crab. I will be back for you Acme!!",
3YNDFLQ7sD3wP6M6cesoVQ,,,Not sure why this is in the French Quarter. The fried seafood may as well be out of a frozen tv dinner box. Ultra commercial.

Though the line is always long by the time you order and find there is an available seat for you. Parking isn't too fun but that's due to location being a really happening area and the fact that the food is great. 

We recently went back and tried their new chicken sandwich OMG mouth watering full of taste, heat, layers of flavor a with the slaw and pickle. I can eat it every other day but my cholesterol may not be able to handle it!",,

the raw oysters were delicious as well.  i wasn't a big fan of the $9 bloody marys though because they only had 1 shot in em but they tasted decent.  great location as well and didn't have to wait at all for seats for dinner!  it was pretty hectic but Ralph took care of us and he was very sweet--kinda reminds me of Bruno Mars :)"
3ZpbgBek2lGQErMkS4stBA,"The chicken is flavorful and the mild has a nice spice to it.

Had a great server who recommended a couple of dishes which were outstanding. Some of the best service that we've had in New Orleans, and that's saying something. The red beans and rice is delicious as are the fried oyster and shrimp Po boys. I'm not sure that there's anything here that wouldn't be just absolutely delicious.",
3ZzqLze0Dmqu-nuqnGraXw,,,"On my first attempt at eating here there was a ""20 minute"" wait and they took my name, phone number, and party number. I was told they'd contact me on my turn. My group went walking in the area and never got a call. We ended up eating somewhere else.

On my second attempt we were again told a ""20 minute wait"" and we waited closer to 45 minutes. I learned that they dont contact you when your table is ready. It actually is a covid list with your name and number they have you sign while you're waiting outside in line before even actually getting seated. 

The wait was worth it in the end however. I have to say the food was really good. The waitress was friendly and helpful. I ordered from a picture I saw on yelp from 2 years ago, asking the waitress what it was. It turns out it was the Oceana Redfish Lafourche, which I was told was actually removed from the menu. It was still able to be ordered however. I was told it was redfish with fried crawfish, crawfish etouffee, and jambalaya rice underneath. It was amazing, I must say. My friend ordered the seafood gumbo and it was also very good. Another friend ordered the fried shrimp platter. It had so much food but for the price, the sharing was worth it. The waitress mixed up my drink order. I originally ordered the Tropical Storm and was given the Bahama Mama instead but I actually liked it better once I tasted the Tropical Storm on my second visit.

On my third visit, I was again told ""15-20 minute wait"" and ended up waiting about 30 so just expect if there's a bit of line outside to not actually wait 20 minutes.  I would definitely recommend this place for the tasty food."

We had 4 people and shared 2 orders of 1/2 chicken, 6 sides and a banana pudding to share.  Having had Korean fried chicken I would say the medium is spicy enough for most folk who regularly enjoy tobasco sauce slathered on their food.  Anymore and you probably won't taste chicken. Just heat.  Wait staff friendly.  Banana pudding was by far best part of meal.  Pimiento macaroni and cheese soupy and not salted. Yuck.  Collards were ok. I was good w the less salt there but not much flavor. Decent w some vinegar pepper sauce though except 1/2 the container was pot liquor that, without flavor, was not tasty.  Pickles were good.  Black eyed pea salad was second best thing. Very nice. Fries were fries.  Coleslaw not too heavy and slightly sweet so good w the spicy chicken.  Now for the chicken: crispy- check, juicy- check, flavorful- ok but not stellar.  But leaps and bounds over Party Fowl. Overall-- Korean chicken here we come...",,

3_UzdLx7oQ4759Ho-5bGPQ,,"Everyone told me to check this place out. It was a bad start but ended well. It started out bad as there was a long line to get in! To make it worse we had to wait out by the trash and it was drizzling! Almost lost my appetite!  We didn't wait too long - maybe 15-20 minutes.  Except, I was upset because the couple in back of us went before us and we were also a couple.  They have optional bar seating if you want any available seat but they ended up seating us right next to them!! They have to better organize their seating waiting list. 

Well, I soon got my appetite back! I ordered the fish and shrimp platter. I've never had oysters so I figured I'd try it - I orders half a dozen of the char-grilled. Very good - I think it was cooked in garlic and butter. The shrimp and fish were average but since this is my first time trying oysters; I can't really compare. I also had a side of red beans and rice - yummy.  I could live on rice and beans! Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was casual.  They had some small tables and long dining hall tables you share with other groups. It wasn't too bad but we were on the end.",

The menu was hardly unique, and I think there are many other restaurants that have a better ambiance to try the New Orlean's dishes.",

3_wlevu6PjcKv6LWg3E5IQ,"Let me tell you a story of chicken sorrow. Today three friends set out for a one-hour tour to visit Hattie B's for lunch. One friend, being me, had not yet tried this establishment and was quite excited. We ordered online over a half-hour before opening time, knowing full well how hot chicken places in Nashville can be a bit slow, due to the nature of the product. My order was simple and was placed at roughly the same time as my two friends' orders. 

We arrived just after opening time. The procedure for picking up an internet order is unintuitive, without any explanation as to whether you wait in line or go straight to the counter. Apparently, from experience, my friends knew you go straight to the counter. So...I stroll up to the counter expecting my order to be ready. Nope. Not started yet. So I guess no point in ordering online in advance, eh? 

A little while passes, and both my friends' orders arrive. They similar orders (actually larger) placed AFTER mine. I'm still waiting. We ask probably four different employees (who were all excellently friendly) and each time they seemed to think the order was underway but not yet done. 

At about the sixth inquiry, a half hour after arrival, and while me and a friend were both talking to different staff members trying to figure it out, the owner strolls up and asks us, in effect, to clear the counter. It appeared he was working on a large order and wanted the space, but I have no way of knowing. Anyway, he didn't ask why we were standing there, nor did he inquire as to what was going on...just asked us to move and wait for our name to be called. Obviously, if my name had been called, I wouldn't be standing there, Mr. B. Very rude to do so without dealing with the customer service issue that was ongoing, and his tone was, in my personal opinion, condescending. 

A few more minute passed and they finally found my ticket. It hadn't been started yet. I suspect part of why they couldn't find it when they kept looking for the paper ticket (in was in the computer) was my somewhat consonant-riddled ethnic last name, but I'm not sure, either way...I got my food finally after a few more minutes. The staff was apologetic but the owner ignored me. 

I was so angry I left. I'm not ashamed to admit I told the owner he was rude and lost a customer on my way out. He seemed baffled as to why I was angry. My advice to him...ask before you move customers, they may be having a problem. 

The food was just okay. Not my favorite hot chicken but perfectly adequate. Then again, I ate it after driving back to the office because I was so annoyed, so maybe it would have been better in on site. Good fries. I had plain and medium chicken. Medium was hot but not that hot, and not really enough seasoning for the heat. The plain was better but still, the grease had a taste to it I didn't like. Food was 3-4/5 in my opinion. Service far worse. Ruined my afternoon. Will not return.",,
3a4kzVIPNVkKrxEgwc1FkQ,,,"We tried multiple times to place a delivery order over the phone with Joseph and when he wasn't putting us on hold for extended periods of time and then hanging up, he was taking down our information only to hang up while we were speaking to him.

3aCz89BHkCVv6hfQHEaLLw,"They definitely live up their hype! Chicken was crispy & juicy & flavorful. One of the best hot chicken places I've ever been to in my life! 
It was affordable and the service was excellent. They also serve local beer which was great.",,

Entrees came out fast as well.  Food was good and as expected, but what really stood out was our waitress, Dorothy.  She accommodated all of our requests regarding billing and some special needs that we had in this area.  She was down to earth, professional, and a good person.  She made our dinner stand out from what would have been an otherwise normal/good experience."

3alb3_1x5wIWcUTzFujQDQ,Delicious!!!  I've tried them all and I like this one the best!  The only downside is the long line and sometimes delivery is cold.  Go for a milder grade than you're used to!,,
3apBDykEn8kcq1wKZYaGVg,"I have many reviews on here...check them. I'm usually pretty nice when I leave reviews. I don't leave too many low reviews at all, but this place is pretty overrated. I could be wrong, but I'd be surprised if most of their business comes from tourists and not returning locals. I asked every Uber/Lyft driver we had and they all said the same thing. Overrated. But...I had to try it out and see for myself. 

Luckily, we caught it at a good time, because honestly I'd be livid if I waited in line for this stuff. The chicken wasn't really anything to speak of. Popeyes spicy chicken is a better option in my opinion. 

We got several spice levels of chicken. Now, as someone from the South who enjoys spicy foods and has a pretty high tolerance for spice, I was a bit surprised by the scale of spiciness. ""Hot"" should be hot but not knock your socks off hot. ""Damn hot"" should be a little on the make me sweat side. But if you think you can handle ""damn hot"" just know that spice level doesn't exactly convey how spicy that actually is. I don't see how anyone can eat that and actually enjoy their meal. It's more like a ""Man Vs Food"" spice level. The fact that there is another level above that is insane. 

I only tried a bit of the damn hot simply because all you can taste is the spice. I guess that's to cover the fact that the chicken meat is bland. The zero spice level chicken wasn't very good at all on the inside and the skin wasn't great at all.

Now...my real issue with this place. Myself and 5 other people...some of whom did NOT have the ""damn hot"" and some who did...ALL spent the next day and a half on the toilet. Tore our stomachs apart. My girlfriend got the ZERO spice version and she was sick all day. 

Look...don't jump on this place because it's touristy. Ask around, other places serve better food. I'm not getting into that, but just do your research and try going  somewhere that doesn't survive by being a tourist trap. More like Hattie F minus.",,
3bI-fdT9_1zfhgga6_5oIQ,OMG!!!! This place will not disappoint you.  By far the best chicken I've ever eaten.  Trust me when i tell you this.  This is a must try if your ever in the area.  We had the chicken sandwich with potato salad and the wings with greens and baked beans.  I wish I could bottle this and bring it home.,,

3cEtd-vihhr97aTxzZbA0w,What I did not like about Hattie B's Chicken was that the heat/flavor profile seemed to be made up exclusively of cayenne pepper.,,
3cUwX2T73HZxHR7eY0qNRw,,,BBQ shrimp was good but missing a few ingredients to make it great. Oceana Oyster special was excellent.  Great flavor and generous portions. Taste of New Orleans had the most richly decadent red beans and rice. Jambalaya was a bit tomato based and dry. Shrimp etouffee was solid. Bananas foster ice cream cake was a great selection. Great service especially because we arrived just before closing.
3ckX2hhMUlLpfbCrYcIqrQ,,"After 45 min waiting outside - in a very cold evening - we get in. Tables are very small and all decoration is very simple. 
However - as soon as we get the grilled oyster - we stop looks on anything else. This restaurant famous for this dish and it's real as good as it get. We order another one - just because it's so good. 
Service was simple ( i.e.: friendly and not sophisticated ) and great. 
Great meal",
3d4fac-e3Plyib8QUEmHNg,"We got off the plane, took a cab, and with our luggage stood in a long line(maybe 30 mins?) to eat here LOL It was absolutely worth it. We shared a plate(this was the first spot on our food tour that day): Hot Chicken plate with Collards, Coleslaw and the Mac n Cheese. I know, right? Lets talk about the Hot Chicken - the flavor was on point. We got the hot heat level, it was perfect. Even with the sauce the chicken was crispy and very moist. The mac n cheese was awesome, but my favorite side was the collard. It was very tender. We had a great first impression of Nashville - we looked out at the line and saw other people with their luggages too. Don't be ashamed to come here with your luggage - it's perfectly normal. Don't skip this place.",,
3dODPLg1-rPtv7EnftXH6g,Amazing chicken. We tried hot chicken at another restaurant down the road that was more expensive and decided to try this place base don the reviews.

3dYzH6Xv58j0PbyCRg120g,"So I've been to Hattie Bs at least 10 times in the 2 years I've lived in Nashville and it's definitely worthy of the 5 star reputation. I personally order the large white combo basket and I do like it spicier so I order hot and it's got plenty of heat! I usually order the greens and pimento mac n cheese as my sides and both are fantastic! Be sure to get a side or two of ranch for your chicken cuz it truly is spicy! 
Side note, my friend once ordered a shut the cluck up tender and I tried a nibble and it was terribly hot. Like not even enjoyable hot. He said his stomach was hurting the rest of the day. So moral of the story is beware of the heat!! But this place really is awesome and a staple of Nashville.",,

After a 5 minute wait, the courteous staff seated us. It's got great atmosphere! We ordered the catfish and Cajun fries as well as cocktails. The catfish was fresh and light and served 2. The staff is attentive and the portions generous."
3dpA-o-o1Y2YVcf-G24TOg,"I've been to Hattie B's twice now and they've won me over. Nashville hot chicken is a MUST if you're a visitor - and this is where you should get it. 

I went for brunch yesterday and got there ~30 minutes before it opened at 11. We were probably 15 people back in the line that had already formed. By the time 11 came around the line was down the block. I went with the tenders and waffles (medium heat) with the Sunday special side (bacon cheese grits). The medium heat is a good balance between heat and flavor, which says something because usually I usually can't handle heat well. Every bite of chicken is juicy and flavorful, and every bite of waffle is like biting into a cloud. The grits were a good pairing for brunch. 

Be aware that you WILL have to wait in line at any peak time. If you don't expect that going in you will be annoyed. But keep in mind that the reward for waiting is beyond worth it. The service is great and I'll certainly be back every time I come back to Nashville.",,

3fNoUWEb5ugn9I3KgS1weA,,,I do not recommend this place at all if you are gluten free.  My husband said his food was fine (he can eat gluten).  They do have a gluten free menu with about five items on it.  I ordered the steak and veg from that menu.  They brought me out what was clearly from a steam fresh type of bag frozen veg and an unseasoned steak (not even salt or pepper was on this thing).  They seemed surprised that I was unsatisfied with it and offered to fix it by taking it back to put salt and pepper on it.  I just sent it back and stopped somewhere else on the way home.  They didn't even comp my one drink or anything in way of apology but they very graciously removed the charge for the meal I didn't eat.  It's tough to eat gluten free (I get very sick from it) in New Orleans but there are better places out there that accommodate with food that has flavor in the same price range as this place.

I have been going here for years for the fresh seafood as well as the Cajun food! These folks can cook! Good food Fun atmosphere and friendly staff will make me brave the line to get in. Definitely a must when in N.O.

3gRyk73iBu-T2XRBngRb4Q,"Holy hot chicken! This place is amazing! We arrived at the perfect time right before the dinner rush hit, so we were in line for less than 10 minutes, and it took another 10 minutes or so to get our food. Parking is a challenge here so be prepared to walk. We happened to get lucky and catch one of a handful of spots in the parking lot. Having never been here before we each got a plate with different sides so that we could try a variety. 2 sm white plates including collards, potato salad, coleslaw, and mac n cheese and 2 sweet teas came to about $24 and was just the right about if food. The chicken and collards were the stars of the show. Potato salad and mac were decent, and the coleslaw had a bit too much mayo for me,but I know that's personal preference. Word of caution, don't get too overzealous when choosing how hot you order your chicken!",Chargrilled oysters are amazing! Ambiance is great for a hole in the wall. Got to sit at the bar for an early dinner. Staff was friendly and attentive. Be sure to get here early to miss the line.,

Fantastic environment and the workers were very nice and accommodating.,,

This place is worth the wait but we never did, we just sat at the oyster bar which to us made a great experience. We visited this place twice while on our extended weekend trip which says a lot, right. 

We on both occasions ordered the charred oysters which were so delicious. The forest oysters, cheese, bread, butter, and hot sauce all just paired so fabulous.

Their etouffe with fried crawfish tails was absolutely delicious. The fried crawfish was so yummy and perfectly seasoned and crispy.

The chicken gumbo was also so delicious and full of flavor.

On our last visit we did the sample platter which had gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans and rice with a side of sausage a great deal and all very delicious.",

You can see a difference in color between mild/medium and Damn Hot, and they are wildly different in flavor.",,

3irUJORP8qO5epRgDv69Sw,,"ACME Oyster House is everything you would expect from a touristy place in the middle of the biggest party area in a super-party city! The place is bustling, there are lots of people, and the service is fast. The food is good, but very formulaic. ACME's classic recipes likely have not changed in many years. They have also not evolved either... 

Long story short: Typical tourist hyped up place. Did not wow. I would skip this place for a restaurant with more updated atmosphere and bolder flavors. 

We ordered the chargrilled oysters as appetizer, and while they 'looked' comparable to Deanies, they were nowhere near the fresh Parmesan and garlic flavor, that Deanie's oysters won our absolute kudos with. We also ordered the sides of Jambalaya and hush puppies, as well as half and half PoBoys (half shrimp and half oysters), and those were great, but I still feel that the other seafood place we visited edged ACME out with fresher, more crispy and plentiful ingredients. 
The bread pudding that our server Robin highly recommended was really great and hearty. 


ACME is a classic institution, and if you are into the classic places - definitely go.  For my money however, I would give other, less-tourist-hyped places a try.",
3j50d_OtZ5gCTW4uZIFw9Q,"My first visit here on a rainy day meant the line wasn't too long thankfully.  My small white meat meal was very very good, medium spice did the trick.  Fries and black bean salad were good enough.  I don't think it would be much fun to wait here for a table on a busy day. Parking stinks.",,
3jjiY5D7oIlKeiCIZGHQew,"How has Hot Chicken not spread like wildfire across the US? This stuff is seriously soooooo good. I don't know about you guys, but I love spicy stuff. I also love fried chicken. Put those two together and you've got a lethal combination! 

Once we heard that hot chicken was a Nashville thing, we had to try it while we were in town. So we get there and start looking up the menu, we all each get a platter. I got the leg and thigh combo - Damn Hot. Since there were four of us, we figured we would order a platter of wings to share in addition to the platter we ordered for ourselves. The cashier said, ""You know these are whole wings right?"" Yeah, sure, whatever. When our food finally comes out, we each get our platters then 3 extra platters with 4 WHOLE wings each end up in the middle of our table. I said, ""DAMN, that is a lotta chicken!"" So we gave one to our neighbor. So FYI, don't be stupid like us and think that these are little buffalo wings that you get at a sports bar. 

No joke though, it's probably a good thing that hot chicken isn't everywhere. The stuff is addicting and our obesity epidemic would probably be even more out of hand. Just sayin'.",,

3kDUxh5d3DWcnqEoFXglxw,Chicken was great but not worth the long wait.  I'd do take out if I were local.  Mac and cheese was a little runny but great taste.  Everyone said to be conservative on the heat so I went mild but medium would have been perfect.  Would love one in jax.,,

Went here as recommended by a tour guide and tourist visiting center so maybe we were a little apprehensive as visiting center also gave us a card for discount. We enjoyed our meal here.  Waiter recommended gator bites blacked and fried as we had only first tried gator a day prior in a sausage.  The dipping sauce was good and found the fried gator a little less chewy but again,  we had not had gator before.  The blackened had a good flavor tho. We both ordered the redfish oceana and enjoyed it.  We ordered the crawfish mushroom cream sauce on the side just in case and glad we did.  This gave us a bit more control with the flavors, the red potatoes mashed were also good.  All and all a decent meal.  Waiter very attentive and gave us the name of a restaurant locals go to for Cajun food."

3kxxMBFaqD7zFTDZc2y49g,,,"I dedicated my energies on my NOLA trip to eating all of the Cajun food and Oceana was the best of all of the restaurants I tried.  I am not a local, nor a connoisseur of Cajun food, but everything that we tried here was excellent.  We started with the Gator Bites, which were served with a spicy remoulade.  The meat was a little chewy, but the sauce was to die for.  Who cares about the meat with sauce like that?  For our main dishes, we had the crawfish etouffé and oyster po boys.  The etouffé was perfectly seasoned, and for such a heavy dish, felt suprisingly light.  The po boys were the best we tried on our trip.  The combination of the fried oysters, crispy bread, and remoulade was delicious.  The service was also excellent and I liked the casual ambience.

Oceana was a little pricier than some of the other places I ate in the Quarter, but I honestly think it was well worth the extra money for the quality."
3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg,"This was the best meal we had in Nashville!  Our eyes were much, much larger than our stomachs on this day, but I don't regret a single bite!

We both ordered ""large"" portions (warning:  do not do this unless you are going to share).  Why did we do this?  Because we are used to shrinky dink chicken pieces from KFC or the grocery store.

I had the mild, and he had the medium.  We were both satisfied with our choices.  I'm not a daredevil when it comes to spice, but I still like it.  So the mild was perfect - it left a little tingle and burn on my lips but I didn't need a fire to be put out either.  Not only was this the best hot chicken, it was the best fried chicken we've ever had.

The mac & cheese was the best side, I'm sad just thinking about it because I'll probably never visit Nashville again or be able to replicate this recipe.

I don't know what's up with the white bread they serve with the chicken.  I told my husband it was just to soak up the grease, but I'm not sure if that's totally true or if it is meant to be eaten.

The cherry on top is the selection of local beers.  I selected my regional favorite, Abita Strawberry, since I can't get it at home.  It complimented my meal really well.","I had my doubts about Acme, since it's right in the middle of tourist-town, but it was featured on Man vs. Food, and a friend highly recommended it to me.  She didn't steer me wrong with other restaurants, so Acme was our final meal in New Orleans.

First, the food is outstanding!  The charbroiled oysters are a must.  My only other oyster experience in New Orleans was at another restaurant, where they were fried and too salty.  The charbroiled oysters at Acme were a thousand times better, and we really should've ordered a dozen instead of a half.  The po-boys are also very good.

Second, the service is not good.  Yes, you will have to wait in line, and there was a line down the block before they even opened.  We were prepared for this, so I was pleasantly surprised that when they did open, we didn't have to wait - we were one of the first diners seated, party of 2.  Our waitress took our order and got our drinks fairly quickly.  Then it went downhill.  I noticed that 3 other groups, no bigger than party of 3, all were seated after us, ordered after us, but got their food, paid their check and even left - all before we got our food.  The waitress apologized and asked if we wanted a bowl of gumbo while we waited, and she blamed the kitchen for being behind.  I'm almost positive she just forgot to put in our order.  Why would I want a bowl of soup?  She did not comp anything on our check either, just kept asking us if we wanted something else.

I also thought it was strange that there was a small group of military standing in line, and they made them wait until they seated other parties of 2.  They do seat smaller parties first; however, when we sat inside the restaurant I noticed 2 tables open with more than enough seats for this group.  What a way to treat your military!

The only way I'd go back here, after the awful service, is to sit at the bar and have oysters.  I really wouldn't want to interact with any of the servers again.",
3ljKbCUGIiaTlC3B__T-iA,,,"This was the first place we are when we arrived in New Orleans. The drinks earned most of the stars on this review. I enjoyed the Sazerac I ordered. The waitress was friendly, but, we waited a while before we finally got to order. 

My husband and I ordered the oysters Rockefeller for appetizers. I only ate 1. I wasn't impressed. 

For dinner we each ordered a cup of seafood gumbo and we shared the tour of NOLA platter. The gumbo was too fishy, even for seafood gumbo (Visit Tujagues for GREAT seafood gumbo!.) I didn't finish my cup. The crawfish étouffée was awful. I LOVE étouffée and prepare it once a year at home during crawfish season. Theirs tasted like dirt and neither of us touched it again after the first bite. The sausage was good, the red beans and rice were ok and the jambalaya was good.

We ordered a bread pudding for dessert and it wasn't bad, but it was underwhelming.

Overall, I give it an ""eh."" I won't go back. There are just too many AMAZING places to eat in NOLA to wait in line for this ""ok"" one..."

3mPnV1Zl9P37z31_gFEt-g,,"I had the BEST TIME EVER!!!  I tried the chargrilled oysters and had the best conversation with Michael Hollywood Broadway!

3mZrXEDBw4tZviWX0SDCoQ,,,"After a long day of travel and our kids staying at my mom's house for the night, we wanted a place that was open late near our hotel. After searching, we decided Oceana was the best spot. Probably not the place I would have picked if it were a decent hour. But at 10:30 on a Sunday night, we were pretty limited. The service was great and so were the raw oysters. But that is pretty much where the good ended.

We decided to test out the BBQ Shrimp as an app in addition to the oysters. The sauce was not anything like I have had with other BBQ shrimp. It was too thick and sort of bland. For that reason, it did not flavor the shrimp at all. The shrimp were also overcooked and very difficult to peel. For $9 and 4 shrimp in the appetizer portion, it was highly disappointing. After the double appetizer, we decided to split the Redfish entree with eggplant sticks. The eggplant sticks were actually pretty good. But the fish was a little dry and overcooked. The only saving grace was the sauce that came on it. But even with creamy crawfish sauce, the fish was still a disappointment.

I teetered between a two and three star since the service was good and we enjoyed some things. But since the thing we enjoyed the most was something they didn't even have to cook, two stars is ultimately what this experience was."
3m__ZTwbpH-xm0o2AOSvcw,,"So good, had a dozen raw oysters, raw oyster shot with vodka and cocktail sauce. Also had fried catfish and shrimp. Everything was great.

Their Banana Fosters Cheesecake is TO DIE FOR! If you're in the area, this is a must try. 

The only downside of ACME is that there is a wait. But although the line was out the door and almost at the corner of Bourbon St. it went by relatively quickly. We were told about 45 minutes but it didn't even take 30. I'm glad we waited it out!",

The only problem is I threw away my card the minute I exited the facility. Never again will I eat one. Ok, I won't say never, but I certainly do not intend to have one again any time soon. I consider myself a seafood adventurer. I don't enjoy all the seafood I try, but I'm always up for trying. To put it simply I do not understand the appeal of shooting an oyster raw. It's ""snot"" like consistency is only made worse by its ""straight out of the ocean"" taste.",

Shut out to my waitress who did not let me just order the raw oysters and insisted I must try the charbroiled one and even instructed us on how to properly eat them.  Oh man that was yummy.  And when we couldn't decide what to order for the main meal, she got creative and modified a dish to include multiple options in there for us to get to enjoy as many different options as possible.  The 25 minutes wait time was totally worth it for us.  Loved the food and the service here.  MUST VISIT.",
3oD5T9RVrDuSlrNaZyIgVQ,,,"It's your basic New Orleans bar. I felt like the food was good but it was more bar food but it was anything else. We got the fried oysters but I thought some of the frame in the shower and do things like that but it was out of the shower. They were good, nothing amazing but good. It's mostly batter that's fried with a little moisture inside. We also got the pasta, Cajun/Creole. That was also good but pretty basic. We had to add some spices and salt to it because it needed a little bit more of that but when you're hungry and you want some flavor it's delicious. They have a weird seating system where they don't really take your name and they just call out ""party of two"" And if you're standing outside and someone walks in front of you they could just as easily go. Additionally, there's tons of space upstairs but they make you wait to be seated, I'm not sure why. The service is great as far as the waiter is concerned and he was really nice and fast. It's open late night which is nice. The prices are OK little more expensive than I thought for what it is but when you're hungry and you're in New Orleans and it's late this is a good spot to stop at."
3oJQS8KGwiZjZuE672zw_Q,"Don't be discouraged from the long lines! If you're in the heat, grab some cold water that they provide at the front of the line, it helps! The line overall moves fairly quick, plus the food is worth it. 

After ordering, you can grab your drink and a seat. Remember that it's first come first serve and you can't hold seats. There's both indoor and outdoor seating. Space is limited, but we didn't have any issues finding a seat for 4 after ordering our food. 

I ordered the large white meat combo and it's a great size. I tried the mild and medium, both were really great. I'm usually worried that white meat would be too dry, but that wasn't the case here. I did skip out on all the skin, it was great for the first chicken, but it was a little too much grease for me at some point. My sides included the beans and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was delicious and something I recommend. The beans were just like any other beans, do nothing that's a must have. We ordered the peach cobbler and banana pudding. Both were amazing and I highly recommend giving it a try! The peach cobbler comes out warm and the banana pudding helps smooth out all the heat from the chicken. 

Great place! Must try when visiting Nashville!",,

Fast forward...Check into the hotel, change clothes, walk to Oceana Grill.  No wait (thank goodness because later that day and the next day there was a line down the street).  Seated immediately.  Feeling hungry so we go balls to the wall and order:

Crab Cakes
Gumbo
Seafood Platter
Crawfish Etoufee'

INSANE?!  Yes.  Delicious yes!

Crab Cakes are amazingly round and thick and moist and delish.  Covered in a...wait for it...wait for it....Crawfish and Mushroom cream sauce.  OMG.  Someone just pour the cream sauce down my darn throat!

Gumbo - very tasty.  The only thing I had an issue with was the crab shells.  But yes - I ate the entire cup.

Seafood Platter - Catfish and Shrimp (I don't eat oysters) were deliciously battered and fried to perfection.

Crawfish Etoufee - now I am not the one who ordered this but the friend that did raved for hours about the darned stuff.  It looked yummy.

Service - AMAZING fast service!  It was awesome.  We could barely finish one dish before the other arrived.  Staff was courteous and helpful when it came to decision making.

Drinks - if you order a drink that you give specific direction on : Kettle 1 with pineapple and light ice - it comes out great.  If you order one of theirs - they're not that strong - but tasty like juice.

Overall - amazing and I will go back time and time again.  Oh wait - yes - We went back two days later....."

We didn't order enough because apparently, the portion is small. So we ordered again and we had to wait again. We spent our time here more than 3 hours. The chargrilled oyster was good, the raw oyster wasn't bad. The gumbo is quite good too. I really like the jambalaya. The soft shell crab is good.

It was tasty, but I regretted it. I easily could have nocked it up another notch (or two). Not nearly as frighteningly spicy as advertised.

Ok, that said, this is darn good chicken. This was my first experience with Nashville Hot Chicken. We were in the area visiting family and after seeing all the KFC signs, etc., about Nashville Hot Chicken, I had to try the real-ish thing (I guess Prince's would be the real, real thing). I was pretty happy with the results. The chicken was flavorful and cooked to perfection. And despite the line out the door, Hattie B's took no time to get us our order. There also were quite a few beer choices on tap, which you're not going to find at KFC ;)

I'd definitely recommend Hattie B's if you want to give the Nashville Hot Chicken thing a try. It's just as crowded and busy as everyone says and you'll have to park down the street. But it's tasty stuff. And don't be afraid of the heat if you're a hot and spicy person by nature!",,

I'm not a huge fan of raw oysters, but these chargrilled half shells are on the money. Get a dozen, better yet get two dozens, you won't be disappointed at all. I think they just throw them on the fire, lace them with butter, cheese and some crack. They will have you coming back for more. 

This night I also had the chance to try the sampler which is a good intro to gumbo, jumbalaya and beans/rice.

Aside from oysters, and gumbo they fry everything else too and make sandwiches out of it. Definitely a stop in.",

We had the oysters, in which the sauce tasted like pizza and the oysters were on the small side, the crawfish étouffée, which was a little on the salty side and was not as good as the Real New Orleans Style restaurant in Marble Falls, TX, the seafood gumbo, and the crab cake platter."

Since we both saw things we liked, we decided to give this place a try. We were not disappointed. After we say down, we received a call from my friend's daughter saying they were going to make it into town earlier. Our waiter was nice enough to move us to a four top. 

After an hour wait where I sampled the NOLA Blonde beer (the waiter had never had it so he was nice enough to bring me a sample) and split an appetizer of the fried gator tail bites (AMAZING!), the rest of our party arrived. After ordering, we quickly got our food. My friend had the Mardi Gras pasta and I had the shrimp fettuccine. Both were fabulous. My friend said on more than one occasion how there more seafood than noodles in hers. The two picky eaters we were with raved about the fries.

That's all you need to know about Acme Oyster House.

Sure, the raw oysters are fresh and tasty.  And their fried shrimp platter is pretty good too.  But the only thing you'll care to remember is the plate full of chargrilled oysters.  Topped with cheese and a garlic butter sauce, the chargrilled oysters are sinfully good in that ""Damn, I wish I had ordered a second plate of these instead of my entree"" kind of way.  Our dinner at Acme Oyster House wasn't necessarily the best one we had, but the chargrilled oysters were definitely the best dish that we had.

Oh and in case you hadn't heard, if you go to Acme Oyster House, be prepared to wait.  We thought we could beat the rush by getting there at 5:30 PM.  No dice.  Ended up waiting about 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad all things considered.  Tip: if they offer you a seat at the bar, take it so you don't have to wait any longer to dig into those delicious chargrilled oysters!",

3xPI_fVY8zHwtcUvkX9ByA,,,"We ordered delivery which is always a risk to quality. Ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta which was supposed to have shrimp and alligator sausage. It had two pieces of sausage and reasonable amount of shrimp but it tasted like those frozen cocktail shrimp.

It was also very bland tasting for a Cajun jambalaya. Was expecting way more spice and flavor. Same sentiment for the other dishes my party ordered. The blackened chicken apparently didn't have much flavor either.

Got a bite of the crab cake pasta and that was better but still not as amazing as expected. The crab cake was pretty big and meaty but again the pasta was only mediocre.

We also had a weird delivery mixup where they forgot a gumbo. They said they'd come back and get it to us but it was somehow dropped off at the wrong hotel which is weird. When it finally came, it was also mediocre food. It tastes like gumbo we'd get in like Seattle. 

Honestly food itself is just like a 2.5, rounding down to a 2 with the issues with delivery and timing."

The beers are inexpensive and the food is delicious.  We started with oysters on the half shell and grilled oysters (Oceana's Famous).  These were crazy delicious.  The grilled were better than the raw.  The latter were plump, but mild and needed cocktail sauce/lemon/horseradish.  The former were perfectly seasoned.  

The wife and I both had the red fish special entree.  It was blackened red fish with jalapeño and shrimp sauce that contained some breading.  It was like stuffing.  The server said it was her favorite and really good.  She was right about that.  Our friend ordered the crab cakes.  She fortunately wasn't able to finish them all and I got to eat one the next day.

not a person that ever wants to wait in long lines to eat at some place that all the tourists rave about. Since I'd had this on a weekday once before without any wait a few years ago though, I knew it would be worth the hour wait to order on a weekend afternoon. And I was so right. My fiancé is a pretty harsh critic and he completely agreed as well. The food is delicious, great quality, and cheap. We were staying right across from this Hattie B's so we ended up going twice in one weekend. Pro tip: if you plan ahead by like an hour you can order online, walk in through the back door to pick up the food and avoid the whole long line to order. Some locals also told us that the other locations don't get as crowded as the Midtown one.
I definitely recommend you go there and I Hope next time I can make it there on a Sunday morning so I can try the chicken and waffles!",,

3zxy3LVBV3ttxoYbY4rQ8A,,"This could possibly be a five star joint. But I'll explain later...

So, while in town, I text Gretchen P in Houston (a NOLA native) on dining recommendations. Yes, I browsed Yelp, but there is just too much to choose from in this fair city! She suggested Acme Oyster House. Just two blocks from my hotel, it was a definite go.

Aw hell. Hold up, y'all. There was a 10-plus person line out the door! Much to my surprise, that excited me. ""It must be that good,"" I thought, because right down yonder was another oyster eatery with no wait. Date wasn't too thrilled, but as the hostess walked down the line, I asked how long the wait was: 15-20 minutes ... ""Unless you two want to sit at the bar?"" Hell yes. Straight inside and to the bar we went ... waving goodbye and blowing kisses to the poor saps in line (no, I really didn't do that. But I could have).

And let me tell ya, the bar is the best place to sit. Plenty of elbow room, lots of TVs showing NO college football classics, hooks under the bar to hang your purse and the two friendliest bartenders/servers you could ask for. Tracy and Amanda (I think those were their names; homeboy with long braids and killer green eyes and a sweet gal who lived in Houston after Katrina and told stories about getting lost on the Beltway. ""Houston is too big!"" she said.)

We ordered a half-dozen of the chargrilled oysters. ""You're gonna want the other half,"" Amanda said. I could tell she wasn't trying to upsell us, just being honest. Oh mah gah. She was right! These oysters come out bubbling with seasoned butter and topped with grated Romano cheese and with slices of French bread to sop up all that juice. I could've easily eaten another dozen of these--including the oyster shell. The fire and herby aroma was burned into those shells... I could have if *someone* didn't stop me. Ya hear? Chargrilled oysters at Acme Oyster House are a must. 

Being so popular and with the name ""Oyster House,"" I wanted more oyster flavors and varieties to choose from. Like, broiled oysters with spinach, deep fried oysters with buffalo wing sauce, bacon-wrapped fried oysters with jalapeno ranch. But the only thing they had were fresh, fried, shooters or the chargrilled (once again, amazing). That's the only reason why I deducted one star. Other than that, this place--environment, service and food prep deserved five stars.

Other dishes I recommend are the gumbo (skip the cup and go for the bowl), fried stuffed crab platter ($13.99) which comes with fries, a slice of French bread and your choice of potato salad, slaw or hush puppies. The potato salad certain tasted homemade, with olives, chunks of boiled egg and red potato skins.   

I'll be back to try their crawpuppies and get some more of those chargrilled oysters. And once again. Don't complain about the line. The restaurant is small, but the tables turn fast.

And here are some extra notes, taken from their menu:
An 18% gratuity will be added to parties of 6 or more. 
There is a $1.00 service charge on all to go orders.",

Being that we were not familiar with the food or the restaurant he explained everything and was very patient with all my questions. I definitely appreciated his hospitality. Now to the most important thing.....THE FOOD!!!!! I just can't say enough I had the vegetarian omelette and let me just say even though this is a simple enough dish ppl can and will mess it up. But no not this place! The seasonings were perfection and the blen of veggies they chose were just what I pictured in my food porn dreams!!! lol I do however have one bad thing to say about this place....

THEY DID NOT LET ME KISS THE CHEF!!!! Lol no I didn't ask but I can say I was very disappointed that we came to this place on our last day before heading home.

40IZnu4qgtn_QT-1BESv-w,"'When in Nashville' - right? 

As expected, when we arrived the line was down the street. Thankfully the weather was beautiful so we had no problem waiting for one of the cities most popular spots. By the time we joined the line, to ordering food was 50 minutes, which some of the locals said is fairly standard for a Sunday lunch. 

You have a nice variety on the menu, wings, tenders, sandwiches etc. you can pick your level of 'heat' for your chicken and then your sides. Personally, I chose the tender combo. $10.50. I had 3 tenders (hot), with the bread and pickles, 2 sides (I chose Mac n cheese and baked beans). Once ordered it was easy to see why the long wait. The seating area is fairly small and it's on you to find your own spot. If it's just 1 or 2 people you should be ok squeezing on a table and having a community meal, however, if you're in a group of 4 or more... you're probably going to struggle for a while. 

The food was delivered to our table after about 10 minutes. Immediately I was shocked at the size of the chicken tenders. They looked AMAZING. The tenders are laid on a slice of bread, with 2 pickle chips speared through the top and the sides in separate tubs. 

The chicken was breaded, seasoned and cooked to perfection. The hot seasoning was perfect for me because it was hot enough that it made my nose run a little, but not so hot that I couldn't enjoy it. With there being so much, I got through 2 and a half tenders before I had to tap out. It was worth standing in line for. 

Now for the negatives.... which I hate to do because the chicken was so good. Throughout the weekend we are at a lot of places and ate a lot of Mac n cheese. Unfortunately the Mac n cheese at Hattie B's was some of the worst I've ever had in my life. The pasta itself was so soft and soggy, it felt like it had been cooked for an hour, while the cheese was so thin, runny and flavorless. The baked beans were fairly similar. They were delivered in what almost seemed like water, and lacked flavor. 

Now I know this is a chicken spot.... and based on their chicken.... it was fantastic!  And the prices were phenomenal too. I would like to go back on day if I'm in the city.","Yelp strikes again! We were fortunate enough to be staying with a minute walking distance of Acme, so it was convenient as it was high on our list of 'must-do's' while in the city. There is a sign outside to form a line, but fortunately we were brought straight in. As we walked through, It genuinely felt like we had been transported to another country. From the mirrored walls, red neon lighting, open kitchen area, cramped, elbow to elbow tables, it has an awesome hustle and bustle vibe. 

Depending on your group size, you may end up sharing a table with another group (end to end, not sitting facing each other don't worry). Our server came almost immediately and told us about the specials before taking our drink order. We had looked at the menu before going so we were already kinda sure as to what to get.

We got an appetizer of the boom boom shrimp. It's a generous serving of fried shrimp in a sauce. I want to say it was a creamy-ish mildly hot sauce with blended flavors. Whatever it was, it was ridiculously good and disappeared fast! For my main course I had been torn on a few items, so I chose to go with the New Orleans Medley. Gumbo - amazing. Red beans and rice - great (standard). Cajun sausage - great spice. Jambalaya- awesome! While each item was a smaller due to being the medley, it was surprisingly filling. For a person eating alone, you can comfortably eat for under $20. 

As we left, a line had developed outside about 10 deep, so when I see other people writing about having to wait... they aren't lying. We just happened to get lucky! 

Overall, I would argue that it was the best meal I had during my 4 days in New Orleans.",
40Pyq1SP1MP9VeHUBgUfDw,,"My first visit to Acme did not disappoint. Based on Yelp reviews we wanted to give the restaurant a try. 

We started with the oyster shot. I took it down like a pro. The vodka was a little harsh and left an aftertaste. 

Next I tried the fried alligator. Trying to be adventurous (but hoping it taste like chicken). The alligator was actually good.... and taste like chicken maybe chewy chicken. Would I order it again? YES!!

For my entree, I ordered the crab cake with fries & hush puppies. The crab cake met my expectations but I had to ask for sauce to eat it with. The hush puppies were ""meh"" in my opinion. 

Overall great dining experience and the wait to be seated was worth it.",
40ufEP63b6Dl_eG1eYJZSA,,"Oh my god. The char-broiled oysters. Get them. I insist.

Why are the oysters in LA so much better than the ones in CA (which are pretty great)? One of the great mysteries of the universe.

Also, great jambalaya. And fish. And I loved the ""craw puppies."" The beans and rice were a little bland for my taste, but that's why God invented hot sauce. 

Okay, so it's small compared to other legendary places in the quarter, but worth the long wait. Try to go during off hours. There's a line no matter what time you go, but it's shorter during off times. Once you finally get seated, the service is great. It's lively in there. You can tell the hard-working staff all like each other, always a good sign.

I don't get what all the hype is about. Drinks took forever coming from the bar, and they were pretty weak to boot. We ordered a dozen oystersto start, what came to the table was 10.5,with chips of shell in most of them. On the New Orleans sampler, the gumbo wasn't really edible, with any amount of various hot sauces; the red beans and rice were bland, and the jambalaya and sausage were pretty good.The Peace maker Po-boy, I'll hand it to them, delicious! Great flavor, and very generous on the portion.

Service was spotty at best, and it took a while to get our check, and then the credit card run. And when we looked at our bill, instead  of being charged for a dozen oysters (10.5) we were charge for a dozen & 1/2dozen.

I had the chicken alfredo but subbed in blackened chicken and it was nothing less than amazing - the Alfredo is definitely from scratch and the blackened chicken just took it up a notch. I also added a crab cake to my meal and it was very good. My sister for the special, stuffed salmon on rice with greens and she said it was great. My BIL got the crawfish/creole pasta (I think?) and he liked his as well - I didn't try it. The one downside to our meal was the rolls they served with the pasta, they were pulled straight from a package not even warmed up (we had food a plenty so it was not a big deal by any means, but it made us laugh since everything else was superb). The service was great, we didn't wait too long for our meal or drinks. We will definitely be back next time we are here and will highly recommend."

For its price, Acme worths every penny. $10 for a dozen of freshly shucked oyster is pretty decent. But don't pay extra for the baked ones, they are not as good.

I never walked out of Acme paying more than $20

Avoid the long lines, remember to get there early, before 5pm, get some oysters, local ""amber"" beer (i forgot the name), then walk around Bourbon St and go somewhere for your real dinner.

Stick with the seafood the jambalaya was also good when I tried a little bit of that from my cousin's plate.  Go early or expect a wait.

43pTJtTZA1qbsjeRWozYJQ,"As a guy who does not like Hot Food, I love Hattie B's. I get my chicken mild and it is perfect. There's still a little bit of spice, but I don't have to drink an entire glass of water after every bite. 

On the other hand, the folks i know that do like spicy get the ""shut the cluck up"" and then immediately sweat out the calories they just finished eating. so there's something for everyone.

Save some $$ and bring a date to split the large plate. its basically two meals for 11 bucks, so unless you're a human garbage disposal, it's the perfect meal to split with another person. 

Also, be a good citizen and drink the local beers.",,

It was more than worth it !! The chicken was perfectly seasoned. I had the medium heat, she had the hot. Spice lovers may want to go for the hot. The medium was just right for a non spice lover, but still curious. The collard greens lacked in flavor, the MAC was amazing though! Sweet tea was decent as well. Definitely would recommend this spot.",,

45TCyloULRVQ5VF0R-hV7g,"While I gave this a 3 star rating, I mean to say that the food is good but I wouldn't go out of my way to find and eat at this place.  I visited here because I was driving to Florida and this place had been reviewed and rated in an online article on yahoo as really great.  

I ordered the small white chicken dinner, medium heat, with greens and coleslaw as my sides. I ordered these sides because they are the quintessential southern sides.  The price was very reasonable.  

The chicken was excellent. It comes as a single chicken breast and wing (i think they refer to this as a quarter of a chicken).  It was well cooked, juicy, and had a deep brown crispy skin with a coating that wasn't heavy...just properly light and not greasy at all.  The coating/skin had a slight sweetness and was medium spice exactly as described.  The coating tasted like a good barbecue potato chip!  Really good.   

The greens were not at all spicy, had no meat, and while they were good, there were essentially just cooked greens.  

The coleslaw was forgettable - nothing special about it.  The dressing had nothing to make it special.  It was barely noticeable because there was so little in the salad mix.  I say skip it unless you're on a diet. 

Clearly the chicken was the star and is the focus of Hattie B's reputation.  

I ate inside and the place is small but clean and probably could accommodate 50 people.  They did have an outdoor covered patio eating area.",,

47EOJmGkKpzuwo4D734xhg,"Hattie B's is an above average fried chicken joint. 

Don't buy into the hyperbole of the Yelp reviews. I read these reviews beforehand and the image was conjured that some magician-turned-cook was reaching up into the high heavens and pulling down Fried Food Fit for the Gods and selling it for $10 to $15. The reviews are so hyperbolic that you'd think this can't even be chicken anymore - maybe Hattie B has discovered some animal in the Smoky Mountains that tastes like chicken yet is even better. 

Nope.

Lets start with the positives because you won't corral this many Yelp Elites without something special and distinctive. 

The secret sauce is the fried breading on the chicken. It's special and above average. It's thin and crispy in a distinctive way. The heat doesn't burn the tongue. It's a flare and then simmers - but still noticeable. Similar to Sriracha. You should probably get a drink. 

The sides are above average too. I got the black bean salad, potato salad, pimento mac and cheese, and banana pudding. That's a lot of food and only cost $17. I figured yolo. When you see this many Yelp Elite reviewers raving, it's kind of like a cosmic star alignment where you push the boundaries. 

The mac n' cheese is creamy without being too cheesy. Highly recommended. Black bean salad. Good with curious accents. Potato salad is just solid and good. 

To keep this in perspective, Hattie B's is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that serves fried food fast (sans line). High customer volume, high turnover, with short preparation time. It's a good distinctive fast food experience. It's one of the better fried chickens I've tried. It's not a transformative experience that redefines your understanding of fried chicken. At least for me. 

There's a good chance I'll be back again, although I am in no rush.

Now here's why I give this place a B: My two main gripes: Outside of the breast, there ain't enough meat (that's why you should get the tenders or chicken breast meal). And although I got the medium it's pretty spicy and that distracted me from my enjoyment. The spiciness is also not a perfect blend with the fried chicken, where two essences mingle perfectly.

Here's what you need to know: Expect a wait, regardless what time of day you come out. Gratefully, I only had to wait 40 minutes. You have to hunt for parking so bring quarters. There is cheap metered parking but some parking lots charge $10. Don't use a parking lot.

It's good and worth the wait - but I don't think this is a bucket list foodie stop.

As a self-regarded high connoisseur of crap food (junk food), I appreciated the stop because it shed new light on fried chicken. But I don't feel it accomplishes the majesty and heights and full potential of what fried chicken can be.",,
47HGPFwrPYlE5no5olFztQ,"I went to Nashville for the Hot chicken and the Whiskey, which I accomplished. Hattie B's was on my "" to eat list"" and did not disappoint. Sure there's a bit of line but all good things you do have to wait.

visited Hattie B's couple times to Midtown location
Ordered:
Tenders Medium heat 
Sides:
mac & cheese
coleslaw x 2
black eye pea salad
extra pickles 
must try the come back sauce

the chicken was so juicy and tender, not sure how they do, but god bless them. 
All the sides were flavorful, but the black eye pea salad and coleslaw were my favorite.

I got the hot chicken sandwich with mac and cheese.The mac and cheese was bomb-super creamy and flavorful. I expected there to be really good mac and cheese everywhere in the south but I only enjoyed the one from Hattie B's. The sandwich itself was good but didn't live up to the hype. I got the hot spice level but didn't think it was that spicy at all. The chicken was cooked well and it was a pretty sizable sandwich.

48frnroabupeTYxrZZvbIA,"Oh gosh. For real. I haven't been this impressed with a food place in a long time. Really, despite having high expectations because of the hype the place still blew my socks off. Don't let the hype or long lines make you think that this is just some tourist trap. It's not. It's completely legit. Also, don't be intimidated by the ""hot chicken"" spice if you aren't into heat - they have plenty of options including non-spicy. The flavor and preparation of the food was perfect - it's not just all about the heat.

I ended up placing an order online 30 minutes before I arrived at lunchtime on a super busy Saturday. I walked right in past the long line that stretched down the block. The employees at the counter were super nice and engaged in small talk with me despite them being in super busy mode. They were fantastic. It's like they legitimately enjoy their jobs and they like their customers. So awesome. My food was brought out and I ate elsewhere. The dining area is quite small but there is a decent sized patio but you're still going to have a wait during peak times.

Ok the food: I ordered a chicken breast quarter which was very big with the wing attached. Heat level ""damn hot"" which is second to the top of the heat range. The heat was noticable and it would be a kick to someone not a fanatic about spice. I would recommend maybe level 2 to the typical person. The chicken was so good. I ordered it ""fried hard"" which made it super crispy but it was still very moist. So impressed. The flavors were great. That flavor profile is quite unique and tasted so good.  I also ordered a few grilled chicken tenders to try and they were great too. The grilled tenders would be a great choice for someone wanting to avoid fried chicken.

I didn't get any sides but they have plenty of choices that all looked really good.

You have to try Hattie B's if you are in the area. It really is the real deal.",,
48w8IAwfeATiR3rfuH6ouw,,"Everyone talks about the oysters, which are as good as they say, but there are some other amazing, yummy foods you can't miss at Acme. 

Their po-boys are fantastic. I has my first-ever po-boy at Acme and got a combination of catfish and shrimp. I thought I had died and gone to fried fish heaven. Just writing about it makes me want to jump on a plane and go back for more. My husband enjoyed a roast beef po-boy, but to me, it's all about the fish here. Oh, and their fries kick butt too! 

Prices here are dirt cheap. The beers, the food, it was a welcome change from the likes of New York City. 

I wasn't a fan of the oyster shooter - I was expecting it packed tight in a shot glass. This was in a like a bathroom dixie cup and swam all around my cheap vodka. But you get what you pay for at less than $2. 

The atmosphere is casual and the restaurant provides lots of seating for large groups or a party of two. 

Be prepared to wait on a line outside, even during off-peak hours. Grab a beer and enjoy yourself while you wait to be seated (and make sure your entire party is present) - you're about to have one of your best meals in New Orleans!!!",

I may have to get some chicken to take home!",,
4AYfs8d7M2H4TBEiHhHTdQ,"Hattie B's... hot, or not. Definitely HOT!!! This is the BEST fried chicken I've ever had!! My friends, brother, and I came to Nashville for Yelp Spring Break and our research lead us to this place! It is so good that I would come to Nashville again, just to eat here! We were in Nashville for a week during Yelp Spring Break and we ate here 3 times! 

I recommend ordering the large dark as for an extra $2 compared to the small dark plate, you get an extra thigh and leg. You also get your choice of 2 sides and each order also comes with bread. It's perfect for sharing as you can order different levels of spiciness for each piece. What I did was order 2 pieces the spicy level I wanted with one side that I wanted, while my brother choice the other 2 pieces and his choice of side. It's cheaper than ordering a small plate for each person and it's only 50 cents to add an extra side. There are 5 levels of spicy ranging from no spicy to Shut the Cluck up. Between my brother and I and being there 3 times in one week, we tried all the levels of spiciness. Medium is about the hotness level that I can handle, which is only one above no spice. The Hot was a little too hot for me and the highest level of spice - Shut the Cluck Up is waaaaay spicy! You better make sure your stomach can handle it if your mouth can handle that level of spicy! For the sides, I only tried the fries and mac and cheese. Both were good. Fries are crispy and tasty and the mac and cheese was also tasty. 

The chicken, like I said is by far the BEST fried chicken I've ever had! My friends and brother agreed too! It was so crispy and tasty and juicy! Seriously, we ate here 3 times in one week because it was THAT good! We even ordered some to take on the place back to California with us... and it was still good when we got back to California! The workers here are very friendly and will help you order if you do not know how. You can order your meal and say you order a large dark plate that comes with 4 pieces, you can order each of those pieces at a different level of spicy if you want. 

Parking here is madness as the parking lot is super tiny. Seating is also not that plentiful but the people we met were friendly, so make friends and share a table! I like that drinks are out so you can refill it yourself. I'm glad that the chicken also comes with bread because if you order the spicier chicken, you'll be glad that bread is there! 

Hattie B's is so good that I would come to Nashville just to eat here! I've been craving Hattie B's since leaving Nashville and still craving it. The only thing they really serve here is fried chicken, but trust me, they do it right!! Hattie B's is not just hot, it's smoking hot!! Oh Hattie B's, I miss your fried chicken!!",,

My wife got the Cajun jambalaya pasta which was excellent as well, and we split the crabfish cakes, they were so phenomenal that I forgot to take a picture. Our friends got the blackened duck which was moist and full of flavor. 

For dessert we got the banana pudding which was out of this world and the chocolate mousse cake which was very decadent smooth and very filling.

4DN9WS2gf7Y2SYh0LaqDqA,,"Life always beckons for answers to certain questions. True, we ditched the ACME line the first time but we weren't able to get away before having our minds imprinted with the phrase, ""Is it WORTH it? Is this place REALLY WORTH it?"" Yes, it is Bourbon Street and there are always drunk peeps running around doing *interesting* things. Although this guy was obviously plastered (as he sure staggered and slurred), his question remained nonetheless LEGIT. (Side note: same guy was picked up by paramedics much later...)

So second time around - this time with friends (with one FROM Louisiana) - we decided to find out the truth behind this establishment by dining there and appeasing our curiosity about the endless line.

40'ish minutes waiting in line + 20'ish of dining...here's the VERDICT:

1. Answering the drunk dude's question: NOT worth lining up for unless you're curious what the fuss is about. This place is OVER-RATED...even among tourist traps.

2. CHARRED oysters...would be the better name for what came out of the halfway burnt mess. 80% tastes dairy...and carbon.

3. Raw oysters - same supplier, same size, same price...shucked okay with leftover grit.

4. Po-Boys SUCK...which is kinda expected in an oyster bar. Friends (esp our Louisiana friend) hated their sampler plate...esp the rice and beans.

5. You can really tell that they are trying to turn tables fast. Not complaining...just telling you to expect it.

I'd skip this place if you see a long line. If you really still want to try it so you can tell your friends about it (like we did)...BRING ENOUGH BEER to keep you occupied.

#FreakingLoveNOLA","I don't recall anyone giving a recommendation about this place. Neither did the establishment itself look anywhere inviting. If anything, I thought it looked like some lame joint that had really weird lighting effects and filled with crazies invoking voodoo magic to empty out the wallet of anyone unaware. However, before I was able to drag the lady along and away down Bourbon Street...the main door swung open and out stampeded a large group of about 20+ happy-looking diners quickly exiting and scattering into the night seeking more action.

Yet, one diner was not quick to disappear like the rest. Not only did he hold the door open for the outgoing stampede...he also continued to hold it open for us with a smile and beckoned that we enter by saying ""AMAZING FOOD...get in and enjoy!"" I swear no extra persuasion was needed after that scene and we both entered expecting that this place would at least be ""okay"" if a group that huge had just left with satisfied looks.

Well, friendliness greeted us, sat us, gave us menus, and made us immediately feel welcome. Service was eager to please from the start and was matched with an efficient kitchen that set out piping hot dishes shortly after the order was placed. I didn't particularly like the ambiance - especially the lighting - and greasy floors have always peeved me. But this all is secondary...we only care about the food right?

I forgot to order any form of oysters here - that's my fail. I did, however, order stuff I didn't order elsewhere: (a) Cajun Alligator Sausages were just a tube of meaty grease. Beef is added to offset the lean gator meat; however, the beef also dominated the flavor profile. I'd say to skip this one and (b) turtle soup...I'd also skip this one unless you are just craving a bowl of chili. Once again, all the other ingredients just dominate the flavor profile that you wouldn't be able to tell if contained turtle or rat or cow or horse or DRAGON.

The entrees, however, are worth a revisit. My fair lady ordered the Taste of New Orleans, which contained the main staples - jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red rice and beans, and a sausage to top it off. We welcomed the intense flavors with absolute delight and cleaned the plate to a shiny clean hue. I ordered the catfish special, which came blackened and topped off with fried crawfish tails and a side of steamed veggies. This was easily the highlight of the meal...while there was enough crawfish tails to make another dish, it was the amazingly seasoned and properly cooked catfish that blew our minds away as each piece melted-away-in-our-mouth!

Nashville is the home of hot chicken and Hattie B's is mecca. It would be sacrilegious to give them anything but a 5 star, if not for reputation alone 

Not all reviews need to be 1000 words, and this one of them. Good sides, lots of beverage choices, and no joke, some of the best flavored and most well fried chicken out there.

The only negative about Hattie's is that the secret is out and the lines are insane. If you're an out of towner, do yourself the favor and don't come to this location, especially around lunch time. Go to one of the other locations about 5 miles away.

All were soooo good. Probably the best macaroni I've ever had. My husband got the medium tenders and they were almost too hot for him to handle. Definitely get them to tell you the difference in peppers used for each level of heat. Overall we had a great experience and hope to visit again.",,

We ordered chargrilled oysters, red beans & rice, cajun fries, and a cheeseburger. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the entire experience! The waitress was very attentive (Lakeisha), the drinks and food were ordered and presented in less than 20mins! This place is a gem!"
4FDf9wYYEwf3QncEoSBfhQ,,,"So we went to Oceana for some late night food as we were hungry around midnight. The food was honestly good, not great but the service was on point!

Our server was beyond friendly, gave recommendations, and kept the party going by trying to get us to order doubles for our drinks. 

I really enjoyed the eggplant fries and the fried shrimp. The shrimp has a really good seasoning with just a bit of spice so they were a hit. 

The crab cakes were not my favorite because they were like breaded and fried but the crawfish sauce they top them with was awesome. 

Overall if you want late night food try them out but if it's earlier enough in the day, maybe check out another place."
4Fxp3tOe0svDqB0VQyV9zA,,,"Really liked the food here but it was so dang expensive for what you get, even at lunch time.

As for the fried chicken, the mild one is not that special, but the hot one is pretty unique. Be warned for those who does not eat spicy food often, please try mild first. I didn't dare to try dream spicy. Perhaps for the next time. 

If you want to pair it with beer, try lighter beer instead of dark.",,

The charbroiled oysters were to die for. We made the mistake of only ordering 1/2 dozen. Don't be stupid like us, get the full 12 lol. Our server was Morris and he was awesome! He was super nice and very attentive. The food there is so flavorful and they have the best hush puppies I have ever had.",
4Gl9yUf3RbSC3a1LpvgOYg,,,"Ask to sit upstairs. Delightful ambiance. 

Good solid 4 star place on Yelp.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it is AND to compensate for a few awful 1 star reviews. How can some tell the seafood was frozen? I am no expert but nothing we had tasted ""fishy"" which is, to me. my life long deciding point. The crab, shrimps, fried oysters were all premium to our palates. Gumbo, good to the last drop. Red beans and rice? Heavenly smokey taste and velvety smooth. This is not Popeye's. Fried oysters, superb! A hint of spicy breading, lots of them on more French fries that I can eat. We could not finish our portions.

Our waiter Val paid attention to our table, without being annoying, which is right on. He was pleasant, humorous. By the time we departed, after meeting management, it was all handshakes. Can't wait to go back.

Special note: While we may be Pennsylvania residents now, we lived in Houston over 2 decades. I worked for a Shreveport company for two years with positions in New Orleans and Lake Charles. We are not strangers to Cajun and Creole cuisine. There will always be a special place  in our hearts for Louisiana, it's colorful people and their zesty lifestyle and foods."

We were all very satisfied with our food. The line outside can be discouraging, but stay with it because it moves along pretty quickly. Our server was really nice and attentive and took really good care of us. If you're in the city I recommend this place as I'm sure you couldn't go wrong with any menu item. The place stays busy and now I know why. Great food and great service.","Tried this spot for lunch and ordered the cheeseburger with cajun fries. My burger was really good. It was big in size and had all the fixings you'd expect. The fries were definitely a new experience for me as I was expecting cajun seasoning, not crawfish gravy lol. They were really good though. Cheesy and gooey. I used my Yelp discount and they actually went ahead and discounted all of us at the table which I thought was really great of them. My coworkers had crab cakes and alligator, etc. I just wanted something regular and simple, but we all enjoyed our food."

Each plate came with three strips of chicken and two sides for $18! We got mild & truth be told it was hot! If you just keep eating it doesn't burn so bad -- sauces are also available: ranch, blue cheese & honey mustard which help cut the heat. We also forgot to order the banana pudding, but the waitress was awesome & said she'd get it for us if we had the $3.23, which we managed to scrounge together! This place is worth the hype.",,

4HvIzTHB9o-aI6M8IO3SPQ,"Hattie B's is fantastic. 

Everyone said there'd be a wait but the line moved quite quickly. 

I was in town for the weekend and opted for the Hot Chicken Sandwich. The big question is how hot you want your chicken as it's all delicious, the breading is super tasty and the chicken is perfectly cooked. I like spicy foods so I went with Spicy but could've definitely gone with the Damn Spicy option, especially in the sandwich where the sauce and slaw help negate the spice. 
That being said, I've heard the Shut the Cluck Up heat is brutal so maybe don't go all the way.

One last thing - that banana pudding. Incredible. Perfect texture, delicious flavor. Would go back just for the pudding.

Can't wait to return.",,

Fried shrimp, which comes with 5 shrimp, red beans and rice which was soooooo good! And a side of fried crawfish and they were soft, the right texture and delicious. We'll definitely be back here before we leave. Also our server Ashleigh was very attentive!"

We ordered chargrilled oysters, a crawfish po-boy, hush puppies and the boo fries. All were absolutely phenomenal! We also ordered a few different drinks which our bartender, Curtis, made really well. We took our time to enjoy our food and drinks and did not feel rushed to finish despite the growing line outside. Prices were on the higher side but weren't ridiculous either.

4IMXLvuomW_VLO_ZeoubKQ,,,"New Orleans this time was just unusual for me . I have been here a few times but this trip just showed me the spirit of this city . 
After 8 Hours drive on a rainy day with my family (includes a Furkid) was hoping to eat my fav southern lunch . Called the restaurant to check if they would  have some place to seat us as we were there with our dog.. the manager was so kind to seat us inside with our dog as it was raining outside.
We ordered the famous charbroiled oysters with gator bites and southern fries . Quantity of fries was quite a lot . We loved the gator fries and oysters quite a lot . Oyster was sizzling when it arrived on our table . 
I did not like the hurricane as much but other than tat the food was amazing. 
I would give them special stars for taking care of our dog when we arrived , treating him with love ."

4IoHrY7Df4wjOrjoyn5YtA,,,"Tldr: food was solid 3-4 stars but a giant cockroach flew down from the ceiling onto my shoulder during dinner, and the staff handled it so poorly. I want all visitors to know about it. 

I am not going to talk too much about the food. We ordered the cajun fries, NO favorites, redfish and bread pudding.  They were tasty.

The real kicker of the story here started when we got done ordering our food.  I felt something smack against the side of my face. When I reached for it, I felt it move down onto the table.  We then realized that there was a 3 inch long roach right there on our table crawling around. I jumped out of my seat right away because I am absolutely terrified of roaches. A few moments later, the staff came by, and ""took care of it"".  We changed table but I was so traumatized that the rest of the dinner was less than enjoyable.  

Our young waiter came and was somewhat apologetic about it.  He even told me about a time a roach jumped down his shirt. Thanks for that mental image...not. We ate our dinner and then came the bill.  I was so surprised to see our bill charged as full, given to us without another word of apology. No, no, no.. I asked to speak with the manager, and came a gentleman wearing a red tie.  I explained the incident to him calmly, and he explained that the restaurant passed all health checks and that they have no control over the court yard where the roaches can come from.  Um... did he just try to justify this?  I pressed on and said how is a roach landing on your customer INSIDE the restaurant an expected outcome of dining here? And then he got defensive and said that roaches can fly wherever they want and there isn't anything he can do.  I was furious at that point. Not because a roach landed on me, but because this manager thought my poor dining experience in his restaurant was not his problem.  A few more rounds back and forth, he suggested a 10% discount and free dessert.  I didn't think he was going to be more sympathetic than that so we paid the bill and left with a bitter taste in our mouths.  With so many good places nearby, I cannot recommend anyone to dine here if you care about good dining experience. YIKES."

Red to make the line. I had a dozen charbroiled oysters; they were delicious. I also tried the side of jambalaya and the boo fries. The boo fries were fantastic. My husband had a Pepsi and I had a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was pretty good. By the time we left the line to come in was even longer.,

I will caution that the sides are pretty poor.  Bland mac n' cheese and coleslaw particularly grate on my nerves.  But the real problem is the service. The Charlotte location is run by hipsters who obviously feel you're lucky to be graced by their oh so hip presence.  They won't allow people (even people with two children under 3 years old) to wait inside the restaurant for food, even when there are 20 tables open, for some undetermined reason.  They give you the wrong take out orders, then attempt to blame you for it (again for an undetermined reason).  The chicken is pretty good, but going through the rigamarole to get it is almost not worth it.",,
4Jl0hMqNr1uZ5vkSnIWhuQ,"Bruh. I went to Nashville with 6 close friends from high school and this is the first place we went to go eat at. Being adventurous and trying to challenge myself, I ordered the 2nd to the hottest flavor of chicken. I can usually take on spicy without a problem but...yo when I took a bite of this chicken my mouth was on fire and my stomach was hurting midway through as I was digesting this chicken. I ordered 2 pieces, and after finishing the first one, I packed the other one to go and just ate potato salad and cole slaw to cool my mouth down. However, it was a good experience!!! I'd say if you are out there in Nashville, you have to go try it. Oh, also we went on a Thursday night and it was STILL crowded. This place had a line outside the door and we also were strugglin out there to find parking lol. #GoodFood #AlmostDiedTho",,

Not only was everything overcooked over fried and over priced we had a Bad waitress who didn't give a shit or cared wether she wanted to be there or if we were happy, the telling tale that we came to realize on some of the NOLA dives are the fact that some of the locals seem fed up during peak hours at dealing with the rush, but the amazing food quality in this city makes it worth it, just not at this location!! Not worth it!",
4K4mEl7d5MAu-zcCLCVI-g,,"With almost 300 reviews there probably isn't much I can say about ACME that hasn't already been said but:

OH MY GOD, THE GRILLED OYSTERS ARE DELICIOUS! 

... and this is coming from someone who does not particularly care for Oysters! 

Seriously, if you go, get two dozen, you won't regret it. 

I also had the Peace Maker Po'boy (exactly what a Po'boy should be) and my friend had the Soft Shell crab.  All served, hot, quick and was pretty reasonably priced for such a area mainstay. 

Only docking a star because they don't take reservations and the wait can be a little long.  Fortunately, like any good French Quarter establishment, they will let you go in and get your cocktails in ""go cups"" to keep you warm (or cool) while you wait! 

Seriously, those oysters are the real deal.",
4K5HvzU-_QAxsuWG0nKlUQ,"Not worth the wait. From what I can remember, the sides like black eyed pea salad was wretched. Baked beans tasted like what you get out of a can. Chicken wasn't anything to write home about. Fries were like McCain's frozen crinkle fries. Sliced bread that came with it was...sliced white bread. Very very average food that is way overhyped. There's probably better hot chicken in Toronto. The only positive was the young lady at the register who knew her stuff. I would definitely check out another hot chicken spot when I'm in Nashville again.",,
4K6vw0MrLcWmXWEJDQsyuQ,,A totally disappointing experience.  I have been visiting NOLA for years and last night's dinner was dialed in. The raw oysters were served warm and flavorless.

Upon my visit to Hattie B's, I went to three other places for hot chicken. I thought all was good until I ate a piece of Hatties. I told my friend, now this is what HOT CHICKEN is suppose to taste like. WOW, it was juicy, flavorful, crispy and just amazing. The others places did not compare at all. 

I got the Nashville hot. Perfect for me. But my friend thought it was too spicy for her. She got mild. As for the sides, mac and cheese was so good and fries too. Everything was just great. Finished my whole meal. I wish I ordered the banana pudding or peach clobber. Now I need to make a visit back to Nashville just for HATTIE! 

I was here on a holiday Monday, President day around 11:15am. It was about a 50 min wait. Since they open at 11, I think its better to arrive after 12 or later.

It was so tender and so perfectly crisp, with the white bread intelligently placed under the chicken as a delicious catch for the left over flavor I didn't want to leave in the basket. 10/10, would eat again.

Make sure you get the chargrilled oysters as well as the original. Both are off the charts and they have some of the biggest oysters we have ever seen!

Would skip the fried osyters as most of the natural flavors seemed to be lost during frying.

Po'boys are okay, if we could do it again we would skip these as well and get more oysters.",

I also had the seafood gumbo cup. Lots of seafood flavor and i really enjoyed it considering I'm usually kind of impartial to gumbo.

We came on a Thursday around 5:20pm and waited just less than 20 min for a seat at the bar for two. There were plenty of groups ahead of us who had been waiting longer for a table though.

I can give you guys a review of their grilled chicken tenders.  Those things were grilled perfectly and this sauce whore gives two enthusiastic thumbs up for their honey mustard sauce.

I got here around 6pm before going to a show over at Bridgestone Arena.  The place had a line out the door, but it wasn't as bad as the line when I departed.  The wait was only about 10-15 minutes.  You wait in line, order at the counter and pray to your deity that there is an open space for your party to sit their butts down.  My group cheated and snagged a table while we were still ordering.  There weren't any signs saying this was a no-no so I think it's ok.

I got super excited about all the food I was going to consume that I ordered all of the food and neglected to tell the cashier that I needed my chicken tenders to be grilled instead of fried.  Someone in the group caught my mistake and I went back to the cashier.  She was already working on a different order, but said no problem to the grilled chicken request.

You get two sides when you order meals here.  I went with the baked beans and the potato salad.  I have to say that the sides were pretty bad.  Bad as in I stopped eating them halfway through my meal even though I was hungry enough to devour them.  The potato salad was really bland and had this off-putting sour taste to it that made my lips pucker.  Almost as if the food was sour in a way past its expiration date sour.  The baked beans also did not taste that good.  This made me sad, but the great chicken outweighed the sad face caused by the sides.

All in all, this was probably a 3 star experience, but they get an extra star bump for offering a grilled option.",,

All and all I have this place 3 stars because for the wait and the lack of atmosphere, you expect the food at a place like this to be the main draw and it just didn't live up to the hype ( which was, to be fair, high).

1. Hollywood our server and master oyster shucker was the absolute BEST. Friendly, funny, exciting, teacher. Not only did he keep me and my guest entertained but the ladies next to us. Great hospitality and customer service.
2. Boom Boom shrimp very good. 
3. Fish platter was omg so good. Swia fish my new 1st choice of fish. Even the fries were super good. 
4. Hurricane was ok. Not a fan of sweet drinks. But it was strong how i like my drinks.

5. Biggest disappointment the crab cake and margarita.  Crab cakes are all filling. Tasted like frozen boxed food from the supermarket. Not flavorful at all. Margarita had too much sour mix. Finding a bartender that blends a good margarita is really hard to find.

Overall I say go try and experience for yourself. My rating would have been a 4 or 5 but that crabcake took points away. Hollywood and the fish get all the cool points and praise for this review. I would go back just to see him. LOL!!","Came on a Saturday at 11pm. There was a line but was seated in 10 min. Food was ok. I got  the fisherman's platter. The hush puppies were hard and overcooked. The catfish was actually very good. So were the shrimp but too much batter.  The texture of the fried oysters were weird. 

I also got the raw oysters. They were fresh and meaty. Very good. 

The customer service was friendly but slow.  The air conditioning was on too high. It was freezing. 

I would not go back but would tell others to try for themselves"

4N4QuOU6F4kK9V8arjI5cQ,,,This place was very good the portion sizes was great the atmosphere was great the waiter staff was very knowledgeable about the menu they guided me and navigatedme into new tasteful experiences that were delightful surprisingly good. They also gave some historical context about the meal we choose.Jimika  our waiter was wonderful experience and I end up giving her a $20 tip. Even though the meal was priced out of around $63 for two I am a big guy about 300 pounds and I know how to eat. This is a must try must experience restaurant.
4N7mE2yCLSLFHV3gbHHJXw,,Boo Fries  OMG - the oysters are always over the top. Loud and crazy with the game on but always one of our stops when in. NOLA,
4NF-pbxRmL8RDmQIJ79J7Q,Very good chicken! Expect huge pieces of chicken. The line has been out to the street the entire time we waited and ate our meal. It's well worth the wait.,,
4NdWHUElIAWjypOwYjcOag,,,The food was great! I believe the flavor is was amazing but if they seasoned the fish a little more before adding their signature flavor it would be infused in and out of the fish I got! I ate the Redfish Oceana!
4Ney6ejyu6p9uZN-vfj7OQ,,Food was amazing. Service is a bit lacking but that's because it is super super busy but the food is amazing! So tasty. If you are in New Orleans you must try out this place!!!! Trust me it's worth the wait!,
4Nu0dXmJSbZFi3OWD04lwQ,"Well worth the hype. The chicken sandwich and dark meat plate were superb. Get them HOT not medium, not mild.

Sweat tea was delicious and so were the mac and cheese and turnips. Fries were crispy and flavorful, unlike other fries in the south.",,
4NwEksMVwjYvTvoxHRxlaQ,,,"We had a reservation through the website that I'd made a couple of weeks in advance. When I called to confirm, the guy said they do not take reservations. I even had an email confirmation of the reservation! We went anyway, because we wanted to try it. The line was out the door and there were probably 25 people in front of us, but we did not have to wait long. We let the host know about the reservation situation, and she apologized and seated us as soon as possible, so I appreciate that.
The food was pretty good. I ordered the crab cakes and they were WONDERFUL. The sides (mashed potatoes and greens) weren't all that great, but not bad. Our table shared an order of Oceana's Famous Oysters and they were awesome also. The sauce that is on them is something I would eat by the bowl!! We ordered a bottle of champagne for the table and it was not good at all. Not very cold, and a little flat. 
 Our server was not great. We had to wait for drinks, he forgot a couple items from our orders (one we cancelled because he still had not brought out by the time we were almost finished eating). 
 I will likely visit again and hopefully the experience with the server will be a better one."

Just do it.",
4OaKpz06L_KOXGhav1U7-w,This really good juicy hot chicken but I gotta say I prefer Prince's better. Prince's chicken is seasoned throughout. Hatties fries are amazing. They are cooked to perfection and the seasoning makes them over the top yummy.,,
4P4xAlez6AKhuK-S_RBcAA,Oh. My. Goodness. This was so delicious. I got the tenders (their most popular option) with 2 medium tenders and 1 hot tender and I wish I would've got more hot tenders cause the hot is spicy but still flavorful. The Mac and cheese was phenomenal! Don't wear black if you go for lunch cause the line is long and it's hot :),,

4PNQoNRVKWwiOPttks8GNQ,This was the best place I'd eaten during my quick trip to Nashville. The line was pretty much out the door when I arrived the line moved quickly. It was hard to decide what I wanted because everything on the menu sounded good. I went with the three whole wings (medium spice level but I could've gone hotter) with a side of pimento mac n cheese and southern greens. Oh and sweet tea to quench my thirst. I managed to find a seat in the packed restuarant and didn't have to wait long at all for the server to bring out my food. Everything was soo good! The chicken was juicy and crispy enough to my liking. Seasoning was great. The mac and cheese was awesome and so were the greens. All I needed was a little hot sauce for the greens bc that's just how I roll but I was fine without it. I would definitely go to Hattie B's again when I visit TN or GA!,,
4PWXEfAygNlR5aKqgJQurw,,"Went on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and some of his friends, and waited for about 40 minutes...there are a couple bars close by, so just grabbed a couple drinks and waited in line.

Ordered the charbroiled oysters and they were great, loved the touch of cheese.
However the Chicken & Andoullie gumbo I ordered was not good. Was tasteless when I put it in my mouth but left a burning feeling in my throat after swallowing...

Service was rushed, and the waitress left our cups unfilled even after walking past the table several times.
And the table where we sat had a lot of foot traffic coming through and I kept getting hit in the head with people arms, purses, strollers, etc... 

Overall- Good Oysters, but probably won't be back. I'm not usually such a party poooper but it just wasn't my night.",
4PlHcbiBqRWog14XgusqVg,"Wow, so many different options.  I got the southern AKA NO HEAT. Wasn't expecting the leg and thigh plate to be one big piece of chicken but was still good.

My significant other got the 3 tenders and they let you get different heat levels if you ask.  He got medium, hot, and damn hot. He started with the damn hot and He really liked it.  With Cheyenne and ghost peppers I think they said. He was sweatin' a little. Thank goodness he didn't do all 3 pieces for hot stuff. 

Mac n cheese and baked beans were very tummy!! 

We got there like 5-515 had to wait about 10 minutes before ordering. Food came out within 10 minutes. When we left there was a line around the building.",,

4Q6NJ2xJPE7EvTz0CIcnGg,,"The grilled oysters!! I don't like oysters.. at all whether they are raw or grilled but these were the first I've liked! The bread it comes with is so delicious when dipped in the garlicky sauce as well. 

We also liked the fried shrimp. It came out piping hot! Their gumbo wasn't that good and the wait was super long but I'd say it's still worth the wait!",
4QcoLV2vq3KBOt22sVP8gw,,"This place is so overrated. Every time I go I get more and more aggravated. Mostly because I know I am not going to like it and instead of changing my mind it is just reinforced by tasteless food and at least screw up on my order. It may not always be big, but its enough. I refuse to go back and when I am asked where it is, along with my directions I recommend Felix's across the street. Unless you just want to be able to say you went to Acme, I would go elsewhere.",
4Qijwb2RDiUGc4SBjA2lJg,,,"This is a very big and welcoming restaurant right off of Bourbon Street in the French Quarter.  I was leery of it because of its proximity to Bourbon... but I don't consider to be a tourist trap... and that's because the prices are very reasonable for the food that you get.  They are known for having the best crab cakes in town... but I found them to be just average.  My girlfriend liked them more than I did.  The fried shrimp, however, were better than your average fried shrimp.  I don't know what it was that was different about the breading, but it was almost cornmeal-like... and it was just very tasty.  The desserts were also good - I had the pecan pie and my girlfriend loved her Bananas Foster Ice Cream cake.  I hate banana, but my girlfriend said it was very unique and really delicious.  The service was extremely fast (especially for NOLA) and very friendly.  This place is also on restaurant.com if you're looking to save some dough on seafood while in New Orleans."
4QnOHtPIYn1ycvt3F5d7Tw,"Literally everyone says you have to have hot chicken when you come to Nashville. My Lyft driver recommended Hattie B's, since I had limited transport. So, on a Friday night, I stood in a long line for this hot chicken. 

After about 20-30 minutes, I placed an order for a medium hot chicken sandwich along with a side of Mac and cheese, and a peach cobbler for dessert. You get to choose the spicy level from no heat to shut the cluck up, which has a burn notice. I was advised that the medium level was actually pretty spicy already. I was given a table tag and found a place to sit. Food was brought out to me within 15 minutes. 

The food was pretty good! The medium level was pretty spicy without losing its flavor. Mac and cheese was bomb. The peach cobbler is an absolute must. Do stop by if you're close by!",,"I and my friends decided that since we were in NOLA, it would make sense to try a po' boy while we were here, since we had never tried one before. A quick search on Yelp showed us that Oceana Grill was the closest place to us for lunch, so we ventured over. We were seated within 10 minutes of arrival. Our server was very kind and attentive, and took care to go over what would be good to try in addition to the po'boys. He actually suggested the alligator bites, so one  of my friends and I decided to be adventurous and give it shot.

Best. Decision. Ever. It was bursting with flavor. It was maybe a little tougher to chew than regular sausage, but the texture did not detract from the flavor at all. Do yourself a favor and try these if you're up for it!

I opted for the fried shrimp po' boy, and it did not disappoint either. They also came with a side of fries. I appreciated that the portion size were generous, so I could have the rest for dinner later! Overall, I was happy that we made the stop here!"
4QoQ9VUn9qOtCpCE1D85dw,"The wait itself was about an hour and a half tops and the line seemed to moved at a steady pace making it not seem as bad. Once inside we ordered and found seats. One bonus about this place is that despite how crowded it is outside, there are actually a decent amount of open seats on the heated, covered patio.
Today I had the honor of trying both their white/dark meat chicken and chicken tenders. The only unfortunate thing about my review is that I only ordered medium and mild, only because it's early in the trip and I want to be able to enjoy the rest of it pain free and away from the think tank. 
I'll start with the medium spicy chicken tenders which I ordered with crinkle cut fries (Yum! Drooling emoji) and Pimento Mac n Cheese. The crinkle cut fries were fried golden, nice and crisp. They were seasoned well with Cajun seasoning and the potatoes on the inside were nice n fluffy just like my tummy. The Mac n cheese was amazing, and that's coming from someone who doesn't like cheese that much! Mild in cheese flavor, yet creamy with an added pepper taste from the pimento. Now, the chicken tenders! Mild in spice but damn, had a pretty strong kick still. The spice was so flavorful, something I've never tasted on a chicken tender before. Being a dry rub, the spice gives the chicken this distinct flavor that packs some serious heat. The breading was nice and crispy, and chicken itself was very juicy. Has to be one of, if not, the juiciest and plump chicken tenders I've ever had. 
Next up, the 1/2 chicken that includes a breast, thigh, leg, and drumstick for a nice mix of dark and white meat. For the half chicken, I ordered with fries and the red skin potato salad. The red skin potato salad was very good, but nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion. Both orders also come with a couple pickle chips that are very delicious. If you're a pickle lover, you'll definitely appreciate them.
On to the fried chicken, the headliner, the great bambino, the holy grail. The fried chicken (mild) has great flavor and was fried to perfection. Nice and crisp on the outside with the perfect amount of breading and extra juicy on the inside. I'm not kidding when I say juicy, we're talking ripe watermelon in the middle of summer that's been baking in it's own sweet juices for weeks. How do they do it!? The chicken breast, which is generally dry in my experience, was so moist and juicy so you can imagine how juicy the dark meat pieces were. I will say, the mild was not spicy at all which is good but it didn't have as much of that delicious spice flavor as the medium spice flavor, which makes sense. 
Overall, I'd give Hattie Bs a solid 4.8 out of 5.  I have to deduct .02 from my rating due to the wait time. I will say I'm glad I waited it out for the experience but it's really hard to justify a long wait for any food. I will say the chicken itself was a 5/5, hands down. If you enjoyed this review, please remember to give me a thumbs up! Until next time, stay hungry my friends.",,
4QqIas6hbSSlghs7lK6g_w,,Excellent service but overhyped. Luckily line wasn't too long on a Friday night.  Chargrilled oysters didn't have enough butter mixture to dip my bread!,
4R2Q6JVN3vytZC3EaTC85A,,"45 Minute wait wasn't worth my time.  Everything was deep fried - fishy tasting and they DON""T de-vein their shrimp - when i mentioned it to the waitor he said ""who care's it's protein"".  Enough said....

4RIusJ7k1gvh1phWHRgVKw,,,"We went to Oceana based on some comments we read when searching for good restaurants in the FQ.  The hostess was very nice.  Our server was very nice too but seemed a little spread thin at times.  My husband ordered  red beans and rice with sausage...the taste was good but there were only two small pieces of sausage in the bowl.  Also, the beans were way over cooked and mushy (more like a bowl of liquid refried beans).  I ordered the crab cakes and was very disappointed.  It was more like a croquet...the crab was completely shredded and there were no chunks of crab meat at all.  They were a little too fishy tasting for me as well.  The creamy mushroom and crawfish sauce on top was good and I would have enjoyed that over rice MUCH MUCH MORE than the two fishy crab 'croquets' that I didn't eat.  We ended our meal with some creme brûlée which was pretty good.   I am sad to say I will probably never go back as the meal wasn't that good, the meat was scarce, and consequently the value lacking.  But the staff was great if that's what you want!"
4RTWYboNDnQWibOhPhwsUg,Waited about 45 mins on a Sunday afternoon but well worth the wait!  The hot fried chicken was absolutely delicious and Inwould recommend to anyone that likes hot food.

As a local who has recommended this place to others, I was so frustrated by this experience. That banana pudding is always a crowd pleaser.",,

We had some appetizers like charred oysters, gator bites and Cajun fries! Unfortunately I didn't get good pics due to it being a vendor taking us out!  However, the Cajun fries were outstanding, the gator bites kicked butt and the charred oysters were good not the best I've had!  

They have Daly specials and tonight Wes a huge Redfish blackened with a cornbread jalopeno concoction that was a perfect blend with the Redfish and shrimp!  It came with a side of greens in a mustard sauce that added the range to mix with the sweetness of the cornbread thingy!  Huge portion and absolutely delicious!  

I'd definitely comeback for more based on service and quality of food!  Good prices!

4U5Mp6dO90DOd10QkOb1Gw,,"Went on a Friday night and waited in the line outside for 45 minutes for a party of 8.  Casual atmosphere with excellent service.  We had the catfish platter (my favorite out all the restaurants where we tried catfish), the batter had a little kick to it and the filet itself was thick and juicy. We also had the New Orleans Medley (jambalaya, gumbo, red beans and rice).  The gumbo, red beans and rice and the jambalaya were great.  Other entrees tried were softshell crab po-boy. The softshell crab and fries were fried to perfection. We loved everything... but the only disappointment of the meal was the size of the oysters on that day.  Don't get me wrong, the flavor and everything about the chargrilled and raw oysters were yummy.  Just wished they were a little bit bigger.  All in all, 9/10 for a great start to NOLA.",
4U62PId4nKLnmf5YnbtosA,,,NASTY!!! Just watch S03E14 of Kitchen Nightmares. It's available on Sony Crackle.... Ate at this restaurant prior to being notified by a local to avoid this restaurant. Apparently it's only popular with naive tourists. Had the shrimp platter. The shrimp had a mild fish oder that was not pleasant. Did not finish. Dining partner had the Oyster Po-Boy. She was gagging because it's taste was so awful. We left immediately. AVOID THIS PLACE! It's obvious they don't have quality control standards.

The peas where cold and compared to traditional southern methods. The cold slaw was just milky with no taste or character. The mac n cheese was runny. So being raised in the south Mississippi I rate Hattie B's a B-",,

Good parking, super staff and excellent food. I will gladly return on my next trip to Nashville.",,
4ULUWqda23gUl_VylJ2OAw,,"Super overrated.  There were a lot of things that left me unsatisfied - mainly the taste of the food.  Things were either too salty or bland.  Adding Tabasco sauce improved the taste immensely, but what a shame to have to add Tabasco sauce to everything.

Raw oysters tasted bland.  Gumbo tasted like salt.  I heard the fried oysters tasted funny alone but tasted okay in the po-boy with bread and lettuce. Hush puppies were good, but I would not recommend standing in line for 30-40 minutes for them.  I'm not sure I could recommend standing in line for 30-40 minutes for anything at Acme.

Service was okay but Acme is crowded so our server was quite busy that night.  It did take some effort to get a hold of her and she forgot to bring out a beer so she comp'd it for us.  

There are oyster/seafood places all around New Orleans.  I don't think that Acme lives up to its hype.",

This place is crazy busy all the time so expect to wait. We finally found a day when the line wasn't super crazy and decided to try it. We tried the southern style which has no heat, the mild and the medium levels. We heard that you should go down a level of heat to what your use to eating. I highly recommend doing that. The medium definitely had some kick to it. Perfect for me. Talked with someone who had the hot and hot it was indeed.  They do have a level called "" shut the cluck up"" which uses ghost peppers that's for the really daring people. Good luck if you try it. 
Overall I would recommend going for the chicken and the experience but skip the coleslaw it's just terrible. No flavor.",,

I hurriedly walked w/ my to-go order to my rental car parked in a nearby lot. Once inside the car, I discovered what all the hype was about. The chicken was AMAZING.

I picked the tenders plate - hot style- with pimento mac and cheese and baked beans. The heat level of the hot style was perfect and had great flavor. The pimento mac and cheese is a brilliantly Southern combination of flavors. The baked beans have a nice maple flavor to them; it really balanced out the meal.

I ate the hot chicken and boy it was HOT! My nose was full on running and my eyes began to tear. My husband ordered the clucking hot and said it was the hottest and best chicken you have ever had. Mind you, my husband eats jalenpenos with every meal and thinks Siracha is like ketchup. He is a real ""spicy"" food snob. He is hardly ever satisfied with any restaurants level of spicy. This chicken did the trick for him. The sides were all pretty tasty however he was not a fan of the collard greens. The service was quick and friendly and we would definitely go back again!",,
4WtZuYo9Qms2LJ74w1qnFw,,,Everything here is finger licking good. I've worked across the street from Oceana Grill for years. The barbecue ribs are to die for! Trust me you won't be disappointed.
4X-1cZJ3V3KQLbijv5IwWA,,"On our trip to New Orleans I really wanted to try every kind of food the Big Easy has to offer.  I'm not a fan of Oysters, so when this was recommended, I was apprehensive.  When you walk up to Acme Oyster House, you think you're going to a ride on Disney World as there is a huge line outside.  We were very fortunate that our wait was about 25 minutes and that we were seated at the Oyster Bar. The place was very crowded and lively and everyone from the guests to the bartenders was very friendly.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink since it was very early in the day, but the bartender prepared a his specialty for me... I still don't know what it was, all I know is that it had plenty of vodka.. No judging, I was on vacation!  The gentleman sitting next to us noticed we were a bit lost when it came to ordering oysters and suggested we get them Chargrilled.  We still felt unsure so we only ordered the ""half platter.""  As we waited we got to see how the Oysters are shucked.  The staff behind the bar was so attentive, it made the wait seem like only 5 minutes.  The Oysters arrived and WOW!!! They blew me away! They were absolutely delicious!! We even ordered a second platter.  I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting New Orleans.  I even got to go behind the bar and shuck an oyster myself!! Amazing!! Thanks Acme Oyster House!!",
4X78aKKjyvCb5CguFyF0vA,,,"Christmas day, they were organized, friendly, and quick with service. Unfortunately, the food was not good. I was disappointed. I could not finish my meal. Possibly the standard for mass production on Christmas, and in French quarter. Who knows? Red beans had too much liquid smoke. The blackened chicken was flat, dry and flavorless. Hurricane was good. Way overpriced for the quality of food."
4XIjdvV3bz-e_NYzJRJLHg,"Fried chicken at it's finest. There is a reason there is a line out the door. The ""hot"" sauce wasn't over powering so don't be afraid of it. All the sides were good. I ordered the two uppers. Two breast and wings. Way too much food, but how can you say no. You only live once!",,"Open late for a sit down place. Outdoor patio dining. However it's just another average touristy fried food type place. I ordered the ""famous"" crab cakes- with the sauce on the side. Ok. The Bloody Mary was terrible, served in a hurricane glass. We also ordered fried alligator to share, chewy but a decent spice profile."
4XJn_kgFEZsHDNem_P3r7A,,,"This is an ok find right off of Bourbon.  I've eaten here a number of times and never left very impressed.  I returned this last time because they have a lot of seating (at least 3 stories!) and can easily accomodate large groups.  We called about an hour ahead for about 30 people on a Wednesday night, and there were still open tables on the floor we were seated on.    

I must say the oysters on the half shell were great and shucked perfectly!  Too bad that doesn't count though since I can get those at about 1000 places in New Orleans.  The fried gator bites were pretty tasty, but the shrimp poboy was a let down.  The fried shrimp weren't that good, and the batter was not complementary at all.  It was too thick, and you couldn't even taste the shrimp.  I've tried other dishes there too, including their friend oysters, and none have left me with much to be excited about.  

The service was friendly but pretty slow.  Overall, it has a cool atmosphere, is easy to get to from Bourbon, and is good for large groups.  However, for anyone that knows good cajun seafood, there are a number of better options in the area."

4Xl0dzD4Xk-RTEW6DEBuCw,,Wow I am a believer! Oysters char grilles were the best in the world. I ordered half a dozen but had to other the other half as well,
4Xq6wZztTQGbO06EyrpCFQ,,,"Everything about the food and service was amazing! Kim was such a great server and everyone else seemed so genuine and nice and really took interest in us and greeted and checked on us. Great hospitality! 

Husband ordered the holly roller ipa and I'm not an IPA fan but it was really good. He also got the fettuccine Alfredo and he said it was the best. Chicken cooked perfectly and it had the perfect amount of spice. He ate it all. Clean plate club, yup!! 

I ordered the Oceana oysters and OMG... amazing. I also got the gumbo soup which was good but the oysters were definitely the star. 

I definitely recommend dining here. We ate for lunch and got a lunch menu which had a lot of selection on it so I'm sure dinner is just as great! 

Thanks again Oceana team!"
4XyxVr0wTwtIw4mfgs-nMw,,,Authentic New Orleans experience. Drinks are terrific! I felt like I was in Nawlans coming here. Staff was kind and very accommodating!
4Y6srUlYP5pfeAY4Mvpb3w,,,"Excellent service, very attentive staff. If you want to eat here at night Thursday through Sunday, I definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time because the place gets pretty packed and the line to wait in gets really long. Went with a friend and we shared 2 appetizers: crab cake with crawfish sauce which was delicious and the fried eggplant fries which were also excellent and had a great dipping sauce. We then shared the fried shrimp platter. All the food was really good, and the portions are quite large (glad we shared the dinner course because the appetizers ended up filling us up quite a bit). This restaurant has excellent food, very reasonable prices (especially considering how much food you get), and a really fun atmosphere."

4Z1ho5D_JaxaMRyV09FvaQ,,,Great authentic fresh food. Good quality service. First time in NOLA and had a great food experience at Oceana.  It's a must try location.
4ZOPJppmsoaopx8DoIFF_Q,,,"First day in New Orleans and we were disappointed by the construction. Low and behold this little gem. Our waitress was amazing, the lost bread was to die for and the mimosas were top notch. Then I got dinner to go and it was just as good. Very friendly and pretty comparable price-wise."
4ZOW7XH087CpgtIK79ccDg,Chicken sandwich was amazing! Only suggestion is to be prepared for the wait and to bring some sunscreen because the lines are long and there isn't really any shade.,,
4ZTGndoo_E6yAVoFFbklug,,"Rarely  do I believe the hype and stand in line for an but I stand amazed at the Acme Oyster House.  I have only eaten oysters one time- and hey were raw and in San Francisco. Only cocktail sauce came with them and I was underwhelmed. But after hearing about the chargrilled ones here- I had to try.  So we were seated at a table with two other couples.  They had three dozen of them and offered us a taste. OMG- flavor bomb of garlic, butter, Parmesan and smoke. Tender and tasting of clean ocean, 12 were just not enough for he three of us. Still- we curbed our desire so we would have room for our main course. Must also mention that 5$ a glass Chardonnay was reasonable. 
     We got the shrimp platter and the fried shrimp was fresh, hot, crispy and delicious. Only downside was no sauce available other than ketchup. Ugh! I got the Boo fries which were a take on poutine and the gravy was out of this world. 
      Our final choice was the hamburger PoBoy medium rare plus cheese which was a good burger. 
      Our server was awesome and had waited 4 years to get hired there because no one ever leaves. You ABSOLUTELY have to try this place at least for the chargrilled oysters. I will for sure be back in my next trip to NOLA.",
4ZkQwaOoLT2eJWux9fE1Jw,,,There was a 15 minute wait . Waitress  was pleasant  . Ordered  their gumbo . Which had three shrimp  for a  small. cup . It had a lot of flavor but I would  have liked it hotter.  Tried their sampler plate of etouffee  creole  jambalaya  and red beans and rice  good choice . There was plenty  of food to share . Liked the red beans and the etouffee  . Jambalaya  was just ok. It is worth  a second chance prices were reasonable
4Zkv2tsS0hZbm5N-O_6k2w,"I do not understand the hype for this restaurant.  My husband really wanted to try it out as it was the ""go to"" chicken spot.  We stood in line for a total of 1 1/2 hours or more in the scorching heat. I had no water, and there was no where to hide from the heat. Luckily there was a cupcake restaurant next door where I purchased a bottle of water and stayed for  in the ac for a few minutes. I went back to the line as it moved up a centimeter (at least it felt like it). I don't know why my husband wanted to wait this long. Finally.. we arrive to the front of the restaurant where you place your order. I ordered mild chicken tenders with a side of waffles and my husband ordered a piece of chicken with mac and cheese, beans and a pitcher of beer.  We sat in their dining area outside while they brought out the food. We finally receive our food!!!!  Hallelujah we get to eat.  

The chicken tender was not bad tasting. Even though it was mild it still had some spice. The waffle however was so crispy it felt like I was eating a piece of overcooked toast.  I drenched it in maple syrup which still didn't help.  It fell apart immediately so I just ate the tenders. I took a bite of my husbands mac and cheese and I have had way better tasting mac at chain restaurants. We finished the pitcher of beer and went back to our hotel. I was so burned and exhausted from standing under the sun that we decided to nap.  Anyway, long story short, as soon as we woke up from a nap - we both were so sick from the food that we had to wait several hours to leave our room. We went out after 8 pm and had a horrible time as we were still somewhat sick.  

NEVER AGAIN.",,
4ZwETPc7PSZUA_3Qm4__gA,"I heard all of the hype about Hattie B's prior to my visit to Nashville so I wanted to see if it was legit.  It was all true.  I was there on an early Sun. afternoon and didn't have to wait much more than 10 min.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  You order at the counter and they deliver your food to you.  I got the chicken tenders plate mild.  Not being a ""spicy"" fan, the mild was just right with just a touch of heat.  This chicken was the most tender, and juiciest, fried chicken that I've ever had. The pimento mac 'n cheese, fries, baked beans, and bacon cheddar grits (Sunday only) were all good sides.  They also have a delicious house made lemonade that is very sweet.  They pump in classic old school music that just adds to the atmosphere.  I would certainly recommend Hattie's on your next visit.  Be prepared that you may have to wait in line for a while and there isn't a lot of parking at the Midtown location.",,
4_68fTw1PGVuvGWd9QS2OA,,The only place in the city I go to for charbroiled oysters. They're just Simply the best! The line seems long but it goes real fast and it is totally worth the wait even if it's raining. If you are in the French Quarter this is where you have to go.,
4_DiPDf0ixTEqz9E-aKYPQ,"As a local and a spicy food fanatic, Hattie's is no doubt a tourist hot spot- and not the hottest chicken in town, thus the 4 stars. BUT, it is tasty and has a great selection of sides. My personal go-to is the mac and cheese. 

Pro-tips: I love the new location on Charlotte, it is the same gig with much shorter lines. Also, if you're not feeling like a 45-min wait, order to-go online and pick up instead.. we like to take it down the street to Centennial park and have a picnic.",,

The food was served piping hot as exactly as ordered. My husband is a bit more of an adventurous eater and had a cajun omelette which he loved! The food was excellent and our server-Ponce- was magnificent! He was very attentive and pleasant. Our experience here was fantastic on all accounts- from the service to the food to the cleanliness of the restaurant. Try Oceana Grill- ask for Ponce. You won't be disappointed!"
4b0szi1NQ9eyFKlPFVL4vQ,,,"Everything was very good here. I had the gumbo, alligator bites, and the soft shell crab side. My favorite was the soft shell crab, it was amazing. I've never had alligator and have heard that it is tough, but here it was very tender and well seasoned. The gumbo was also good but not the best I've had. Overall the service, food, and atmosphere made for a very good meal."

4cyxnHzC_dl-5L4zE0tBhg,,,My thoughts of this place are blah.first time in New Orleans this place came recommend and was very underwhelming. Had the shrimp platter. (Blah) Cajun jambalaya pasta ( sauce blah felt like I woulda crapped my pants). Sent the pasta back and still got charged for it. So just a blah place
4dXZ-9CdrzSs6QKCsVsFtg,,"With all of the warnings about a wait, we decided to get there before opening around 10:45am on Monday.  To our surprise, we found they opened at 10:30am so we walked right in!  

I had eaten here before many years ago and remember thinking it was a perfect NOLA dive (in a good way). That hadn't changed (although the Wall of Fame was new and improved).   Those traditional red & white checked tablecloths, tight quarters, festive atmosphere, all perfect for some fast seafood.

Our waiter came to our table right away to take our order, but after that she was kind of hard to find.  I decided to try the chargrilled oysters and the oyster po-boy.  Was a little surprised that the chargrilled came out with the meal, but no worries.  They were piping hot and were really the star of the meal.   Not sure what all they were covered, thinking cheese, butter, garlic, etc.  But like everyone says, they are not to be missed.  The oyster po-boy though was underwhelming, oysters were small and I was not a huge fan of the breading.  I can think of several places back home that I think have better oyster po-boys.  

If I come back, I'll probably order a dozen chargrilled and call it a day!",
4dgcXadfX2wNAAvBEGpesQ,We stopped by right at opening on a Monday and there was about a 10 minute wait. You order when you walk in and then sit and wait for food. I think they try and only allow those in that can be seated but be prepared to share a table with new friends. The chicken is very delicious! I had the mild and I can't tolerate spice at all and it was just right. The pimento Mac and cheese was good but the baked beans had too much of a kick for me. Ordering online and then picking up is also an option if you'd rather not wait in the line.,,
4dlOYCy0KMcM6MkFVnV0Pg,"I had the Damn Hot spice level chicken. It was freshly cooked and was pretty high on the heat level. It was overall very good. I had the mac n cheese for a side. I would recommend this place for a good meal. Beware, the line can be long.",,
4dyhAoix3TYxKoI2hDcguw,,Super slow service.  Waitress wasn't attentive to our group.  Had to ask for a refill several times.  She never came back after food was placed on table to check on us.  We had a group of 7 people so she knew the automatic 18% gratuity was included no matter what her service was like,
4e9-roUfqfa7fp3zdMKDvw,"Hattie B's is legit! There is a good reason why I waited in line for over an hour to eat here. Their Hot Chicken is some of the best, if not the best, fried chicken I have ever had. The meat was perfectly juicy and tender and the skin was addictively crispy and topped with flavorful and hot spice.  Tart pickle slices that topped the chicken complimented the heat perfectly. The sides and desserts were also delicious! The Pimento Mac & Cheese was rich and cheesy, the Red Skin Potato Salad was savory and creamy, the Southern Greens flavorful, and the Banana Pudding was sweet, creamy, and rich. The restaurant also has some local craft beer options which pair nicely with the chicken. Hattie B's is a must visit when in Nashville.","The Chargrilled Oysters at Acme Oyster House were recommended multiple times by friends and locals so a visit was warranted. My fiancé and I waited about 30 minutes to be seated on a Saturday night. We ordered half a dozen of the highly recommended Chargrilled Oysters, half a dozen Raw Oysters, and the Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy. The Raw Oysters were fresh and delicious. The Chargrilled Oysters were unique and had a nice smoky flavor but I preferred the Raw Oysters. The Po-Boy was bland. Not sure who voted the sandwich #4 in Top Ten Sandwiches as claimed by the menu but they must have had terrible competition. Overall, I enjoyed my visit but it's pretty obvious to stick to the oysters.",

We had Raw Oysters (which were great), Blackened Alligator (better than fried and it was delish), Red Fish with Crawfish Sauce, and the Praline Duck. Everything was great and affordable.

You're looking this place up because you like oysters, so why mess around.

Try to get there by 10:30 am, or you risk a wait, a wait that is worth it, but know that I will never wait, as I will be there at 10:30am.
It's a real treat to find out that it lived up to the hype, and Im glad I was able to make the trip here.

I've been here twice and not had anything else except the char-oysters, oyster shooter, so I can not comment on the rest of menu, but everything look pretty amazing.  Thus far the people in New Orleans are the friendliest people I've had the pleasure to dine with. 

I don't rate a place if I don't like a place.",

My sister had the seafood omelette.  She didn't leave anything leftover either. My other sister had the St. James Crepe. It was HUGE and delish also. Coffee was great too. Food was pricey but thats nothing new for the french quarter. Definitely recommend this place. Jerleen, our waitress, was friendly and gave us great service."

We were also guided there by the concierge at Prince Conti."

4fzuUiXPFgV6HxiEVWMkEA,,,This is definitely a tourist spot and not representative of New Orleans cuisine. In fact I would classify the food as extremely average. The service was great though.
4g4wQdADOlmXJ5blEYJc5A,,"Not only were the guys behind the bar hilariously entertaining while the opened what seemed like 100 oysters every 2 minutes, but the chargrilled oysters were the most amazing thing we had in New Orleans.  That meal, even though I cringed at $21 for 12 oysters was more than worth that price.  If you are a cheapskate like me, always looking for the best value, shut the *uck up and dive in - these couldn't be worth more even if they were hand dipped in gold!!!
The craw puppies were alright... maybe not worth getting, especially when you could just order two full platters of chargrilled oysters.
Oh yeah, I should mention there is a line.... usually an ungodly line for this place.  I'm a cheapskate with ADHD, so me getting into this place was only because my wife was next to me wanting to try it.  Worth it, worth waiting an hour even. (We waited 30 minutes)
If I haven't mentioned it enough, the chargrilled oysters, for the live of whatever you love the most in your life - get them!!!!",

4gHlpNLLJC9_sBN6H2OaSw,,"Sorry to break it to you. This is probably one of the small number of tourist traps we ran into a NOLA.

Came here on a Monday afternoon and didn't have to wait at all. Got a dozen of the chargrilled oysters, two oyster shooters and shared a soft shell crab poboy. 

The char grilled oysters were.. overly salty with the cheese, and slightly tough. Super greasy due to the cheese. And not worth the $.  (no happy hour here either).

The oyster shooters were good but not impressive.. you basically pay $3 for a shot of vodka+oyster+cocktail sauce. Good deal but not exactly good tasting.

The soft shell crab was fried lightly, but super bland. nothing memorable, except for the price.

Overall, I would say this is one place you can skip in NOLA.",

I had a cup of Gumbo, Cajun Style Jambalaya, which came with a side of sausage & collard greens.  All tasted the best I've ever had.  And we did try different restaurants in the French Quarter throughout the week.  Wife also had the Gumbo with a side of Hush Puppies, which she loved.  It was a cold day so I had a Bailey's Irish Crème & Coffee, which was mixed perfect.  This restaurant was recommended by a local.  A must visit for great tasting food.  They also deliver."

We all ordered chicken tenders, Mac and cheese, fries and coleslaw. My son and husband loved everything.  We had not eaten all day and were famished, so food usually tasted better when your starving.  All in all I thought it was good but not worth the long waits.  The coleslaw was very average.

Plenty of seating in and out.  Parking a bit hard to find, we parked 5 blocks away.  They do sell nice cold beer - always nice and should be served while waiting in line:)

Sweet tea was very mild, needed to be sweeter.

There is an alternate location and I heard they have shorter lines.",,
4hHYPxgFqQ1y1K-HvbP6Hw,,,"Ate here a couple days ago while visiting New Orleans. We got a 10% off coupon from our hotel. It was our first taste of Cajun food down here and was definitely worth checking out. Being unsure what to get exactly, we got the Po-Boys, one with half shrimp, half catfish.. the other with half fried, half blackened gator. It was a lot of food, very filing, and delicious (the shrimp I believe was the best). Also ordered a Swamp Tea, it was decent although a quite a bit sweeter than I had expected.

The restaurant itself was very cool, had a courtyard, seating right by the windows, and a bar. The prices were fair as well, about average for what you'd see anywhere else in the French Quarter.. roughly in the $12-$15 range. Our server was Ponce, he was great, helped when deciding what to order and was very prompt, attentive, and friendly. Would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone as a first stop in the city."

Had the chicken tenders in mild but wished I had upgraded to the hot. We were forewarned that their hot chicken was HOT but that must have been from someone who doesn't love hot food. The hot was just the right amount of spice and after burn that totally complimented the juicy chicken. Not sure I would go for the ""shut the cluck up"" heat level but it's there if you have the mouth and stomach for it. Wished I saved room for the banana pudding which was supposed to be out of this world. 

Buy a pitcher of beer, go for the hot tenders (all the sides are great but the beans and coleslaw were my personal favorites) and grab a table on the porch. It's nothing fancy but you will have a great meal.",,

4hzNX1bsqzdKgHl73JJk5g,,,Appetizers...crabcakes good but bbq shrimp was buttery bbqy goodness. I could have drunk the sauce! The highlight was the jambalaya pasta. So much creamy  sauce balanced with the pasta shrimp and chicken. So flavorful! Fast service and fun staff.
4iIElIaNJUdNxnRlK89wIg,,"I like Acme, they have a good selection of creole foods, drinks, cocktails, and more. They have good value for their food, conveniently located and from my passed experiences the food has always been fresh. I wouldn't say the best seafood house in NOLA, but the value is why I must give this place 4 stars. They also have multiply locations which makes it convenient to go to no matter where you are in the city.",
4iKv1gQVSjQWJ1AyseysZw,"When first waiting in line over 30 min, I wanted nothing more than the hot chicken to be amazing. And I'm so glad my friends and I waited it out! My friend and I split an order the tenders with the heat level of hot with sides of fries and mac and cheese. The chicken was AMAZING. Definitely hot, which I love, but may be slightly overwhelming to others who do not like that level of spice. (My friends got the medium and thought that was almost too spicy). The chicken was cooked perfectly and the hot spice was cooked in the actual breading of the chicken. I'm still having dreams of this delicious meal. The only downsize is the line, but if you're with a group of friends, bring some water and enjoy each other's company. It's worth it.",,
4ict80YlN3FLTgPjkkVAxA,,"Nice crowd, long line and fast service. But then again every corner you go to in New Orleans offers pretty much the same quality food, some are better for cheaper price.

The waiter was friendly and did her best with the number of table she had to care for.

The chargrilled oysters are a must, I loved them.  Also get the crawfish tails, it's battered and deep fried.",
4jUpP4fBbTtN3XXTYGfQhA,,"This was one of the locations I went to eat during my stay in New Orleans.  This restaurant came recommended as being a popular spot to visit.  There was a bit of a wait outside the restaurant as we arrived during their busiest hour of the day.  However, the food was well worth it.

We ordered the fried crawfish as well as the oysters.  Both selections were amazing.  I ordered the fish Po-Boy along with the potato salad for the main dish.  The food was great and left me satisfied.  I ordered the famous hurricane and was very pleased.

I would def visit again if I go to New Orleans in the future.  The service was good and the prices were reasonable.",

My waiter was great but some of the staff definitely were not in a good mood. They sat us right next to where they dump the plates and all the workers would come and just throw dirty plates and walk away. I ordered the tour of New orleans which came with Jambalaya, Gumbo, sausage and rice and beans. The Gumbo was average. The Jambayla was amazing though. Its a bit pricey for the small portion you get. If I would come back, it would be for the Oysters or Jambalaya,  that's about it",
4l64Qzxn0jjXyt532LGddw,,,I love Oceana! I make it a point to eat here every time I have company from out of town visiting so they can try great New Orleans food.
4lW1cdTKJicVqiSSXfRPFw,,"Don't let the long line dissuade you from eating here; it's well worth the wait! I tried the chargrilled oysters, and they were amazing. My only regret is not ordering more of them. The fried crawfish tails and fried crab claws were also delicious, but maybe could have used a little less breading so you could taste the seafood better. Not that I'm complaining. The breading they were coated in was pure fried goodness. The pecan cobbler brought the meal to a delightful end. 

The staff here are super friendly, and the service is quick once you've been seated. The noise level is pretty loud, but it works well with the whole feel of the place. I'd definitely recommend getting dinner here.",
4l_FsB6G2Icj944L5K7NRw,,"Just off Bourbon street, a great place to get started. Atmosphere is great with very good staff, bartender has a great personality. Food is great from po-boy to the oysters. Fast service too.",
4lgeKcQCe3b9Z4hvSlruHQ,,"Food (5/5): BEST OYSTERS I'VE EVER HAD!! Chargrilled Oysters are so delicious. Even if you don't really like oysters, TRY THESE OYSTERS. It's much different in taste and texture. Instead of having a sea-like taste, you have the smokiness from the grill. One of the people who shuck the oyster's recommended to put the chipotle hot sauce on there for added smoky flavor. The Crab Cake with Corn Maque Choux was amazing too, I highly recommend if you're not an oyster fiend and not willing to try the Chargrilled Oysters. It doesn't taste too much like the ocean and the play on flavors is so good. Boom Boom shrimp is bomb AF  too. So crunchy and packed with unique flavors. I wasn't a huge fan of the Jambalaya honestly, it wasn't impressive and I've had better. 

Price (5/5): So worth it in quality and quantity. Crab Cake with Corn Maque Choux: $11.49, Boom Boom Shrimp $10.99, Jambalaya $11.99

Ambiance (5/5): Reminds me of a retro diner with their neon lights and black and white tile. This place is a must-go when visiting New Orleans but be mindful of the time you're trying to go because there's usually a line out the door. Don't go in a group if you can. 

Service (5/5): The people who work here are knowledgeable about the menu, and a lot of them eat there to give you the right suggestions!",
4lmBznh9y4hCpNEROlOYaA,"Don't miss this spot
 Expect to wait about an hour outside before u can order. Great food.",,
4lnvgZm-lXa3iUsNokOpvQ,"I guess a must try if you visit Nashville! We got there and the line was huge! So I would recommend you to come when you're not ravenous cause you will be waiting for a while. As we waited they do offer beers so you can sip on something to pass the time. 
We had waited for about 2 hours when we finally got smart enough to order online. We placed our order while waiting and within 15-20 minutes our order was ready.  We picked up our food and ate at the Parthadon, not a bad idea on a gorgeous day. I would highly recommend doing take out!

We got the small dark plate and the sandwich. For the small dark plate we got mild for spicy which wasn't too bad. I thought it was pretty comparable to Popeyes Cajun chicken for spice level. The chicken is absolutely moist and the skin is crispy! We got the pimento Mac and cheese which was pretty good. The flavoring of the pimento isn't super strong so for those who don't normally like the pungent of pimento this wouldn't be a bad option. We got the potato salad which was pretty decent. We got the ""Nashville..."" sauce which tasted similar to chic fil a's sauce with a kick. Pretty good. I think the best part other than the chicken itself was the sliced bread the chicken was sitting on. The bread soaks up all the goodness so it was quite tasty!

The sandwich was pretty good. We got this at the medium spice level. Definitely has a bit of a kick but it balanced quite nicely with the other components of the sandwich. Would recommend getting the medium spice if you want to taste that 'spiciness'. We got greens as a side, it was okay. Needed some hot sauce but that's just how I grew up eating them.",,
4lsRpgGqrJAQGcrRYdz6YA,,,Absolutely love to visit this place every time I visit New Orleans. The Lost Bread is the best along with the Royal Omelet. Whitney provided such great service for our party and was very helpful with recommendations for my friends. I will definitely come back again and again.
4ltPFzBkTI1p7Q4dyYBa4Q,,,"Service was fast but they raved about their ""famous"" Crab Cakes and they wasn't as good as I thought they would be. The mushroom cream sauce yuck I wish they gave a option to put it on the side it was a little on the spicy side so o didn't like it that much. I also had the seafood gumbo which was a little bland as far as the taste is concerned I also would have like to see wings added to their menu I know it's an oyster house but sometimes I like wings with my seafood !"
4ltVfCpHhm95YgrvvEBbXQ,"I had the small dark quarter chicken with medium spice. I have a decent space tolerance, and I found that medium to be pretty hot! It was still really good though. The pimento macaroni and cheese was OK. I had a banana putting for dessert and that was pretty good.",,
4luJgvJ_NIniGnDTcFseJw,,Charbroiled Oysters were AMAZING ... Even if you don't like oysters these will leave you craving them ... I also had the Most popular po boy and definitely hit the spot a must have when coming to ACME but I stop raving about the Charbroiled Oysters my absolute Favorite,Delicious Seafood ... I wanted to heck this place out based on the reviews I read and they are all RIGHT!! The crab cakes app was so tasty BEST crab cakes I've had .. The oysters we very fresh and went down smoothly and the seafood gombo was very tasty ... They staff was very helpful and kind ... Will come back whenever I come visit
4m66tpqKs8JmoA26vB5xpQ,"This venue was our first and last eatery in Nashville.  I came with a small group and I don't know who's idea it was to try it out, but I am sure glad we all agreed.

Levels of heat from nothing to burning
Southern
Mild
Medium
Hot
Damned Hot
Shut the cluck up

Despite the warning, one person (Jon H) ordered ""shut the cluck up"" The rest of us ordered ""damned hot"".

The chicken was very good.  Shut the cluck up was intolerable for everyone.  Seriously, it hurt just trying the little portion he cut for me.  I am awed that Jon H (i would check out his review if you want to know more about STCU) FINISHED ALL of his chicken.

I tried the medium on my return trip, and it was not even spicy for me.  So i asked for the ""hot"" sauce which is really just oil, and poured it over my chicken.  I found it to be more to my liking but i still think ""damn hot"" is what I would order again.

The pimento mac and cheese was creamy and very good.  I did not like the greens.   The banana pudding was excellent as well. 

I have one bit of advice to share.  If you ordered varying levels of hotness, make sure to eat from the least hot first.  The oils from the most hot one will stay on you for a minute or more, and make everything seem hot.  Also starting low and working up will make you prepare for the worst one.",,
4m70vxi99c44uZT5dI0OOQ,,,"We stopped here to have dinner after pur ghost tour. It's right off Bourbon St. So, we even enjoyed the walk on Bourbon street afterward. It was recommended to me by a friend.

The food was quite delicious. We had 1/2 dozen oysters, blackened chicken, and blackened bayou duck. The oysters were fresh and yummy. My boyfriend said his chicken was delicious!! And my duck was fantastic. It's a different style of cooking duck than I'm used to, but the duck was tender and full of flavor for the blackened spices.  Finished off with the chocolate Kalua mouse cake. It was good, but not much Kahlua flavor detected.  Also, my boyfriend got a double shot gin &tonic, and let me tell you, they are NOT short changing you. It was definitely a double! Yummy!

Most notably, I have to give kudos for their service. Not that we experienced any bad service here in NOLA, but the staff was just on top of it and so friendly. We were seated so quickly. Our server, Jordan P, took such good care of us. She was so friendly and made great food recommendations!  The manager, hostess, etc- everyone welcomed us and made sure we were having a good time, without being disruptive.   

We definitely recommend stopping in here!!"
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,,,"I ate here this past Sunday night with a dining companion.  The restaurant itself is not too much, at least the side that we were put into with a liquor bar in the front and an oyster bar in the back.

My dining companion and I decided to split two appetizers, the Gator Tail Bites and a dozen Oysters on the Half Shell along with a Shrimp Po Boy between the two of us for a nice snack.  The gator bites and oysters came out at the same time and both looked fantastic.  The oysters were meaty and served over ice with crackers while the gator tails were blackened with remoulade.  Both appetizers tasted wonderful with the gator tails having a good flavor and spice that married wonderfully with the remoulade and the oysters were fresh and tasty.  Shortly after we finished the appetizers our Po Boy came out with cole slaw, pickles and a remoulade on it.  It did not disappoint either and had lots of great flavors.

The bottom line for me is that I was very satisfied with my meal at Oceana and I am glad that I ate there.  Both the food and the service was great and it is also worth noting that they server their dinner menu until 1 AM if you need a late night snack!"
4m9s0rFjiWwXp5J0EKpseQ,,"This was the first place we stopped when we arrived and let me tell you.........my oysters everywhere else did not stand a chance. Get here early or be prepared to stand in line. Had the chargrilled oysters, crawfish and poboy. The Hurricane was good. Second visit before we left the oysters were just ok but better from the rest. I went to see who was on the grill and wasnt same person as first time. Older woman at bar.....had to lookup ingredients to a drink that was on their drink menu....
Sign the chargrilled oysters are going to be good are if they are steaming when they hit the table and keep cooking until the topping on top crusts over. Also tried these at Oceana, Felix (across the street), and Crazy Lobster, ACME has the best. Will be hard for me to eat these anywhere else. Acme has set the standard for me.",
4mC_WOVDYHmBqwPrwbgjcA,,,Be prepared for a long wait in line to get in and once you're seated...be prepared to wait a great deal longer. Our server took our soup order and returned thirty minutes later. He never checked on us and once another thirty minutes passed and we were finally served our entrees he didn't return again until it was time for the check. He just didn't give a damn. I imagine a full restaurant with tourists ready to buy anything that's fished out will do that. I'll never eat here again.

Am not going to bother posting a picture of the chicken because many have but none of them do it justice. I had the hot chicken, my wife had the medium. Mine wasn't too bad which of course means I'll go for the ""Damn Hot"" next time in Nashville and regret it. I had the Large White and it was well named, a lot of chicken, beautifully cooked, tender inside despite the volume of the meat and the skin was perfectly crispy. Decent beer selection. Bought some swag, the hats are expensive. Will definitely return.",,
4mnF6uaH3Idc-_uxBck0pw,,,"This place is overrated. Our server was very nice and wanted to help us out. I wanted to try something new. So I tried the alligator po-boy. Wish I never did. Since it was the first time I had alligator it took me a while to realize that i was eating tainted meat - part of the meat was past it's last date of consumption. Yuck. 
The reason for three stars is that the place has a nice atmosphere and the rest was ok."

Great atmosphere, great food. We had oysters...oh so many wonderful, cold, big, fat, delicious oysters. Rice and beans, shrimp po' boys and you must try the boo fries. OH MY GRAVY!

Try to go on off hours, it's a shorter wait. If you go later in the evening, especially right at dinner time - expect to wait outside. If you find yourself waiting and thinking it can't be worth the wait...you're wrong.

Enjoy!",

Eats: 
Raw oysters: not the best I had but it was a good deal and pretty good
charred oysters: of course have to try it. I found it a bit salty for me. It is good but can't say I was in awe but worthwhile to try.
Fried softshell crab: actually not a lot of crab taste to it but worth trying.

I am glad I tried this place and overall happy with meal. Considering how touristy this place is it is actually very well priced. A good start to my New Orleans pigging out.",He as their redfish special which was redfish over a crawfish cornbread stuffing with a shrimp etouffe sauce over it. It was a pretty large portion. I really enjoyed the crawfish stuffing. The fish was a bit salty but that is southern food in general. All in all a good meal and service good. Water was constantly refilled.

We came in for lunch and we decided to sit in the courtyard, it was empty but that wasn't surprising due to the heat and humidity.   This didn't stop us though, the courtyard was pleasantly comfortable.   We were seated literally in front of a fountain and under an extra strong fan, which created a very cool atmosphere.   We were greeted by Jamal,  he was amazingly attentive but not overbearing.   The hostess brought us our drinks and in  less than a minute, there was Jamal.  He told us about the specials and gave us some time to decide.  
He came back and we ordered blackened alligator and another corona.    I've never tried alligator but when the runner brought it out, Jamal came around right after we tried the first bite; he was asking what we thought, if we needed anything else, etc...i digress, the food was VERY GOOD, seasoned nicely with a nice consistency. It has the same sort of texture as chicken (what doesn't though?). It was so good dipped in the sauce that is presented with it. This was a spicy blend of flavors - Cajun dipping sauce ?hhahaha 
I ordered the blackened Ahi tuna medium rare, stuffed with crawfish with a creamy sauce, creamed corn, red beans and rice and of course, jambalaya.   Holy cow!! It was delicious.  For dinner we finished with the creme brûlée- this was my favorite.  It was perfect.  

NOLA has been good to me... when in town check this place out and ask for Jamal.    The food is top
Notch and the service that Jamal provided will have us traveling 3000 Miles away again just for a visit!"

We arrived here about 5 minutes before they opened on a Saturday. I knew the line may be long but I didn't expect it to be so long! We were determined to try this place so we waited regardless. It was nice of them to have little water stations along the line. We waited nearly an hour until we got inside to order.  After ordering our food came out fairly quickly. I ordered a mild chicken (I'm lame when it comes to super spicy food haha), collards, and Mac and cheese. Let me just say.... that chicken is AMAZING! It truly lives up to the hype! It's a well seasoned combination of juicy and crispy. Both of my sides were also absolutely delicious. The portions are very large and filling. I tried my boyfriend's hot chicken.

We started off with the Oceana's Famous Oyesters. They were literally cooked to perfection. The cream sauce had hints of cheese & herbs through it, placing these in the top 5 oyesters I've ever had.

For dinner I did the blackened redfish étouffée. It was pretty darn good. The fish was a nice cut, wasn't overcooked or anything. The sauce was a creamy crawfish étouffée which is my only complaint was that there was only two little pieces of crawfish in the sauce & I definitely wanted more to partner up with my fish.

We could've went to Applebee's???
I think this is just a person who is working a side gig while they're in school or something??? 
I ordered the blackened catfish and about 2 mins after I asked Daniel if I could gt the fried catfish?
Daniel stated ""Thr already making it"" so it was a no go in NOLA...
The blackened catfish came with jambalaya rice and vegetables @ since I can't eat shellfish I asked my server if I can get something different and he said garlic mashed potatoes and that was it?...there were not many choices stated...
Anyways my food came out and the catfish was this little strip piece of fish??? Nothing special... also in the plate was this side dish that looked like some kind of cooked spinach along w/ jambalaya rice which I thought I told the waiter I couldn't eat shellfish? So being pretty annoyed I just told him that I didn't want it!! 
I ordered the chicken Alfredo instead and it was way better and I hate to say it but I didn't tip...I mean he didn't even do anything?? he didn't even bring the food out??someone else brought out the food..
So the one star is just for service and the restaurant itself was very nice....
Anyways I'm not gonna let this one negative situation at a restaurant bring my visit to NOLA-""New Orleans"" down and  tomorrow we're probably going to Acme restaurant to get some grub so I'll see how they do?
I've heard some good things about them.."
4t-L9KOUA9oqWxpbXNiVDQ,,,Bridget is awesome!!! She gave us great service. The charbroiled oysters and red beans and rice are awesome!!! I give it a 5.
4tmNOZscpBF4ExRpLXrcyA,,,The crab cakes with crawfish sauce was nice. The crawfish fettuccini was super good. The bread pudding with the rum caramel sauce was also good. Our server was super nice the entire time - quick and attentive. Would recommend if you want a quality meal for a reasonable price. Sit upstairs!
4tvc7gY7jCN945y7TIe1kw,,Had the crawfish boil and the oysters and shrimp platter. Not bad but I feel it's overhyped. Service was rather bad which is unsurprising since they had a si or server for at least 8-10 tables. Their mojito tastes like cough syrup. Not worth the wait and long lines.,
4uUFzKBKL1b6GLnPQojoIg,,"I've been coming here for 15 years! For best experience sit at the bar and chat the ""pro"" shuckers!  Norman is the best!  Ask about his awards!  Oysters are awesome as well as the other choices, but I specifically go for oysters and fresh, not frozen, crawfish, when in season,  the way Only Acme can do!",
4ugfkToAyCoS5sWFC39xlA,,"If you like fried seafood, this is the place to go. If you're able to, I would suggest seating at the bar. The men that were shucking the oysters also serve as your waiters. They are very entertaining and full of stories to tell. I think the most noise came from our section at the bar because we couldn't stop laughing from all the jokes they were telling us. Also, say hi ""Hollywood"". He's been there for over 25 years, and he's really proud of being there.",
4ukFZt7Pt9wls8R9wLaHYA,,,FOOD WAS AWESOME!!! Everyone in our party couldn't stop raving about how delicious each dish was. The service was excellent too! Def a must visit when you're looking for a great traditional NOLA meal! Also had a good selection for the vegetarian in your group!

It was a clean spot, the service was fast and friendly. For food my wife ordered the mild 3-piece chicken strips and I ordered the hot chicken sandwich. Plus we ordered the Mac & cheese and that was the best Mac and cheeses We really liked everything. Oh, even the lemonade and sweet tea were really good. 10/10",,
4v0lYaMWD3lC_GCrlP4wig,"I have only been to this place once, normally I go to Prince's Chicken, but I wont lie, this place was very good.  It was a bit over packed and parking was horrible, but once I made it in, it was unbelievable.  The guy who helped me with my order was very nice.  He did messed up, but once I pointed it out, he immediately fixed it.  Once I got home and tried the chicken, I wont lie, It was worth the drive.  I found them very good.  I would not hesitate to recommend them, or even stop by again if I happen to be in the neighborhood.  They are a good hot chicken place to go eat at.  Who ever does stop by, wont regret having spend their money here.",,
4v0vBwesH-OaVCZCuFql0A,,,"Lovely, warm wait staff, but the food was very disappointing. The crab cakes were OK but the Ahi kinda scared me and I think they bought the Bananas Foster frozen at Costco or Sam's Club. Again, waiters and hostesses were super nice, but the quality of food disappointed."

We waited in line for about ten minutes, not long considering how long the line was and I understood why when we were seated and it seemed like the waitress was doing to minimum to get us out of there asap so another group could be seated. She was impatient and didn't listen so she missed orders and didn't refill any of our glasses. But the food was great. Charbroiled oysters were insanely good and the po'boy was great although a little dry. So sit at the bar and get the charbroiled oysters.",
4vO8yDIPyniPgvqklaaaQQ,"Food is great. Chicken platter was a huge portion of 2 pcs, with 2 sides. Couldn't finish it all. Chicken skin was so crispy! And meat was moist. 

We went on a Wednesday night at 8pm and there was a huge line out the door. So we decided to order online thru their website, it was ready for us in like 30 mins. 

I'd say food would be worth the wait.",,

I will say the wait staff and servers were really nice.",

4wUHpgj-dkFFx-t-jXPkTA,,,"There is always a line here to get in, but this time it was moving quickly and we were seated in less than 30 mins. We ordered vegetarian stew, fish and another dish but the order didn't arrive for another hour when the server informed there was an issue with the order and she is addressing it. Another 15 mins go by and nothing is still served and the manager stops by to say she is assisting to expedite our order but there was some issue in the kitchen and offers a complimentary bread pudding for desserts. I asked my server if there is anything on the menu that can immediately be served while we wait for other order and she immediately says Gumbo. And it also makes sense because you'd think it should be already prepared and ready to serve. But then she informs that even gumbo is going to take 15 mins. Finally after 90 mins of ordering we received the food. 

The stew wasn't honestly a stew at all. You'd hope a stew is slow cooked for couple hours on the stove, but the stew here seemed more of marinara sauce with Cajun spices and fresh veggies. You could say that because the veggies were as crisp as just tossed into the sauce (not stew). My friends who ordered the fish and other things liked the food though. 

At the end the server comes around again and brings the check and asks if we 'really' want the complimentary pudding. I don't understand if you aren't sure about offering you shouldn't have offered. I wouldn't recommend this place if you are on short time or have vegetarians in your party. This could be a place where you come in early evening have some drinks while you wait an hour or so for the food."
4wp4XI9AxKNqJima-xahlg,,"What's up with these char-grilled oysters? I know it's all the rage, but all I wanted was fresh oysters. Like every day. So when I got the oysters all char-grilled i was looking forward to trying something new. But really, I felt a little disappointed. Why mess with such a fresh and tasty thing? I know I may be in the minority, but I just wasn't into it. I was able to steal a fresh oyster from the shuckers, which satisfied my craving... a little. 

I also tried the Anita amber, the local brew, which was okay, but nothing mind blowing. And we got a side of  Boo fries, which were fries drowned in gravy and cheddar cheese. Not quite poutine. Not even close. The fires weren't crisp to start with, so the gravy actually made them soggier. Just nothing special, stick to the oysters. Maybe just the fresh ones:)

Just a side note, we waited in line outside to get in, which seemed bad, but honestly we only waited about 15 minutes. We choose to sit at the bar instead of a seat, which I liked more because we could watch them shuck oysters. I know it probably wouldn't be ideal for a larger party, but for two it was great!

Cheers to oysters!",
4xOpNuwqtaJL0Man1S0uww,"DO NOT drink the cool-aid or buy the hype about this place--it is really not too good and the chicken is poor quality as are all of their side items. That tells you something about why they need to make the chicken so hot--so you can't taste anything. Be smart and don't even think about going here, let alone stand in line for a big let down.",,
4xoqqgZ004xyVxSqt_e_qA,,,"Natalie, our server, was the only redeeming quality of our visit.  Gumbo was cold and bland, redfish ""house special"" was ok but nothing special. Etouffee tasted like it had been warmed up from a can. Too bad.  Other reviews had us all excited."
4xwD3xh7MyY5lFyNKmK_lw,,,"Our one stop for food in the French Quarter and it did not disappoint. 

On the sign alone - the promise of seafood - we decided to give this place a shot for lunch. I don't think we could've done better. For an appetizer we had their ""famous"" cooked oysters covered in a delicious sauce I can't even pretend to know how to spell.  What I do know was we loved it - the oysters, though small, tasted very good. And the bread that came with it allowed me to dip it in the excess sauce to mop it all up - a big plus. 

For the actual lunch my wife had their fried oyster po boy while I have the grilled gator sausage po boy. Both arrived to the table super hot and ready. 

The service was awesome as well.  Our server, Jaime (if I recall correctly) was very friendly and accommodating to our questions. She did a great job. 

We loved the place so much were thinking of a return trip (maybe very soon)."

My friend and I were in New Orleans for a conference and I was dying to try some ""staples"": jambalaya, rice and beans, hush puppies and some gumbo.  We went to the one in the French Quarter due to all the raves on Yelp.

We were not disappointed.  I got the New Orleans Medley an got to try pretty much everything on my list.  Plus a side of hush puppies.  The jambalaya and hush puppies are TO DIE FOR!  Amazing!  Shrimp gumbo was good.  Rice and beans I didn't care for.  The andouille sausage was ok.  

Odd that we went to an oyster house and didn't have oysters, but the other food there was AMAZING!  Highly recommend it.  And service was fast.",

We got here right about 12:00 on a Tuesday afternoon and although there was a bit of a line, we only waited about 20 minutes or so and were able to snag a table right after ordering immediately, too. It moves steadily and service was pretty fast as well since you order at the register and they bring the food to your table after.

I got the small order of white meat which is a breast with a wing, and the collard greens and potato salad as my sides. The chicken I got medium flavor which had just enough of a bit of a kick to enjoy it without being too hot. If I wanted my mouth on fire, I'm sure I could've gone up a notch - but I was happy with my choice. 

The chicken had a great crisp and wonderful flavor, and was also hot and juicy inside too. Cooked to perfection. I also enjoyed my sides too. I was very happy with our whole Hattie B's experience, and this location was great too if you wanted to go for dinner and go out to some cool midtown bars afterwards!",,

The shrimps were tiny and were breaded heavily, the bread was also on the stale side and the sandwich was an overall FAIL. However, I give them an extra star for service recovery, a Manager touched the table to apologized. Unless I wake up one day and decide I like Oysters, I won't be back.",

The traditional raw oysters were easily some of the best I've ever had but the chargrilled oysters were so delicious we had to order another dozen.

After devouring those (and some drinks) I ordered an Acme Signature Poboy with a side of hush puppies. Again, both were amazing. The poboy has shredded roast beef on it that mixes with the ham and turkey perfectly.

Acme is definitely a must have for all of our future trips. Bonus points for sitting at the bar.",
51RxCOMM3UQJftCGl5fx9A,,,"Their food is average at best. Not terrible, but nothing that will make you remember them. Worst of all, they fall into that awful category of New Orleans restaurants that wants to tell the customers how to pay for their food. Try to order their take-out, better have cash. I used to work down the street from their restaurant, and tried to give them my business several times, only to be told that take-out is cash only. While their food is tasty enough to satisfy, it is not worth spending an additional $5.00 to pull cash out."

service is friendly and efficient - we ordered the raw oysters and it was already chilled and ready like it was waiting for us.  the crispy, deep-fried crustaceans and bivalves layered between spreads of tabasco-flavored mayo balanced out the 'healthiness' of the lettuce and tomato sprinkled in between the crusty bread.  yum!",

Be prepared to wait in line for over an hour if you get here after 11am. In fact, I'd highly recommend getting here before they open and start lining up. 

Also, if you're not used to spicy food, be warned: you should start with the medium or mild. The ""damn spicy"" us exactly what it sounds like... Really damn spicy!",,

D-He be the hostess with the mostest, fabulous baby. And funny too. 

Hollywood AKA M.-He is the best oyster shucker far and wide. He's been shucking oysters for over 35 years and in doing so has been able to travel the country. Ain't nobody finna shuck an oyster like him. Check the video for proof.

Lily-She is an extremely friendly waitress who is quick-fast on her feet and does everything with a smile. She also knows where to hang out for the night. 

James AKA Mr. Classic Man-He was cool too, but mostly just cute, LOL.

Okay, so my friend and I came to this place after hearing good things about it. Upon our arrival, we noticed that the line was pretty much down the block and were like um no. But the host told us that if we sit at the bar then the wait would only be like 20 minutes. Sounds good I said. Less than ten minutes later, we were inside, at the bar with menus in hand. 

As we sat, waited, and chatted, I learned from the infamous Mr. Hollywood, how to shuck an oyster, what makes an oyster good, how oysters are caught, mad other things about oysters and a little something about clams and mussels too. 

I opted for the charbroiled oysters and the soup of the day, lobster and corn bisque. Fam! That. Food. Was. Legit. Like legit legit. I wanted seconds and thirds but the way my stomach is set up...The bisque, cooked to taste with the right amount of lobster and corn. The oysters, damn them oysters. I wonder if they can be mailed to me. They had the perfect amount of garlicky butter and apparently there was cheese on them which was not overpowering at all. 

My friend had the catfish and fries and was given enough of it to take on home. She absolutely loved it by the way. 

We both got some food to go because it was oh so good. I'm trying to bring it back to Brooklyn but we gon see. 

When it was time to go, we didn't wanna. If I loved here, I'd be here everyday. All day.","I came here because they had food and I was hungry and boy am I glad that I did. There's this beer that they have on the menu that is brewed right in NOLA. The Abita Amber...I'm not one for beer in most cases but it was quite probably the best beer I've ever had. To compliment the deliciousness of the delightful beverage I had seafood gumbo along with the fried and blackened gator. And since this was my first time eating gator I'll describe it as a mixed texture of chicken and fish. The gator was good too, both blackened and fried. Our server was really nice, though I can't remember his name. Lastly, the restroom was very clean."
53pw44uiMAdrvgYKdBs67Q,"While visiting Nashville, I, like other tourists, decided to endure the crazy line in the heat in order to eat more heat. The chicken online looks scary red but don't let that stop you from trying Hattie's. Word of advice, if you want to forgo the hour plus wait, try order online for take out and eat somewhere else. The line was just unbearable for me and my black hair was burning under the sun lol 

I waited in line about an hour thirty minutes before ordering and getting seated. It's self seating so don't be afraid to rub elbows with strangers at the common tables. By the time I got to the register I was really hungry but opted to stay conservative and ordered the small white with collard greens and their Sunday special bacon cheese grits. I opted for medium spicy because hot just seemed too much for me especially after waiting in the heat.

The white was delicious, I was afraid chicken breast might be too dry but it wasn't the case. The wings were a bit small and no meat but the breast was succulent. The best part was the skin! It was crispy to perfection and had the kick from the rub and seasoning. Don't be afraid to get all up in there and ladies don't get depressed when the grease and seasoning gets lodged in your fingernails lol you also get options of dipping sauce so I chose ranch just to have a cooling factor in case my medium was too spicy. 

As for the sides, I thought the collard greens were bland and watery. The grits were also meh. 

As far as drinks the sweet tea was really tasted. The lemonade was a tad bitter. I'm really happy I got to try Nashville hot chicken but would I wait in line again for it? Probably not. Be strategic next time and order for take out it will save you time and effort. Most of the people in like our tourists with carry on cargo anyways. 

The service here was also really nice. Southern hospitality! Overall if you're from out of town I recommend eating Nashville hot chicken however do yourself a favor and either show up right at opening or order take out. Enduring the line is excruciating!",,

54D_ryWafU2zW3Yg4Cin_A,,"The star of the show here is the chargrilled oysters. Full disclosure: until I had tried these, I had only had raw oysters. I do not care for them at all. I had heard so many rave reviews about the chargrilled oysters, including from people who swear they don't like oysters, and I decided to give them a try. They were incredible, and I can now claim I like oysters.

I have shared this experience with several others, all of whom have stated they do not like oysters as they've only tried them raw.  All who have tried the chargrilled oysters at Acme agree that oysters can be delicious when prepared this way and can now say they like oysters.

We have tried a number of the other food items here - po boys, fried platters, boo fries, gumbo, etouffee - all solid choices.  However, they are all a solid four stars, so save your room for those oysters and get yourself a heap of them!","You may have seen a 10% off coupon and asked yourself, ""Is this place worth it?""  The short and to-the-point answer: Undoubtedly yes.

We first tried this place in January 2016. We were looking for some breakfast before our flight, saw that this had good reviews, and had a 10% off coupon to boot. We were not disappointed and have returned with an assortment of people every time we've been in town since. 

We've tried a number of the dishes - the pain perdu, Maw Maw's Cajun breakfast, Paw Paw's Cajun breakfast, crawfish omelet, royal omelet, seafood omelet, alligator sausage, St. James crepe, St. Francis crepe, and a couple of the po boys. I can't pick a favorite as they were all fantastic. 

This place is good for groups and families. The overall atmosphere is consistent with a typical casual dining experience in New Orleans: a bit boisterous, fun, and laid back. We've always had great service and never had to wait too long for our food. The prices are reasonable.  The menu is diverse enough that it also accommodates a variety of palates, so give it a whirl next time you're in the neighborhood!"

552zXxCdWaa0w10CxJHaZQ,,Great food for sure just like the reviews all state. We had the trio to get a good sample of the Louisiana staples along with the chargrilled oysters and the soft shell crab platter. Oh my that was a lot of food. Well worth the time and money. We arrived at 1135 on a Thursday morning and it was already packed but we got right in. Coming out 45mins later the line was out the door.,

55SuBikniNRwz4qdF7vLUQ,,"We ate here twice in the space of two days. Our first meal here was so delicious, which may in part be because we were starving. I had a Peacekeeper sandwich and shared an order of Boo Fries. That first order of Boo Fries was seriously heavenly (fries smothered in beef gravy and cheddar cheese), and the sandwich was quite tasty, if a bit on the dry side. Our second time, we went with the express purpose of getting those Boo Fries again, but sadly they were super salty, so our craving was not satisfied. Luckily the grilled oysters and jambalaya were yummy and made up for the disappointing fries. Drinks were also tasty; I had an Abita seasonal the first time and a cocktail the second night. Yum!  

Service wasn't bad. Atmosphere was loud and friendly (and by ""friendly,"" I mean the male servers would blatantly check me out and say really ""friendly"" things to me while I was on my way back and forth from the bathroom). We were also seated pretty quickly, because we were a large group (7).",
55cxDqfAKR6bJ4v22f9n6Q,"A solid chicken spot. Everyone recommended this place to me when I said I was visiting Nashville, so I went straight there from the airport. The ordering process was easy enough because I ordered online for pickup (which you can do just 15 min in advance). Even at 8:30PM in Thursday there was a small line inside the store, but no where near as bad as it is during peak hours. Because there was still a lot of seating  in the back I got to eat there. 

I got the small dark plate with medium spice and the Nashville comeback sauce. I wish the sauce had a little more punch to it but all around I loved the meal. I would come back again for their hot chicken sandwich because I think that would be more up my alley with all the pickles and coleslaw. 

I'm just sad because this doesn't exist in New York (yet). I need more Southern food in my life.",,"There was quite a long line outside the door when we arrived at 6:30 on a Friday and the line was still there after we finished our dinner. I'm not sure what all the hype is about because the food was good but not like out of this world great.

My party ordered multiple rounds of the fried seafood platter and Cajun fries. The Cajun fries were unexpected but had so many toppings and sauce to them that made it fire. We also liked the Oceana Famous Oysters (chargrilled). As for drinks, the margaritas came bubbling! Very cool. It was slow to order and receive our drinks though.

For some reason they didn't accept our Yelp check in offer of 10% off the bill. Something to do with the fact that we made a reservation...which makes no sense why that would matter. Anyways, try the check in offer, but it might not work."

56DPxiHrTmr_zIZwb7Zftw,"Having done a tour of Nashville's top fried chicken joints, I was pleasantly surprised to see a new one right off the Vanderbilt campus within walking distance from my building so I had to try it and see how it measured up to Nashville's renown Prince's Chicken which seems to be the standard wherever you go.

Walking in, the set-up is similar to Prince's, Bolton's, and Pepperfire, but the decor is more modern than the others.  There's even a TV outside in the patio for people to watch sports.  Unlike the aforementioned chicken spots, Hattie B's offers fountain drinks instead of canned/bottled sodas as well as beers.  

I came here with a friend ordered a the white meat two piece meal.  It came with two sides which I chose as the mac n' cheese and collared greens.  When they asked me how spicy, I said around what medium would be at Prince's which translates to ""hot"" for them.  They were pretty spot on when I tasted it.  Unlike Prince's, which is more of a wet rub for the spicy stuff, this was more in line with Bolton's which seems to be fried on it giving it a nice crunch.  Despite being white meat, they cooked it well and it was still relatively moist on the inside so it wasn't too rough and dry.  The collared greens weren't anything special to write home about, but the mac n' cheese was pretty good; not too creamy, and not too dry.  The person I talked to also recommended the potato salad, but I didn't get to try that.  

It's a little more expensive than Prince's for the chicken, but it does come with the sides which Prince's doesn't (If I remember correctly), and if you had ordered two sides at Prince's with your chicken, it would probably be around the same price so they're pretty competitive on pricing and you save yourself the drive out to Prince's too, so there's something to probably be said about that if you live around the Vanderbilt area.  A benefit for me is that I can walk here from school, but if you need to drive out here, the lot next to it for parking is a bit small so you might have to resort to parking behind Noshville (if that's even allowed) or on the street.

An interesting side note though: The owner spoke to me and my friend while we were eating, and I mentioned that it was spicy, but not too spicy.  He told me that I probably wasn't ready for the ""super spicy"" which wasn't listed on their menu so I'm not sure if he was serious or not.  

While I do love having Prince's and Bolton's, this place saves me from having to actually drive which is a major plus.  I can even imagine myself replacing trips to Prince's with Hattie B's in the future because of the convenience.  If Prince's set up shop around Vanderbilt though... I'd probably be more inclined to eat at Prince's.  I think for people though, it ultimately comes down whether you like your chicken dry on the outside with the spiciness fried in it, or if you like it a little saucy where it's dipped in the spicy sauce.  I like them both, but Hattie B's fries their into the chicken so it's more like Bolton to give a fair comparison.

56GGfi83bWtNIThBNOaBWA,,"Acme oyster house is a must visit place in New Orleans, the grilled oysters are delightful. The crawfish poboys are also a must, I have made it a point to stop here and Felix's every time I visit New Orleans. The only reason I gave this place a four star instead of 5 is the device is slow and their is almost a wait to get in.","This place was great, the food was all around amazing!

The wait staff is also very helpful and prompt which is nice too."

I mean, how bad this place could be if they had an average of 4 stars? We are in New Orleans, and the food is great everywhere! Oh, boy, was I wrong. First of all, this place feels like a dump. We ordered crepes with shrimp, lobster, green peppers and something else. What I got was this huge burrito, the size of a new born baby. All good so far, but then I tasted it: it was greasy, salty, nasty. My daughter ordered a dessert crepe, and hers was old and cold. Huge, mind you. My daughter end up eating an English muffin. After spending over $50 on the most terrible breakfast, we rushed to our tour. 15 minutes later, my stomach felt funny, and I barely made it to a nearby bathroom. I ended up with the worse upset stomach, and I felt sick throughout the day. Needless to say, we regretted our decision dearly. So beware. I have no idea if dinner food is any good here, but breakfast is atrocious. So stay away."

The shrimp po boy was alright but there was nothing whatsoever to distinguish it from a million other fried shrimp sandwiches in the world. And the price to enjoy all this avid nance of mediocrity? 30-40 minute wait minimum, and $33 per person for some oysters, a sandwich, and a beer.",
58P4CVY8VJ-Mtjm3KMS2-A,,"There always seems to be a line waiting outside every time I pass by and so we decided to stop by to eat on a Friday night. The line outside wasn't as bad or maybe because everyone is too busy on Bourbon St. 

My party of 4 ordered 2 dozen charbroiled oysters, 1 dozen raw oysters, boo fries, fried seafood platter and added a soft shell crab for $10. We all split that and left satisfied. We killed the oysters so quick that it was quiet for a good 5 minutes. The boo fries weren't all that but for $5, sure! Ended up tasting similar to chili fries and cheese but that's not a bad thing. The fried fish on the platter was soft and ridiculously hot even after we let it cool down so my friend kept burning his mouth hahaha. The soft shell crab was big, not something you can really split but we tried hehe. Fried oysters weren't our thing so that was the main thing left over. 

Nice to experience Acme because I always hear about it! I just don't like waiting much because I'm an impatient person but I would recommend this place :)",
58Zywwxe2b8rbaHQdrsTsw,"Stopped by during a quick trip to Nashville. We both ordered the tenders - and we are normally big eaters, but could not finish it all with the sides included. Very generous amount of food. Service was very good while ordering (very friendly and personable employee at the register). My only gripe is the level of heat. I can handle spicy well & like it HOT. Based off previous reviews of individuals who said the same about themselves & saying even the ""hot"" & ""medium"" levels were enough for them, I figured ""hot"" would be a good choice - not insanely spicy, not too mild, right? Well, turns out it wasn't that spicy at all to me. I honestly probably could have chosen the highest ""cluck up"" level and still would have been perfectly fine. While it didn't live up to the spice hype (IMO), the flavor was still very good though.",,
58bQNA1IPLnEq1YsL7schA,,,Tourist trap. Tourist trap. Tourist trap. I guess that's expected for the Bourbon Street area. Food is bland and not at all fresh. Would not recommend.
58yXn5Y4409kc9q88YwU6w,,"When I walked in, I was pretty sure I just time warped into a 1990's Bennigans in a sketchy part of town but that didn't stop me from ordering a dozen of freshly shucked oysters, a dozen chargrilled oysters, a plate of fries, and two Purple Hazes like I owned the joint. 

The boy was pretty sure I over-ordered, but I had read the reviews and everybody was absolutely correct. Acme Oyster House will always leave you wanting more.

The locally harvested, raw oysters were on point! Never in my life have I had such plump, juicy, sweet oysters. And at $13 for a dozen...I should have ordered at least a dozen more! No fancy mignonette or cocktail sauce is needed here. A good splash of lemon allowed me to enjoy all of the bi-valve power in their natural state. 

The boy is not as much of a raw oyster fan as I am but he threw back the chargrilled oysters down like a champ. How could you not love anything drowning in a butter and cheese sauce? 

Service is not the friendliest but they are efficient but after two beers, I did not even  notice!

I stopped in at 5 pm on a Wednesday with no line in sight but when I left it was around the block. Plan accordingly!",

5A2yWF3ZPvhZY0dUoIpesQ,"First off let me say that I like hot food. So when my sister told me we need to go to Hattie B's and try the hot chicken I was all in.  Most of my party ordered the medium level chicken both with and without bones. I debated between the hot damn and shut the cluck up heat levels.  I ultimately decided go big or go home so I got the shot the cluck up.  When our chicken arrived everyone else's was a golden brown. But not mine, it was best described as dark chocolate brown. I could already tell it was going to be hot just from the smell. And I was not disappointed I bits into the chicken and my first thought was how good it tasted. My second thought was that my mouth was on fire and my head was sweating like a river. I ordered two breasts and two legs and was able to get through one breast and one leg. My father and wife each tried the tiniest bite of crossed and weren't able to talk for about a half hour. I ate as much as I could but ultimately the two pieces were all I could handle. Fortunately my wife had a little bit of medium left so I got to fill up.

Someone else's review mentioned that if you are going to go with the maximum heat, be sure that you have many bathroom breaks available to you the next day. From experience I can tell you that is very true, starting in the middle of the night and lasting the entire next day. It wasn't that there was anything wrong with the way the chicken was cooked, it's just that it's so darn hot my body couldn't take it! So consider yourself warned!! I think next time I will probably stick with hot.",,
5ADgo4z9FGFNCRg9r2k7sw,"Fantastic little gem within walking distance of my hotel. At noon there was a line around the block so I thought I would come back around  4pm. The line had shrunk down to a dozen or so. Totally worth the wait!

The dark meat leg and thigh with mild sauce was fantastic. So juicy and just the right amount of heat to enjoy the meat. The fries and slaw were a great compliment to the chicken. I took some banana pudding for later and it was a great late night snack. 

Really enjoyed having this option available over chain fast food down the street.  So much more flavor and made with care.",,

Hot chicken, a Nashville thing, is  specialty, is chicken made with a heavy coating  of cayenne (which makes the chicken red). We got the hot and I can't imagine getting the extra hot. Really. I am usually a spice killing machine. 

Despite the spiciness, the flavor was still there, 

I would absolutely go back.",,

We were too lazy to wait in the longgggg line so we ordered pick-up. I got the medium dark meat with mac n cheese and collard greens. I'm salivating just thinking about the meal. The hot chicken was, as the word would suggest, hot. But it was so much more. The crispy skin balances the tender meat inside (I got the dark meat and would recommend that over white meat), and the two sides were great too. Maybe a little too much moisture on the collard greens, but no other complaints.",,

The most impressive part was that I ordered ice coffee. Even though it was not on the drink list , They made the ice coffee just for me."

I, also, had a side of black eye pea salad and greens. When the food came out, they were huge pieces of chicken so pretty happy about that. and OMG the chicken was super moist. The seasoning was so good. My favorite side was the black eye pea salad. Didn't care much for the greens. In fact, i didn't even finish it. But I did finish my black eye pea salad. That is a plus if you are looking for a refreshing light side. 

Pros: 
-Plenty of parking 
-Friendly staff
-Quick service 
-clean bathroom

Cons: 
-None as of right now

5Cq56PNCYUTgV1R3BFM5EA,,"Overall a good experience. It was a long wait outside of the restaurant (opt for first available seating) but we were entertained by a few beggars with corny jokes and street preacher with a speaker fanny pack. It was amusing to hear all the ways I'm going to hell.

Once we finally got into the restaurant, we ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell, half a dozen of the chargrilled oysters and a plate of the Boo fries. 

Boo fries were good. I thought there would be checks of roast beef on them but it turns out it was just gravy. I might have misread the description.

The chargrilled oysters were really tasty. Buttery, garlicky and delicious.

The oysters on the half shell were nice and fresh tasting. My only complaint is that they were a little sandy. Or maybe the outside of the shell wasn't clean? That makes it a little awkward if you are a straight from the shell slurper like me.",

The pimento mac n cheese and the fried tenders are my fav items. Tho I will say I don't think this is the place for grilled tenders. GREAT SPOT,,

My friend and I decided to go around 1pm and only had to wait 5 minutes to get seated. 
I decided to try the chargrilled oysters and my friend had the New Orleans specialty medley. It's easy to see why this place is so popular. The chargrilled oysters are delicious! Some of the best I had in NOLA. The medley was great but I felt the portions to be quite small. Regardless, it was more than satisfying. 
The place is dimly lit and while the space is large, you might have to share a table with others. The service was great and I will definitely pay them another visit next time I'm in town.",

5El0VTbAb-s0PgIcVbS6Kg,,,"Came here around 9am on Sunday morning after reading the Yelp reviews. I was craving for char-grilled oysters, and was happy to hear they were serving them. Of course we also ordered breakfast dish, which was the crawfish omelette with hashbrowns & biscuit. 

Let me start with the crawfish omelette, since it was served first. The chunks of crawfish sticking out of the omelette made it obvious the restuarant doesn't not skimp on ingredients- or portions. Super yummy breakfast I'd eat for dinner.....but then I also eat oysters for breakfast. 

Next came the dozen char-grilled oysters covered in some type of cajun sauce. Not bad, but I felt it was just a tad on the salty side. 

Oceana is a family friendly restaurant where you know you'll get good food, paired with friendly service.

We were taken upstairs and seated by a window with a beautiful view of the street. Our waitress was very friendly and made excellent recommendations.

I'm chatting with other folks in the line for about 5 minutes and my name is called. I have a seat at the bar, greetings all around, place my appetizer/drink order and begin to soak it all in. Acme is not big at all but somehow I thought it was. Long bar along the left wall, several tables with chairs on the right. Big screen tv's with various games on..I'm watching the FIFA Cup Series. When I'm dining solo, my strategy is to try everything I want and share. That way I get to sample different items, meet new people and share the love. 

I started with sausage/ chicken jambalaya. It was divine! Taste lime the one my cousin makes..not too spicy, no tomatoes that I can see. Color was a dirty brown, plump rice with bits of sausage and green onion every so often. Next came the oysters. You have got to try these. Fresh, juicy oysters cooked in the half shell with butter, wine topped with a crunchy parmesean cheese crust...dead. sop up some of that sauce with a piece of bread and ohhhhh!  I happily shared with the guy next to me and he polished them off with the same feelings of ohhhhh that I had. 

Finally, my po boy came in all its glory. Let me just say they are more than generous with the seafood. Lightly breaded oysters and shrimp perfectly fried, crisp lettuce, between a soft Italian bread bun. Mmmm.. it was heaven! Then the spicy Tabasco mayo gets in on the action and amps up the flavor of the whole sandwich. So good!  I couldn't eat it all but I stuffed those last 2 oysters in my belly. Couldn't let those puppies go to waste. 

So for 1 beer, cup of jambalaya, 1/2 doz of grilled oysters and a po boy my total came up to $34. Not bad at all. Get in there you all and eat!",
5Gbm681X5DdiuB8lE5ufjw,,,Don't eat here !! The worst place !! After I ate this I couldn't get out of bed for hours !! WORST STOMACH ACHE !!!!!!!!!! LITERALLY THE WORST STOMACH ACHE IVE EVER HAAD .. I ordered  food and literally 2 min later my food came ? Do they already have everything cooked already ? Do they let the food sit out ? I'm so sick that I don't even know . Be careful y'all . CAME TO FIND OUT I GOT FOOD  POISONING!!!!! SHIT CRAZY
5Gbpoo4q2pgPe83WOiDYQg,,"I saw this place on Triple D and had it on my places to eat while in New Orleans. There was no line and we were able to walk right in. I ordered a  1/2 dozen raw oysters and my friend ordered the chargrilled oysteres to start with and they were very good. I later ordered a platter of food to include fish, oysters, shrimp and french fries. I was disappointed to see that they try to fill the plate with french fries to make it appear to be a lot of food they are serving. How wrong they are. I should have stopped at the oysters because the rest of the meal I could have gone without.",
5GcXBR-P3b-6q8gD2071xw,,The line was out the door for dinner but it moved quickly. Good oysters and seafood etouffee,
5GdNdNkHNcCi5KLlHBZO7A,,,We got a great service from EZRA G. In addition to one of the tastiest dishes of sea food in New Orleans
5Go6Xta8Md6Tuo2aRTFfEA,,"Our last day in New Orleans and had a couple of hours to kill before heading to the airport. We heard so much about the grilled oysters we gave it a shot. Of course there was a line but since we were only 2 they pulled us and sat us at the oyster bar. ""Storming Normin"" was our server and Shucker. Nice, friendly and full of stories. We ordered dozen raw oysters, dozen grilled oysters and topped it off with an oyster po'boy. We had a lot of oysters! Everything was fantastic and the grilled oysters lived up to their reputation. It's noisy, crowded, fast paced a reasonably priced. Highly recommend this place for a true Louisiana experience! Enjoy!!!",
5Gtvp9QWyrF0-bdb2Xcq8w,,"We made the mistake of ordering six chargrilled oysters to share with various other appetisers. Should have ordered more oysters as they were delicious! The other appetisers were pretty basic deep fried seafood (shrimp/crawfish tails) and debris fries and we were full by the time our oysters arrived. Just go and get the oysters, no question! They are HUGE and come with French bread you can dip in the herb butter and you'll be very happy!",Great place! Went here twice. The bbq shrimp were delicious. Only downfall is it was slightly on the pricey side. Great service too.
5H6BPTeebp8v2Em63PWfZA,,,Best Catfish I have ever eaten in my life. Went at lunch with friends and my husband and I shared. I tell everyone where to go for good Fried Catfish!
5HItAyFRYew4yogdHE6-ow,Great food. You know it's good when people wait in line in the heat for it. I've seen people pass out. It's worth the wait. Definitely try the peach cobbler.,,
5HM5laVyf0qfPTiEw1c26w,,,The locals all told us that this is one of the best places to eat and they were right! Staff is awesome and food is even better. Get the Jambalaya!!! AMAZING! Thanks for all of the great local tips Errol. ;)
5HvoEfrna6Oq1PkMMiaSgw,,,Delicious Food. Excellent service our waiter Chris M was very helpful and made good food suggestions. I'll be back!
5IDOHpkKaD5JqhoPCa1Csw,This lived up to the hype. Though i have to say i would never stand in the hours long line people wait in! Go online and order for pickup! You can then eat your food in the patio area there. We were able to order for an hour before pickup time because it was so busy. I got the mild fried chicken sandwich. The sauce on it was incredible and the pickles were perfect with it. I got the pimento Mac and cheese which was to die for! My friend got the fries which she also enjoyed. I will be back!,,

We all had a few different Arbita drafts since we don't get that much in our area.  Turbo Dog and The Blueberry wheat were very popular with our group.  And you can't ever go wrong with their chargrilled oysters, they were much better than others we tried in some other restaurants.  

Since it was mid August and a weekday there was no wait which also makes things better.",
5I_m0ndUSO2UCfzWKomXLQ,,,Oysters & bloody Mary's were amazing! Our server Kat was great. Definitely recommend!
5IztdSqxQjCriZ6hF1L9zA,"A must-visit place, especially if you like Nashville hot chicken or have never had it before. The place is obviously popular. The line typically stretches down the sidewalk. Regardless, the food is worth the wait. They offer white or dark chicken in different portion sizes. They also offer chicken strips. The chicken is fried and is available in different levels of hotness. You can order mild, medium, hot, to unbelievably hot. We were a party of four. We tried medium and hot. The hot had a kick, but it was not unpleasant. All of us thought that the chicken was outstanding. The sides were also very good. We plan to visit on a regular basis, but only when we don't mind standing in line for 30 minutes or so. I highly encourage you to experience it for yourself.",,
5JEvxShM2nt2PBUMlZzgeg,,,"The food was exceptional but the service by far was the highlight. The bartender was friendly and made the perfect Bloody Mary while I was waiting for my party. Our waiter, Errol was patient while we had a hard time deciding what to order. He gave us the best attentive service. I had the French toast and have never had French toast taste so amazing. This restaurant is a must."
5JPgkaGFw483642TClS6Xw,,,The food and service are decent. However they increased the prices just last few days.  Last week the crab cake appetizer was 14 and today (12/29) it is 16.5.  Main dishes are $3 more.  Waitress says she doesn't know anything about the price increase but they have a new condensed menu for New Years week.
5JYHQmxjtpW8PwUrkVwf6A,,,"Great food and service again! Even though this may look like a bar, the food and service is always fabulous. Know that there are two locations though and the one I have been to is the larger one on Conti St. The alligator bites are great and the blackened catfish is fresh. I wouldn't recommend the hurricane from here but that is not their specialty. The staff is friendly and helpful with selections."
5KAWbKPfn1MTQdVSmPCvrQ,"All I can say is wow!!! Great chicken and sides, be careful because they mean what they say when it comes to ""hot chicken"". There was a long line but definitely worth the wait. A must try if you are in Nashville. Not to be missed!!!",,

I was almost going to skip out on visiting because I figured there would be nothing for me. I was wrong. If you're with a meat-eating friend and deciding whether it's worth your while to tag along, the answer is yes.

Fries are great. Mac and cheese is great. Southern greens are great. Banana pudding is the holy freaking GRAIL. Put it all together and baby, you got a stew going. I mean, a full meal. Get it in my mouth right now.",,
5LhZtBd2KW84SIbmrEhRvg,,Very very good! Shrimp poboy and seafood platter divine. Ordered shrimp poboy and seafood platter more than enough food for two people,Delicious food! Big servings. Had shrimp and seafood platter more than enough food for 2 people
5MKEz3UqPVomyo-Vk9wX2Q,,,"This was the first restaurant we went to when we arrived! We noticed that it wasn't super crowded, but we didn't pay any mind because it was raining pretty heavily. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. He recommended certain dishes and delivered that famous ""Southern Hospitality."" We got a half order of oysters, and I got Shrimp Creole. The Oysters were very good, but I could taste that fishy taste after a while. The Shrimp Creole was pretty good, but very simple. I also had a Rajun Cajun Bloody Mary, which was great. Everything, overall, was very pleasant....until I got food poisoning. I was up all night at the hospital and let's just say that I couldn't really eat any other seafood the rest of my visit. That was one of the grossest nights ever! I would skip this place if you have a sensitive stomach."
5MLpqOIOb-IVog1SYXtJAg,,"Here celebrating our 24th wedding anniversary . We're from Cali and this is one our  favorite restaurant in New Orleans. It's right in the French corners right off Bourbon Street. It's not too expensive and  appetizers,our meals, and drinks were around $80 plus tip. I absolutely adore and love the Char-grilled oysters.  Today, the wait wasn't that long. Trust me, I've seen the line go down the block.The line went rather quickly. Hurricane Claudine was supposed to hit but didn't so that might be the factor with the lines today. #Yay. Today, I ordered my favorite soft shell crab po' boy and char-grilled oysters. The server asked if I wanted to add crab on my oysters and I said yes. I think I like my oysters without the crab but nevertheless I devoured them. My husband ordered the boom boom shrimp and a basic cheeseburger. Not really impressed with his burger because you can have that anywhere but I did have to try the boom boom shrimp.The boom boom shrimp was delicious and I'm now a fan of the boom boom shrimp. I highly recommend Acme house because it never disappoints and it's all that . Thanks!",

The crab cakes are the best we have had in NOLA. Almost as good as Boston.  The blackened chicken is so good that words cannot express.  The hurricane was okay, not the strongest around and don't get the frozen ones here.  
Friend shrimp is good. Oysters Rockefeller was delicious (except a little gritty for me). 
Overall very nice dinner and seated upstairs was wonderful and just private enough."
5N4boULtdtVjTEqNtso2Rw,"Wow was this ever good. Have intended stopping here every time I came through Nashville and finally was able to.   Guaranteed, I will be back.

Can't wait to for my next trip to Nashville.",,

The food was great and so were the employees! The etouffee and the shrimp po boy were to die for! If you can, sit near Norman. He was so entertaining that he was able to get my picky spouse to try oysters for the first time!",
5ODrmWFmiqUieUPtlHQSxQ,,,"The atmosphere and staff was very nice and welcoming, however the food was very underwhelming. Which was extremely disappointing. One of the main reasons I went to New Orleans was because of the rumored great food. The food wasn't seasoned and lacked any flavor. If you find yourself in New Orleans stay away from the touristy restaurants, travel outside the bourbon street area and get some real local food! The only reason I gave this place two stars is because the staff was so nice"
5OKEvsrOFwJfC83NP6BNrA,,Totally worth going here. Had chargrilled oysters for the first time instead of raw and they did not disappoint. Everything hit the spot.,

Ordered the hot. ...yee haw!glad I didn't order extra hot. ..I thought I could handle any hot. It was fab..and spicy! Chicken is nicely fried, great crisp batter.
Sides are delish. Definitely recommend mac n cheese. .creamy goodness. 
Potato salad ""refreshing"" as my daughter said. 
One kid got mild. ..swears it was too hot? ! He thought the fries were a bit spicy too.
One kid got medium. .ate it. .but was happy to have ranch dressing. 
Ordered Banana pudding and berry cobbler. I know everyone says banana. ..but our gang Loved the cobbler. .with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",,
5ORGcy9HOgKF_0vLxNzu5g,,"This is literally my favorite restaurant in all of New Orleans, my 2nd time here but still always great. For a drink I ordered a Hurricane thing was super strong but good as well, for the appetizer we ordered Chargrilled Oysters; PURE GREATNESS thing was sooooooo good I wanted to order more but I had to save space for my Fried Peacemaker Po-Boy it tasted magnificent. Only 5 stars max but ACME gets 10/5 stars this place is perfect. The only knock about my experience yesterday is we waited in line for like 45 minutes but you can't complain about that it's a busy place a lot of traffic but some of the staff had a strange way of letting people in, there was a party of 3 behind us and ahead of us in line and we were a party of 4 at one point after we been waiting in line for maybe 25 minutes and they let in a party of 12 that came way after us which made no sense whatsoever you have parties of 3 then 4 then 3 in line why not seat them at a table since you don't take reservations? And the staff member I spoke with couldn't really explain the reasoning behind it like I said that was the only small knock but the staff was super nice and food and drinks were great so no effect on my overall rating still my favorite restaurant in New Orleans and I'm still coming back anytime I'm in town!","Great ambience love the design of this restaurant, it looks small when you walk in but it's huge. To drink I had a swamp drink that was really good and strong I also the Blackened Bayou Duck it was so good. Our waitress Chantay was also amazing super nice super friendly all around great service I recommend this restaurant for sure and I will definitely be back for more"
5OTwlTWhZVr4ImWZNy4OSw,We were on a trip to Tennessee and had to check out this amazing place. Yes there is an insane line to wait in... But yes it is definitely worth the wait. I ordered the 3 piece chicken tender plate in the medium heat. It had a nice little kick but not too much heat. The chicken was so juicy and full of flavor. I ordered the pimento Mac n cheese and coleslaw for sides. Loved them. The Mac n cheese was by far my favorite side out of all the places we visited that week! The chicken was amazing as well! I would definitely return if I'm in Tennessee again in the future. Seating is very limited inside but there's plenty of room outside... And hey you already stood outside in line so sitting outside won't be too bad... And you will be eating that wonderful chicken so you won't even care about the weather outside!!! We waited about an hour in line but it was worth it!!!,,
5OaFQ_RSid2hmnCVCvvCAw,,"Looking for great Chargrilled oysters in the French Quarter? Then look no further. Acme Oyster House on Iberville street offers a delicious variety of oysters (raw and chargrilled), gumbo soup, jambalaya, soft shell crab, etc. The atmosphere is also great. There is usually a line up outside to be seated since the restaurant is on the smaller side; however, it really doesn't take long to get seated. Plus its all part of the fun. If you are in the french quarter then definitely stop over at Acme's for some oysters.",
5P1cVSmosrjT2m8vsjlaiA,,"I love love LOVE their charGrilled oysters and now you can get Cr r ab meat on top.  YUMMY

my wife had an  po boy and she loves it.  A delicious and moist jambalaya and we had an excellent meal seated at the  bar with fast and friendly service.",

We were greeted outside by a friendly door hostess, the restaurant was full but lucked out and we were able to be immediately seated at the bar (last 2 seats), our favorite place to sit!! Curtis, our bartender, took great care of us & checked on us frequently. This was the perfect ending to my birthday weekend in New Orleans. We loved every bit of the great food & hospitality in New Orleans.",
5PBv2wUX7Dd2hsDOQUkKwQ,,,Food was pretty average - restaurant leans towards quantity over quality.  Had a large piece of blackened red fish that was way overcooked. Greens were decent and jambalaya lacked flavor. Gumbo was average at best - Roux seemed a bit thin. Restaurant feels very touristy. Would not return.
5Pbf688IVpLxzWOLTlk9pg,"Long wait in line outside for seat yourself, food was ok. Not what the hype was about",,
5PoJWp3Qb2wtp12XHCssCQ,,"I love this place!!! It's a must go-to place every time I come to NOLA!  They just never disappoint me with the food. Had the service been good this last time, I would have given them 5-stars. Check this place out though!",
5PtkFEymTrtxdZ9Wys5s8g,,"Even on a weekday this place has a line outside its door an hour after opening! Came here minutes after they had opened looking to do some serious grub on action for their infamous CHARGRILLED OYSTERS. We had ordered a set of fresh raw oysters, ordered a pound of crawfish that our server mentioned to us that was on sale for $9.99l/b, and an order of fries. My boyfriend order an Abita on tap, and I stuck with my water.

CHARGRILLED is by far the best thing I've eaten in New Orleans. It will not disappoint. The little slices of white bread as absolutely essential for cleaning the shells with leftover butter and Parmesan residue.

Service here that day was a little neglectful, nothing came out together, but I'm pretty sure that was all just because they literally just opened doors for the day. After all their normal opening hours are 11am and we were already eating at 11:21!

Get the Chargrilled Oysters.",
5Q3J19sYxOMqXtQklNo50g,"I have nothing really negative to say about this place. I only rate 4 stars because I feel their price point is a little higher than it deserves. 

That being said it was delicious and tasty as advertised. Took a long while for my chicken but thats entirely understandable. The whole chicken and the chicken tenders are two different beasts. I HIGHLY recommend ordering whole chicken pieces.",,
5Q4W--SfD-NOxNyl3EfZrA,,"Went there based on several recommendations. We left disappointed, this is very over hyped. The customer service was the worst we've had so far on our trip. The food wasn't particularly special, not bad by any means, but not amazing. Maybe it was just an off night.",
5QKlCSShzMYqjJUJtagkiw,,,"I'm giving this place 4 stars because we were seated and served pretty quickly. Everyone in my group ordered some form of sea food and I tasted it and it was delicious and the portions were big. I ordered the grilled chicken Alfredo and the portion size is deceitfully small. It's spread out over a large plate so when I finished it I was still just as hungry as when I entered. I tried to tell our waiter about it but he just laughed it off and left as quickly as he could. For a 17$ plate I felt robbed. 
And the soda lacked flavoring it was only carbonated water."
5QLeXdHTgOK-6MV0gTeE5A,,This place always has a wait and a line outside but it's worth the wait. The oysters are super fresh and served with a fantastic cocktail sauce. The shrimp po boy was pretty good but not as good as thee oysters on the half shell.,
5QYyeNQBh7adoqggmK-HUA,"Worth the wait! The line was over 20 people long when we arrived, but within 15 minutes we were devouring Hattie B's Hot Chicken. The chicken is obviously the reason for the wait, but the banana pudding is the way to close out the experience!",,
5QbRmYe6K53dSC8AoBCcJA,"Not sure what all the fuss is about.  There are better hot chicken places in Nashville.  Sure, go to say ""I've eaten at Hattie B's"", but once you have, I don't think you will be dying to go back anytime soon.  And definitely not worth the ""line around the block"" wait.",,
5RDDnKTOSluaqHrzwhX63Q,,"My husband and I went to New Orleans for vacation.  Our first stop was Acme Oyster House.  Tourists love it here and the wait is RIDICULOUS!  For my first meal in NOLA, I liked it - I thought the raw oysters were good and fresh, but I was not blown away by the food.  The char-grilled oysters was my fave - that was by far the highlight of the meal.  The oyster goes on the grill and then it's topped with butter and garlic... majorly drool worthy!!!  

We also got their soft shell crab platter - nothing to write home about... the crab was super meaty, but it was just deep fried and nothing special about it.  The seafood etoufee and gumbo are southern classics, but I didn't love either of them.  The gumbo was salty while the seafood etoufee didn't have enough seafood flavor.  The crab and corn bisque though was delicious - light and great flavor.

At first, I would've recommended Acme Oyster House, but after going to Felix's Restaurant (right across the street) and Luke's, I don't think I could come back here and enjoy it as much as I did the first time.  The quality of the food just doesn't compare to the other places.",
5RGKJ1zGgbnqUDUOdSL65A,,"To be honest, traveling to New Orleans was a spontaneous stop on our way to Texas.  I found this place driving around town and from word of mouth from the locals.  Words can not describe the great ambiance and tasteful food.  When you first approach the restaurant, you do have to wait a little bit (appox 5 mins - 10 mins), depending on the wait, outside.  Yep, you heard it right, outside.  As a Floridian, I haven't been to a restaurant outside to get a table inside.  I know it may sound weird, but trust me it is everything and more for the wait.  Anyway, people were getting called fast by table number, so make sure you know how many people are in your party ahead of time in order to ensure efficiency.  My best friend and I were called in roughly 10 minutes and were seated by the center of the restaurant.  To be in a city that has 300 years of city was breathtaking and being in a restaurant well known in the south was just the cherry on top.
Our server greeted us with the southern hospitality we all love and know so much about.  She walked us through the entire menu and suggested their famous Chargrilled Oysters.  Now, if you are like me a seafood fiend, I don't turn down any type of seafood.  When she said char-grilled, I was like ""huh"" and I asked about a 100 questions.  Not really, but I had to know what this was.  I have eaten raw, steamed, and fried oysters but never Chargriled.  Apparently, Chargrilled is Oysters grilled to perfection, but were seasoned with a garlic butter sauce before cooking.  I decided to order a dozen and !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.  Each bite was succulent, delicious, out of this world, fantastic, mouthwatering, may I go on?  I wanted to order another dozen but unfortunately I became full.  Horrible.  If you are not a seafood fiend, but love spicy/cajun food, ACME offers a variety of southern food from good old Po'Boys to their famous Gumbo.
I was very enthusiastic and grateful to experience this amazing restaurant  with it's glorious culture.  I highly recommend this place to those out of town.  I can't wait go back this year and kill a plate of those Chargrilled Oysters.  If you love history with a good southern twist, look no further.

Happy Yelping,
Ricky",

5R_MFFLhv7zx-mrKElCNgQ,,"This place always does have a long line, but trust me, well worth the wait. Their oysters are absolutely delicious! Try a pitcher of their house beer, it's really tasty and pairs well with all the seafood. We tried a bit of everything: gumbo, crab & corn chowder, andouille sausage, jambalaya BUT hands down, my favorite thing was their red beans & rice. Order anything on the menu plus the oysters, beer, and a large side of their red beans & rice. Great food & even better prices!",
5RhE6tDc2xH6ySYGiSjiGQ,,"The last time I ate at Acme was about 15 years ago. It was not a memorable experience and since that time I avoided it having categorized it, in my mind, as a tourist trap. 
After all these years I decided to give it another shot. 
Yes it is a tourist trap and yes the lines are egregiously long. 
But this return visit changed my mind about the food. 
Our party of four feasted on raw oysters and charbroiled oysters and they were very good. The red sauce that accompanied the raw food was a perfect complement. The creamy sauce that came with the charbroiled version was equally good. 
Not just satisfied with oysters I ordered shrimp etouffe with crawfish tails. OMG!!!
The food more than made up for grumpy service with an attitude and the wait. 
Will be back!",
5ScD_m8nMSg1Zezl50yR6w,,Everything we had was wonderful. The Seafood Gumbo and Chargrill Oysters were delicious! Service was prompt and friendly. I will definitely visit again! Yummy!!!,

You have to get there before noon to avoid lines. But it is well worth it.",
5TBYTZc1-DgRXKAsDeuTig,Just to good. I only went twice or three times because the line is always out the door and for good reason. Can't beat the price either or the casual set up. It's tight and small so it's a bit of a wait during busy times.,,

I ordered dark meat large shut the cluck up spicness.  Pimento mac and cheese, creamy cole slaw, and a scoop of ice cream.  

The chicken was absolutely delicious although it was pretty spicy.  Nice to try once but wouldn't order that level of spiciness often.  Very crispy skin and juicy chicken.  The spices had alot of flavor and definetly vame through even with the heat.  Came with two slices of bread and some pickles.  

The creamy slaw was nice relief from the heat but definetly tasted bland.

The pimento mac and cheese was really good very creamy and had some heat to it.

Ice cream was just plain vanilla ice cream nothing special but very cheap.",,
5TPIiqBAmqZt6gp4t8p-ug,"I ordered the southern level fried chicken, it was ridiculously delicious.
The skin is a bit salty but you should bite the skin and the meat together for a perfect umami. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. I think this is my new standard for good fried chicken.",,

5U9BCh32sOMKOwWOlppH0g,,"The charbroiled oysters are huge and taste great. This place gets really hyped up though, so sometimes the line stretches down the block to get in. The oysters are good, but not ""wait in line for an hour"" good. If you have the option, just try back when there isn't a line.",
5UDAYvL8ZoYtOG8gHldc_Q,,"This is a MUST do. Like the other reviews say, the line may seem long outside but don't let it deter you. It will go quick , the place is way bigger than it appears. 
We stopped at Felix's across the street for a bloody, put it in a to-go cup and waited in line for 15mins. So worth it.
You HAVE to get the char-broiled oysters to start. Even for non-oyster lovers . . This is a bucket list item. 
I got the seafood po boy, it was just ok. But, the slow-cooked roast beef is probably the best I ever had. Go for lunch on your 1st day in town , you won't regret it. 
If you get Will as your waiter, your in even better hands.

5UddWFxC536scKMuYDinBQ,Long wait but totally worth it. Amazing service and amazing food. Their chicken lives up to the hype but if you aren't ready for the heat you'll be leaving in tears!,,
5UgUdUL8YS-doEo9I3itcA,,,"Went for dinner, our wait wasn't terrible, we had good timing. Once we were seated, we ordered as an appetizer the bbq shrimp, chargrilled oysters (Oceana specialty), and were sharing our meal of the Redfish specialty dish. Drinks came fast, then they told us they were out of the chargrilled oysters and could only get the raw, had them before and were not impressed. Why can't you just chargrill some raw ones?? Probably because the kitchen really doesn't cook your food fresh. Then we got our Redfish, it was over cooked or tasted like microwave leftovers. The sauce over it was fresh and the mashed potatoes with vegetables (it was just corn) were fine. Oh then they realized that the bbq shrimp should have come out first, they brought us the bbq shrimp and the sauce was really tasty. The shrimp was NOT gulf shrimp and it had a dinner roll stuffed into the sauce. I appreciate the effort, but I wanted some true New Orleans crunchy French bread, I asked and our waitress said they had not had any since COVID. If your going, don't wait in the long line, and don't think your getting something special. Nothing was picture worthy."
5VB6mr6ZthlDHEJdgLsQDA,,"Just chomped on 2 dozen oysters, fresh and chargrilled!!  Yikes so much better than Cali. The Cajun medley was great. Just the right portion sizes. Great fresh seafood!!!",
5VJlTN7a3kXkHOctR04MaQ,,,"We started with their famous char broiled oysters in a garlic mushroom cream sauce. I prefer raw oysters but these were so tasty and the sauce so delicious I'm hooked. Definitely a must have.

I got the blackened duck with an ettouffee cream sauce. The duck is smoked for 24 hours and then fried before serving. The duck was still tender and moist. It had a side of creole jambalaya and mustard greens. The greens were delicious.  The jambalaya was good but I prefer the cajun version better.

The wife got the blackened redfish with ettouffee sauce with the same sides. I got to try the fish and it was moist and cooked perfectly.  The spice level was spot on. 

We started with Swamp Tea and a hurricane and man were they tasty.

Can't wait to go back to New Orleans and hit this place up again."
5VMpCWG1rVsKUwjVShD_lw,,,Horrible. Found ALOT of oyster shell in my po boy. They got snippy when advised. Could care less about customer sat. Don't let the line outside fool you with MANY other choices in the area. CAUTION!!!
5VeR8MocJOGsHLRSPZScPw,Definitely worth visiting even if you have had other Nashville Hot chicken before. The taste is superb  and the sides are excellent.,,
5WAXxFPAKY-VDfbXREao1Q,"Hattie B's hot chicken is the best hot chicken that I have had since moving to Nashville. The line is sometimes fairly long, but the best part is that you can order online and have it delivered to your door with Uber Eats in less than 30 minutes! If it's your first time experiencing Hattie B's, I recommend eating at one of the locations (which is what I did as well), however the online order tasted just as fresh (and hot!).",,
5WEIhWcLGO3_1cwd9aVEWQ,,"I've been coming to Acme for many years while growing up visiting new orleans for Jazz Fest and it never disappoints. This year we got there around 5pm on Sunday to beat the dinner crowd which can sometimes have you standing in line for hours waiting for a table. Luckily we only had to wait about 15 mins before getting seated. The inside of Acme is super casual, with a mix of individual tables and communal seating at large picnic tables with classic checkered table clothes. The lighting is dim and the vibe is lively with people ready to dig into some seafood.

We got the chargrilled oysters to start, of course. This is a dish that everyone will love, even if they claim they don't like oysters, as did some of the people we were dining with. These are buttery and covered in parmesan and so delicious. And soaking up the oil/sauce in the bottom of the dish with the bread slices is just as good as the oysters themselves - this is why we come to Acme! For the main, we got some boiled crawfish and a seafood platter with fried shrimp, fried oysters, and crabcake to share. The crawfish were the biggest ones I had while in new orleans, super meaty tails that were easy to peel out of the shell, I could eat these all day. 

Fried seafood is pretty much all you'll find on this menu outside of the oysters and some apps but its delicious. The fried oysters were so tender and the shrimp was nice and meaty and paired really well with the arrangement of sauces they bring. My only complaint was with the crabcake which is fried as an entire patty and a bit more bready than I prefer. We got hushpuppies on the side, which were as yummy as ever! Overall, this is a fun, must-visit place when in new orleans!",
5WYEm4bfSBIaTSw_LSgLrg,,,Food is consistently great!  Been here many times and will keep coming back. Service was friendly and polite but very busy.
5WiR90Af3ru32ctRbtAEgg,,Worth the long lines! So yummy:-),
5XJ1g1Rj5tF5pMcPdXEQQA,,,"Where do I start!? The food was fantastic. The drinks were delicious. I got the red fish special, tough break it probably won't be available when you come, but woweeee. Mary helped us out and she was a sweetheart. Very attentive and was exactly what I hoped for in my first dinner in New Orleans. Definitely come in. Definitely eat. You'll love it."
5XLUh68LGJxP7NDhSCvUWg,,,Service was very good. Staff was friendly. Didn't rush us with any part of the meal. I had the redfish and my wife had ravioli. Both were excellent.  It seems like a number of restaurants in the quarter just rush you thru as fast as possible. We did not feel that way at all. And prices were reasonable.
5XdA2WDgAuix-rGQQUyiDg,"Went 3pm on a Wednesday and did not have to wait. Friendly staff. Ordered ""hot"" and it certainly was, but enjoyable. Recommend the pimento mac and cheese. Banana pudding is not something I'd usually order, but it was honestly the best part of the meal!",,
5Xkpuu0yzkqFDqyhf6j1Dw,,,"We understand it is covid, and service may be slow, but with that being said, service was not slow. Our server never once came to the table accept to order our drinks, food, and drop the food. I felt as though as soon as we sat and said waters all the way around, she decided we were not the table to care about. We were a party of 8, we ordered 2 appetizers, and they came out about 1 minute before our food was brought to the table. Our server never refilled anyone's drink. The crab cakes tasted off, the fried shrimp in the PO-boy tasted freezer burnt. The manager did not seem to care all to much. When he came to ask about the crab cakes he tried to argue that the crab cakes where fine, but he stopped and took them off the check. Now if you have every worked at a restaurant then you understand you can get in the weeds, but Chelsie (worst server I have had in a long time) when confronted on our bad service, pace of meal, and lack of care for a party that would have paid a nice tip on a $140 tab, simply stated she had 5 tables and was swamped. If you cannot handle 5 tables as a server, you should find a different job. None the less, you should not laugh when your guest says they are having/had a bad experience. So piece of advise Chelsie, do better next time and you will get paid."
5Y5NieHvFsWk-WZxy-CJJA,"If you are in Nashville, try this place out!! We did have to wait for about 30 minutes to get through the line but it was 12:00 for lunch so very busy. It's a small building. Everyone is very nice that works there! We got our food pretty quick after ordering. I got the SM dark, which is a leg and thigh, bread, & 2 sides. I got baked beans and Mac&cheese.

The beans were good. Mac&cheese had a different flavor to it but delicious! My husband got the French fries and wow, they were amazing!!! 

Chicken was amazing! I got southern which is no heat. Crispy coating and juicy chicken! It was so delicious; mouth is watering writing this post! Yum, yum, yum!!",,
5Y9kT4rqvBhubKkpvCiqiA,,,"First, the service was great. For the high customer volume our waiter still checked in on us regularly, made us feel welcome, and when the bartender forgot olives in my dirty martini--I know right?--he immediately noticed the missing detail and promptly brought olives by. Service was 5 stars. 

With regard to the food, however, I feel like the challenge for any business claiming so many accolades amidst such a touristy scene is to still create a fine dining experience despite it all. It all felt like the food quality had succumbed to the customer volume demands. It was adequate, but it wasn't mind blowing. For breakfast on the same day, I visited Cochon on the other side of town and was blown away by the oysters whereas at Oceana, I just thought theirs were OK.

Drinks were average, too."
5YEx9Yh8UyG9tU5TF4NZXg,Super yummy! Worth the wait! Definitely would come back here next time I'm in Nashville.,,
5YJ5Jado3qloALvxf4MxWw,,"What a delicious dinner!!!  The Chargrilled Oysters were so tasty, as was the Oysters Rockefeller Soup!  Mmm mmmm mmmm!  The service was fast, though I'm told there is often a wait line outside.  My companion ordered the fried crawfish po-boy which paled in comparison to the oyster dishes, but hey- it's an OYSTER house, so it's not surprising that's what they do best.  Highly recommended.",
5YSZ8yxf8i8a5U8WovoqRA,,,"I'm in this restaurant twice a week  Which means the food is absolutely great. My favorite dishes is the rockefeller oysters of course, it has the spinach smoke bacon and Pernod liqueur with parmesan cheese. You have to try it. But most definitely the blackened ribeye steak with the jambalaya and veggies. Service always good and of course my favorite bartender there is Josh. He is great, always keeps a smile and he gives good customer service."
5YUvPCHXZ-x2M5TKQUz3Lw,,,Great place for fried catfish.  You'd better make a reservation a week in advance or you might have to wait an hour to get inside but it is worth it!
5YlRAMnThD2tcjp-VLd-5g,"Hot Chicken and cold beer...does it get any better?  Damn Hot all the way, I can give or take the sides but lets real life is full of entrees why would I want to fill up on beans?  If you don't want to watch your fingertips melt off, try going for the tenders-all the flavor without the work.  Your body will probably hate you in ~8 hrs or so, but its totally worth it!  Best Hot Chicken in Nashville, hands down!",,
5Z7TnonIoVqTrSTgtugBTw,,,I came to New Orleans to see my sister and to eat some fantastic shrimp. She brought me to Oceana's and I can say it's one of the best BBQ shrimp I've ever had at a restaurant! I will definitely be coming back here to eat more shrimp and try their other food delights!
5ZCeGCshD9ukDvNglM7K9g,,"We were definitely happy with the food! It's well worth all the wait if you ever have a chance to visit New Orleans. We passed by Acme the first couple days and decided to wait for a weekday thinking it would be shorter lines. We were wrong. This place is always packed. The earlier you go the better chance it is the line does not reach the end of the street. There was only two of us so we didn't have to wait too long. The hostess said 40 min but we only waited about 10 min...the first time we went. Did I mention it was so delicious that we had to come back again the next day!!!! This time we had to wait about the 40-45 min but well worth it! We had the chargrilled oysters, soft shell platter, sampler platter that came with jambalaya-red beans and rice-gumbo and spicy sausage, breaded and fried crab claws and crawdads. I also had a prickly pear mojito. Yummy!!! The chargrilled oysters are out of this world!!!!!!! They are cooked to perfection. Warm and not rubbery. Seasoned with the perfect amount of herbs and cheese.",
5ZFGnaIS4wq-j08pu5khEA,,"AMAZING!!!  Worth the wait. This was a return visit after two years. I only came for the char grilled oysters. I have been craving these little gems.

I have tried many other restaurants that claim they cook ""Acme Oysters"" and nothing comes close.

Stand in the line because the wait is worth it. 

FYI, I did eat 1/2 dozen raw and 1/2 dozen char grilled oysters in the restaurant across the street, before this visit.",
5ZZEH-8gtQZcgunkrwMDTw,"As a visitor to Nashville, I was hoping to get some delicious Southern chicken, and Hattie B's did not disappoint. The line is super long, but the hot chicken was bomb and the sides were solid too. Definitely would recommend going to this place.",,
5Zsyhk8obmttCQbXA3rwtA,,"Bit of a disappointment.  We came here expecting a great dinner the night before leaving New Orleans and it was just ok.

The raw oysters were the best because they were really fresh and clean.  We also tried the grilled oysters, but they had way too much cheese on them.  The cup of Etouffe lacked flavor and the oyster Po Boy was not much better.  

Good place to come for some fresh oysters as an appetizer.","We had a great dining experience here.  The service was friendly even though we did have to wait in line for about 25 minutes.  The helpings are large and our server was great.   We had the ""Taste of New Orleans"" platter and that was very flavorful.  The cup of gumbo was also good and the real treat was the special Ahi Tuna that was stuffed with crabmeat..............fantastic!  

It was a good way to start our NOLA vacay and explore the great dishes of New Orleans."
5_5ZJ1ol8aq2hh103eedDw,,"Their char-grilled or the fresh oysters are to die for!!!!!!!!! I went two days in a row and then bought a po-boy to go to eat at the airport. Should've gotten 2 po-boys not 1.... 
Their etouffe with fried crawfish is also very good!! Gumbo is a bit salty.",
5_Raxw1urP4Hz9YEMniesg,,,OMG the loaded fries with gravy and cheese are something I would order as my last meal! I would highly recommend this place to get a nice New Orleans flare! I ordered the taste of New Orleans to get a nice sample of all that it has to offer although by far the fries and the crab cake appetizers were the best.
5_cX7xtHjrc0bAP-PmbMBg,,"During my stay in New Orleans, I tried numerous chargrilled oysters and this place was definitely the best. I wanted to lick my plate. The ""shuckers"" were very entertaining and watching their speed was memorizing. Great place!",
5_igwVXdvmfZu7PjaRT0Tg,I'm a Nashville native. Never grew up eating hot chicken. Don't know where this craze came from. It is a cute place and nice vibe but the chicken just isn't for me. I've eaten it twice now. I just don't like the breading. I do enjoy sitting there and having a beer.,,
5_voA-Un8flF_jf0Ih465A,,,"We went to Oceana Grill this past Monday. We had a reservation for 4 at 7:15.  We were lucky to have a reservation because the line for tables wrapped around the block--I'm sure the carnival season had something to do with that line but still.

Our waiter was nice and suggested the most popular items.
We ordered the oysters to start which was covered in Parmesan cheese and a creamy herb sauce. Really delicious but the taste of the oysters was lost in all of the flavor 
And my partner and I ordered- a taste of New Orleans which came with jambalaya, crawfish étouffe and red beans and rice with smoked sausage 
And I got the blackened redfish. It was good but nothing too crazy.
We enjoyed the bread pudding dessert which seems to be one of the most ordered items, we saw so many pass by on plates while we were eating. 

One of our friends ordered a couple drinks and said they were all sweet and delicious. One of the drinks even came with a little smoke lol.

It's definitely a nice spot to hang out and chill. People took their time eating and took even longer to leave the restaurant after paying the bill."
5a1X2vL8KHe3jhcRvWrnBQ,,"Wonderful little restaurant!! Food was delish and service was great. Boo Fries are yummy!! Soft Shell Crab, Fried Shrimp, Jumbalia, Chargrilled Oysters they were all good!! A lot of food!!Go enjoy you won't be sorry!",
5axupyLoGaIIR2bZPrpIHg,,,I had the crabcake pasta there last month. The sauce was great but the crabcake was meh!

5bBmz_Y0Cbcvj9o6CqbIyA,,The best oysters!!!! the soft shell crab was really great here too. Friendly staff and very good customer service. When I head back out to New Orleans again it will be a must to go back too. :),

DOWN TO ITS A LITTLE HOT IN HERE...nice selection of sides ...get there early for lunch its get a little crowded... and watch for the parking.. kind of on the scarce side.. but got go its a Nashvill experience...,,
5bk5M-1WylC18bzt7uZX9w,"I LOVE Hattie B's and have to visit every time I come home to Nashville. The chicken is obviously amazing. Pro tip: get the Hot chicken fingers because they are easier to eat. The spiciness varies occasionally each time, so just be warned if you avoid really spicy foods. If you come on a Sunday, you can get chicken and waffles and/or cheese grits. Also, you can call it ahead and pick it up to avoid waiting in the long line.",,
5bkVxglD7q11GF8_iMSGnQ,,"Chose this place because my wife is not a seafood eater. I had the grilled oysters and the medley. She had the sausage poor boy!
Oysters were fantastic! I only ordered 1/2 dozen because I wanted to eat all my dinner but wished I could have had more. 
The medley was jambalaya, gumbo, red beans and rice. Absolutely amazing!
Will definitely be back here!",
5brVyYOgkbT_ibCUrxoRiQ,,"Myself and 8 others selected this restaurant for a Saturday evening meal but only 3 of 9 enjoyed their food. Personally speaking I ordered the New Orleans Medley which included gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans and rice. I'm not sure if the food was lack luster due to us arriving late in the evening or if they just had a bad night but my food lacked flavor overall. The jambalaya was dry and the gumbo and red beans and rice needed more seasoning.

We did receive good service. The staff were quite nice and friendly.",
5cYoSptjNwQeaDTAiDt8WQ,,Early lunch on Sunday. Rhonda gave us excellent and attentive service.  She was very helpful with beverage and food suggestions and info. The crab cakes were the best that i have had.  My wife loved the boom boom shrimp and boo fries.  I had the Killer Buzz cocktail at Ronda's suggestion and enjoyed that also.,
5cfAcNe7iEiv4ASI-UasdQ,,"Amazing service, amazing oysters, amazing experience.

I'm not a picky eater, but I was still a little unsure about oysters.  I'd had them before once or twice, drowned in cocktail sauce.  A little hesitantly, we ordered a half dozen raw to start with, and I ordered their famed oyster po-boy for my entree.

The raw oysters were a pleasant surprise; extremely fresh tasting without any sand or grit that you can get from other places.  I threw a little hot sauce on one and that was perfect!  The oyster po-boy was an entirely different beast - fried gloriousness - but awesome in its own right.  I'm not a huge fan of fried food (okay, I am, but I hate the way it makes me feel afterward so I usually avoid it) but the batter on these oysters was not greasy at all.  Crunchy, with a slightly spicy kick to it.

To top it off, the waiter was really efficient and friendly.  He refilled our drinks before I even realized the glasses were missing from the table.  We don't get that kind of service in New York, especially at an affordable restaurant like this.",
5dK7rSjS9e3Mqd2nSWOxeg,,Can't go to New Orleans without hitting Acme...chargrilled oyster pleaseeeeee!,
5dS2zFOhVIt9ydQEFuaRKQ,,,Great recommendation from our hotel! Friendly staff. The flavors of the food were great. Wait time was fine. Portion sizes were very generous.  The drinks were on point as well.  Very happy with the entire experience. Good job to all!

5eHCluRT06CKPKKfoM9UhA,,,"The overall experience was disappointing.  The food once it got to our table was made of good quality ingredients.  The wait for food was extremely slow. The shrimp po boy had 4 tiny shrimp not anything like the photo in the menu. It was tasty for the four bites out of 16 that had shrimp. For 15 dollars, the sandwich was poor at best.   Will not come back and will warn others of the experience.  The hotels push it very hard and get a kickback for promoting the 10 percent discount. A tourist trap.  Too bad, it could have been so much better if they had delivered the food on time and added a lot more shrimp."
5eKI5IE1LhtzUzE_DDWc8A,"Wow that was a spicy as ass chicken I ever have eaten in my life!
I had oNe shut the Cluck up chicken wing that's their hottest flavor then I had the chicken sandwich with damn hot second hottest flavor why the chicken wing was a burning sensation I don't think I can handle every day the sandwich was pure heaven I just wish I could get this in Houston if they open a location I think I will go once a week at least.

There's probably not much else I can adhere with so many reviews when I was there it was at 5595 I'm sure it's more now as I'm writing this review please come to Houston I will be one of your loyal customers for sure also bringing any of my friends love love spicy goodness:)'",,
5ebgNVoc37tBel3vuLzHvw,,"After a year of living here and avoiding Acme oyster house, I finally stood in that line. I feel like I am writing this review only to guide people who may be a little lost when choosing a place to eat in NOLA and because you likely are already going to go here with or without my blessing. 

First it has to be said, this is not the best place to eat. With that out of the way, it's not terrible. The line outside is completely over hyped and the food is so so for NOLA which means it will still rate as a 4.8 for non locals. 

Menu do's: 

Chargrilled oysters (better at Jacques imos and every across the street at felix's)
Crawfish hushpuppies
Oyster Rockefeller soup
Fried crab claws

We also has the boiled crawfish. Order this if you can't make it to a boil while you are in town. It doesn't come with all of the fixins most boils come with like potatoes and corn and garlic, etc. but it was solid. Not to salty which was nice.

The atmosphere is very lowbrow and buzzy. Try sitting at the bar if your party is small enough. It's cool to interact with the oyster shuckers and they are super knowledgeable and honest about the menu. Stick to beer or wine. Mixed drinks are on that basic as hell Applebee's level (remember that margarita from college you thought was good until you could afford a real drink? This is them.)

Although the fireworks were missing from me at Acme, you won't ruin your trip and you will leave satisfied when you go here.",
5f4UjxbMJwTPgmrHsB4DSg,,"After standing in a long line (~45mins) we were able to sit at the bar (2 ppl). We ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters, a dozen raw oysters and a side of seafood gumbo with rice. The chargrilled oysters were cooked in butter and a rich seasoning. It was divine! It was recommended to use a drop of chipotle tobacco for each oyster to gave it a smokey flavor. We used the bread to sop up leftover oyster-butter sauce. The raw oysters were fresh and very mild. The side of seafood gumbo was also very tasty but overwhelmingly salty for me (-1). 
Overall the service was quick (once we got a seat of course). I would recommend going here if there was a short line, but if it was as long as it was for us, you should go across the street to felix.. i'm sure they get their oysters from the same place.",

5gT1R-EthZ3eGsrP8r79dg,"The whole experience was the best, similar to our Pittsburg PA excursion when we went to Primanti Brothers for there world known sandwiches...pull up to the joint and a minor search for parking ended with a primo spot. Walked up to the building and we were 15th in line to get in. Took about 20 minutes and we were in the door. This is when it can get challenging, order and wait for a seat, we ordered 2 half chickens 1-hot 1-mild with fries, Mac n cheese, greens and Coleslaw. I got a Pilsner ... 2 by the time we received our meals and just as we ordered a couple finished their meal and vacated a table.... Joey moved in and bingo, we have a table. We waited about 20 minutes for the food to be delivered to the table and we dug in. The mild chicken which I ordered was slamming good, crispy and hot.... Not greasy and full of flavor, Joey likes the spicy stuff and he loved his. He said it was hot but not offensive. The greens were bacon less but were tender and very flavorful. The coleslaw and Mac n cheese need some work, but I'm not there for sides.  Chicken was meaty and big and quite fulfilling. Nashville hot chicken is something that's  making its way back east.... We have some of the best wing spots in the nation so it might take some time before it catches on. 
 This place just gets it done.... Expect to wait, expect to rub elbows and expect to be satisfied when you leave. It's a great spot to say hello to strangers and diversify. Loved it!!!",,
5gkdhh228EdYsW8CDo53VQ,,,"The food was incredibly bad. I usually do not leave comment card but in this case I did.  No response from the Oceana Grill as of today.  
I had the shrimp po-boy.  The shrimp tasted like small rocks that had been fried.  The sauce that seemed an after thought was ok, but the small amount they put on the Po  Boy didn't allow me to taste it.  Overall one of the worst meals I have had to fight through."

The boiled crawfish were packed with flavor, it has a lemon pimento, peppery type of taste which was yummy! The seafood etouffe was flavorful too.  I'm not a big fan of fried food anywhere really because I can't stand overly battered foods...but my bf wanted to try to friend crawfish, of course I ended up taking off the batter before eating.",

Yes, there was an initial frightening burn but, it did level out to a good even heat. Even though it was scorchingly volcanic I could still taste the juicy fresh chicken and that wonderful crispy skin! The sauce is not just heat it packs a very flavorful punch! This level of heat is indeed not for the timid...most mortals would be wise to choose a milder version of this delectable treat. I ate the whole order...except for the white bread at the bottom that soaked up some of that firey hell sauce! Sweated a bit, eyes watering, mouth on fire, nose running,etc. Whatever you do...wash your hands as thoroughly as possible! And never touch your eyes or any other delicate areas afterward! Believe me, I took those precautions quite seriously! Oh...also try the mac&cheese!",,

I counted it a major win when the hostess came down the line looking for a party of 5 to be seated right away (and we were)!  Our waiter, Brian, was on the money.  He made great recommendations and his timing to the table was always perfect.

The portions here were filling and the ambiance was family-friendly.  We made friends with the people at the table next to us, which further enhanced our experience.  I highly recommend trying the seafood pastas and the specialty drinks.  You won't be disappointed."
5iKKJn8j-ybKsvZGk3E6Vg,,As an appetizer I ordered the roast beef cheddar fries they were very good! For my aunt I ordered the fish and shrimp combination. The fish was crispy just the way I liked it!,

5iN-abK277ymGQs6HWvNqg,I'm a Nashville resident and I even love Hattie B's. This place isn't just for tourists. Key to getting the food fast is placing an online order. It'll be fresh and prompt to eat and you can eat it in the restaurant. You'll skip the entire line. This place never disappoints,,

Also ordered the delicious ""Boo Fries"" which are some good ol american french fires smothered in what tastes like a thanksgiving gravy sauce with  but is actually just some bomb roast beef",

Highly recommended!!!!!!!
We all 8ppl enjoyed and were so happy.
Great job guys",
5iuLx3_sSyXz3GXXsgERcg,,"Raw oysters were delicious, but not worth waiting in line for.  I was most looking forward to the char-grilled oysters and they were tasty in that they had a super butter-garlic flavor.  Could  you tell that there was an oyster in there?  Not really as the oyster shrivels to nothing in the shell, and the best part sopping up the juices with your bread.

Otherwise, pretty standard New Orleans standards.  The shrimp gumbo didn't actually have any shrimp in it.  I guess that counts as a complaint thought the flavor was good.  The red beans and rice were above average though I preferred Popeye's so . . .

On a final note the crawpuppies were delicious as seemingly all the fried foods are done well.  In any case there ain't no magic being performed here.  Fresh, raw oysters done well and points for the historic nature of the business (since 1910).",
5ivDUhw0YyAYSRoMEu1ODA,,,"Redfish was amazing.  Very big serving for lunch.  Excellent service!   Shrimp Po Boy was also really good.  Had it grilled instead and fried.  Fries were also very good. 

Great atmosphere too.  Had lunch on a Monday and it was very busy."
5jK2Q0ERz6nipc1BI7OzTw,"We were in town for my husbands birthday with dinner reservations planned for the entire weekend but we knew we had to try Hattie B's. The hour wait to get in was well worth it. My sisters and I split the hot chicken sandwich, fries, and dirty bird fries (we had dinner reservations so we wanted to keep it small). I have never had a better hot chicken sandwich! The chicken was crispy but tender and the bread was soft but a slight crunch from the way it was toasted. The sauce was finger licking good! We were almost tempted to cancel our dinner plans just to order more of sandwich, it was that good!
The Dirty Bird fries were also delicious but I would definitely stick with the sandwich if it's your first time. Will definitely try the LA one to see if there's a difference.",,
5jPcYriIZLTVC9xst29Mjg,,The line was long but the greeters were moving people in and out if there so fast so the wait didnt seem so bad. The restaurant is decent just a little dark kind of dingy but lets talk about the food. Chargrilled oysters were so good freaking amazing and the softshell crab was well seasoned I should have gotten two. All and all I enjoyed my experience at the Acme Oyster House!,
5jwBiol-rMJGqBozyAvt1w,"So I'm not a fan of the ""wet"" style fried skin on fried chicken BUT this chicken was pretty tasty... we had the MEDIUM and it had a little kick!  Love the crinkle fries and the 2 little sliced pickles that they top the chicken with.  You walk up to the counter and order then pay.  They give you a number to set on your table... the inside dining is pretty small but they have a large enclosed tent style patio with more tables.  The workers are hustling and the cooks are getting the food cooked pretty quickly!  I hope Miss Hattie is RICH!  There was alot of traffic in and out of that joint! OH - parking is slim pickins...",,

The inside didn't have a ton of space, but that's okay. What it lacked in size it made up for with flavor! This was hands down, the best fried chicken I have ever had. The side of potato salad was very good as well. The cole saw was underwhelming, but I still rate this place a 5/5!",,
5kzwJQLgjrK-Aiu9qRH_xw,"Let me tell you how much we loved this place. It was our first stop when we got to town, and we loved it so much...we opted to skip our final day breakfast plans, and just wait for Hattie B's to open for lunch before we left town. 

Get the chicken strips with extra pickles. I'm telling you the bite with chicken, a pickle, ranch and a little Mac and cheese is the perfect bite to ever exist. 

They are lying about their spice levels...so do with that what you will...especially if you have plans after eating!",,

5l4qx2pgq4_lNnKl4xjuUw,,,"We asked our night concierge at Inn on St. Ann for a ""local food"" recommendation for dinner and he suggested oceana, which is where his wife works. We were not disappointed either!  Located right off Bourbon across from the Royal Sonesta hotel, it's convenient and yummy. We started off with a bbq shrimp app. if you haven't had Cajun bbq shrimp, it's different than you would expect. It's neither ""skewer-grilled"" nor is there ""bbq sauce"" involved; it's a spicy soupy liquid that the shrimp are served in. These were large gulf shrimps that had a delicious kick of flavor in my mouth. While I like spicy foods and think food is ""just right"" when my nose runs after eating, I don't think they were ""too spicy"" unless you are completely spice adverse. I followed the bbq shrimp with red beans and rice with sausage. What can I say, it was a spicy Cajun kinda day. My boyfriend had catfish. There was so much food!!!! Both meals were large enough to have split and we both left some on the plates, and rolled out of there anyway."

The charbroiled is prepared in a buttery, garlic sauce sprinkled with cheese which makes you taste buds cheer with pleasure. Our waiter was good even though there's always a wait to get in and he was busy with a bachelor party next to us. We also had the fried crab clams and fried crawfish. That plus a few beers and it was like heaven.",
5l_PqZ5JyHP4zNqBh5Ksog,,"I am going to sum up this place in one word: Touristy. The Oysters on the hald shell was sub-par in comparison to other places I've eaten in NOLA. I had to wait 45 minutes for a party of three. There are a lot of fried items (typical New Orleans) and nothing very special. This place is way too overpriced. I felt like I was paying for the name than the food, meaning I could say i've eaten at Acme once.... I will never go back.",
5lnTMD4jf9cJmBeYduAcSw,,,"Great place, definitely kid friendly and very courteous. Food was amazing, tried gator bites as an appetizer to try something new and was not disappointed. Kids loved the fish and shrimp from the kids menu and we all sampled from the other items that we ordered, Cajun pasta was good, blackened chicken fettuccine, and the pasta with crawfish, shrimp, and crab cake. One child spilled water and the wait staff was so nice about cleaning it up. Also had a place for us to put our stroller while we ate. Would recommend!"
5m-p2ddJBi4nIXWSglVGEQ,,"Mmmm fried oysters!  I love fried oysters.  Therefore, my first meal in Nola HAD to consist of fried oysters!  My boss mentioned Acme Oyster House as a place to definitely check out when I'm in town.  So I find out it was only a couple blocks from my hotel, so why not.  

I sat at the bar, to avoid a wait for a table.  Ordered an Abita Turbodog (yummm!) and looked over the menu.  I ordered the Peacemaker, which is a fried oyster and shrimp po'boy.   I always remembered po'boys to be small sandwiches... this one was HUGE!  I only finished half of the bread, but of course all the fried goodness that was inbetween.  

I also ordered an oyster shooter, not really knowing what I was getting myself into.  The raw oyster I could do... the whisky concotion that the oyster was swimming in... I could not.  Ugh, I felt so gross afterwards. BUT at least I can say I did an oyster shooter now!

The bartender was very attentive and helpful in deciding what to order.  I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Nola.",
5mB5hOFKtM9YCs-Yytl9Lg,,"So many people suggested chargrilled oysters, I just had to give them a try. I was blown away! I like oysters, but I honestly don't know if I could ever have a raw oyster again without fantasizing these. The spices and garlic are invigorating as they're brought fresh off the grill. Get them! You won't be disappointed.

I also had their gumbo, which was delicious and modestly apportioned with seafood, which is all I was looking for this trip to NOLA. Not the best I've ever had, but up there.

The etouffé with fried crawfish was also delicious, but warm: like it had been sitting out a bit. A stark difference from the hot and fresh oysters and gumbo from before.

If you're going with 1-3 other people, prepare to share a table. Embrace it. It enhances the experience! Make friends. It's NOLA and the conversations are lively!",

One of my favorite's in the Quarter!"
5noyHxD9eN4Kej3wDvjUHw,"This was my first hot chicken experience, and I loved it. We dropped in on a rainy afternoon, grabbed a seat on the covered porch, and dug into the spicy, lard-y delight that is hot chicken. Pair that with local microbrews, and it doesn't get much better for your grease fix.

My companion and I split a half chicken, which was plenty for two. We ordered ""hot"", and found it to be the right level. The skin was laced with cayenne, but did not overwhelm our saucy palates. A delight. The rich, creamy bacon and cheese grits were the icing on the chicken, so to speak.

Hattie B's may not have the shack authenticity of some of the originals, but it provides several things that they don't: great beer on tap and seating. I would come back.",,
5ns1iqE7YjL-3TI5BSN-_g,,"Went here for dinner. Horrible. Jambalaya tasted like it was made with dog food, super dry. Oysters were full of shells and over cooked. Just gross and over priced, take your $$ elsewhere.",

The fried fish was perfect and flakey. We also had fried shrimp that was tasty. The cocktail sauce had a lot of horseradish and it made my eyes water, just the way I like it! You surely want this place on your list of places to eat!",Awesome late night eatery. We were a bit silly on hurricanes from Bourbon Street and they obviously knew it. Our server had a good laugh with us about it and made us feel better (who'd of though we were not the first ones). We loved the gumbo. It had awesome sea food and crab. We also got the tour of New Orleans. The jambalaya was my favorite and the red beans was my wife's favorite. Great experience!

Must haves:
*Blackened Alligator bites (if its you're first time get the half/half - blackened and fried)
*Red Fish
...I think anything blackened will be delicious here

Don't get:
*Any Fettucine...just not worth it...probably just not the best noodle for the pasta

Crab cakes were good but the alligator bites are better"

5rIOb0YU9li0xF2cBlY9Rg,,"Our first night in New Orleans, wanted something close to where we were staying (in the French Quarter) and casual.  The hotel recommended Acme.  There was a line outside, which we took as a good sign.  The wait (on a Friday night) was about a half hour...not bad.

First impression...the place was dirty.  Our table/chairs still had debris from the previous occupants.  The menus were worn and dirty.

We each had a cocktail, and followed up with local beers...all OK. 

We ordered a half dozen of both the raw and char-grilled oysters.  In both cases, the flavor was good.  Some of the raw oysters were absolutely huge...so if you're experimenting with raw oysters for the first time, this might not be the place.  However, our biggest gripe was that there had been no attempt to clean the mud/muck off the shells, so it was almost impossible to eat them without also getting some of that as well.  We needed extra napkins just to wipe the mud off our hands after picking them up.

My wife had a half a Po-Boy with a cup of smoked sausage gumbo.  I had the fried seafood platter.  In retrospect, we should have checked the menu beforehand...neither of us are big fried-food eaters, and that's pretty much all that was on the menu (seafood-wise).  That said, I enjoyed the fried fish...not so much the shrimp and oysters.  My wife liked her gumbo...and the Po-Boy was kind of meh.  The quantities were generous.

All said, the recommendation from the hotel was on target in terms of being casual and close by.  If you like fried seafood, I suppose it is worth a try.  For us, I think we could have done a lot better for our first night in NOLA.",
5rU96Q9jTp-FusY9oQfVxw,,Chargrilled oysters are amazing. Came at off time and got right in. If your in NOLA this is a must! Staff is super friendly & helpful.,

I got the mild and the flavor was perfect but I will be getting medium next time! The boyfriend got damn hot and shut the cluck up... can I just as that for a guy who puts ghost pepper on EVERYTHING, shut the cluck up with STILL a mistake?! That stuff is on fire!!! However, the chicken was so good- perfectly seasoned and tender-, he proceeded to order hot chicken at ever restaurant we went to afterwards. Still, Hattie B's was by far the best and so we are coming here again before we fly out tomorrow. The sides were also very good. Special shout out to the mac and cheese and the peach cobbler. Both were amazing!!  A local let us in on a secret, you have to place your order online for pick up and you can sail past the line outside.

If you are here with a group be prepared to wait as there usually is a line, but it's worth it! Being alone I didn't have to wait long to be seated at the bar. I met some lovely couples and some friendly Australians as well.

I ordered the char grilled oysters which were delicious. What's not to love? Oysters smothered in butter and cheese. Served with bread to soak up that lovely sauce. This along with the Abita amber make a nice combination. On a recommendation I also tried the local Andy gator beer, which had a bit more bitter notes too it. Since I don't enjoy bitter beers, I liked the Abita amber more.

Everything we ate was amazing  we had the crab cakes, barbecue shrimp, their special oysters and a signature breakfast dish that used eggplant instead of English muffins for a kind of Benedict.  Oh, and their frozen hurricanes -- very refreshing on a humid February day.   Sadly, we didnt have room for dessert.

Service both times were impeccable.  Ponce made us feel like we were old family friends vs tourists.  The atmosphere is fun and quirky; Hostesses were friendly and cheerful."

The chargrilled oysters were delicious. It was the first time I had ever had oysters and I would definitely have them again. I also got their oyster shooter which is a half shot of vodka with a raw oyster and the house sauce. That was also excellent! I was quite surprised. 

We split the fried seafood platter that had catfish, oysters, and shrimp as our entree. The fried oysters weren't nearly as tasty as the chargrilled oysters but the platter was good, nonetheless. 

The only negative was that we had to share a table with two other people. There were chairs between us but it was still kinda odd. 
All in all, I highly recommend this place to people visiting New Orleans.",

5tXRxr4T24Awl7vjyCvIcQ,"I was told when coming to Nashville to try out Nashville-Style Hot Chicken, and this was one of the spots that a lot of folks clucked about. I was forewarned about the line situation. I think to wait in long lines for a singular food item, like hot chicken or cronuts is such an interesting human behavior but as you can see from the majority of the reviews, folks don't have a problem with it. 

A friend and I had just eaten breakfast and decided to mosey over and be first in line before they opened up. As we waited the line grew and grew 'til it snaked around the side of the patio and down the block. While we had scoped out the menu and had an idea of what we wanted to eat, no one prepares you for the pressure of being first in line (of nearly 50 people by the time they opened their doors). Risa did it right. If you have any issues with ""order fright"" as I like to refer to it as, order to-go and two-step passed the line. 

Walking up to the counter once the doors swung open, I saw Chicken & Waffles, and was like, ""oo, can I get that?!"" Chicken & Waffles is only on Sunday, folks. After fumbling a bit, I ordered a Small Dark Hot! with potato salad and cole slaw. My friend who was equally flustered ordered Chicken Tenders Southern-style, and tripped up over ordering her sides, and asked the cashier to just pick the two best sides. The cashier wasn't really looking to help out my buddy, and yes there was a line behind us waiting for us to complete our order. We got her sides in, paid, and...we didn't get a ticket or anything, so we kind of felt like chickens in a coop just standing around. It definitely is an order, grab, go-type spot with little staff interaction from what I can tell. That being said, it's efficient and the folks were pleasant that put together our order. 

Maybe eating on their patio is the way to go (it gets a bit claustrophobic/packed and the cooking aromas are quite strong inside). This way your chicken is still hot, you can order a beer to drink with your chicken which I'm sure is delightful, and maybe really experience Hattie B's. We took ours to go. The chicken was well-cooked, the heat level was tolerable and good, but I wasn't blown away. The sides were also good, but not anything to shake my tail feathers at. 

I know a three-star review isn't the majority here, so take the suggestions of ordering to-go (but still eating on their patio) with a cold beer to enjoy your hot (hot) chicken and other suggestions brought on by five-star reviews, and you'll probably really enjoy your experience! I am no Nashville Hot Chicken connoisseur but if I do return I'd like to try them out again along with other NHC high standard spots.",,

As an Indian, spicy is the norm for me, but the Damn Hot (Level 4 out of 5) chicken had me second-guessing many life choices. The server's glances of pity/nervous admiration should have been a warning, but I was too arrogant to register it, until after. I took my meal home and ate it next to the rubbish bin, refusing to admit that I was treating my stomach similarly. Physical symptoms included: tears of fear, anguish, and euphoria, intestinal rumblings, and hot flushes during consumption.

We were greeted by four people before we made it to our table, only twenty feet from the door. Our server was very helpful with recommendations on their selections. I had the cajun omelette, which was so good. 
The portions were good size for the price. I was very full after breakfast. 
I highly recommend stopping by."

Came out Luke warm and the skimpy amount of sauce on it was skimmed over like it had been setting in the window way to long and the medium poached eggs were hard. I told waiter and ordered a different breakfast. The server was very professional and nice. The manager came over to the table and opened with ""what do you want"" I just stared at him, I had no idea who he was (ya never know in New Orleans) then he says "" oh I'm the manager what's wrong"". Enough said"

Venture from these, you may not like it. Étouffée was served with shrimp although crawfish are now in season, bIg disappointment. Crab cake was better than average. Our server was honest and steered us away from a few of the desserts. She was spot on with the pecan cobbler, delicious. Not the best meal you'll have in NOLA, but better than average and worth the money.",
5viS6hNancoYFxhU7f3_nQ,,,Good food. Stayed a week in new Orleans.. Ate here 3 times. Lol. It was that good. Catfish was the best I've ever had. Alligator bites were delicious as well.
5wS3wae3kGc5zxUoVjmoZg,,,We're visiting from Michigan its about 10 of us. I've been to the restaurant before but the a service last night was impressive. Mary our server was knowledgeable. Of the food and ingredients. She was more than helpful and an overall genuinely kind person. Keep her we need more employees like that in the restaurant industry. We'll return and hopefully shell be there when we do.

How am I to do that if I haven't been to each hot chicken eatery in the city?  Thus began another challenge that I posed for myself.  Hattie B's!  My friend and I ventured out to the 19th Ave location.  Seating is a bit limited but that is to be expected to get the true feel of a hot chicken shack.  The bathroom is in an odd spot but it's cool.  It's clean.  The service is great .  Smiles and helpfulness abound.  Long lines, hot chicken, decent sides, and BEER.  The hot is on par with other's medium to me but it was still delicious.  Will I go back .. for sure.  Would I recommend it .. abso-freakin-lutely.  Is it my favorite .. not really but that's another review all together.",,
5x3TJCAH_3YtGa4xMZ357w,,,Was very surprised. It took an hour and 20 minutes to get our order. The service sucked but the food was delicious. It's hard to say if the wait was worth it or not. If the wait wasn't so long I would definitely give this place a 5 star.
5x5VEM8miw6QNHv0N5O1pA,,,I brought my family to Oceana Grill on their first visit to New Orleans and they absolutely loved it! They have amazing oysters and I love their Redfish Pontchartrain. Their crab cakes are also delicious! We will definitely be returning.
5xBDYRJ1QnNjMBTUst85EA,,,"It can be hard to choose a place to eat when you're in the French Quarter. Oceana was recommended to us by Champagne from Grenoble House, and we decided to give it a try. It was one of the highlights of our trip. My husband and I ate at the bar, and Darreck was absolutely amazing. He was engaging and thoughtful, helpful with recommendations, and seemed genuinely interested in making conversation without being intrusive or overbearing. Genuine is a great word to describe the meal. The food was genuine New Orleans cuisine. The atmosphere was genuinely beautiful and quaint. It was a busy place to have a secluded meal. The setting was beautiful, the people were kind, and the food was delicious. Honestly delicious. We didn't meet the chefs, but I hope someone can pass our compliments along. 10/10 could not recommend more."
5xRqXhee5BfemhC_M8pksg,"We decided to order carryout for lunch yesterday for the client I am working at in town this week.  As soon as we asked the staff if they would like Hattie B's for lunch, they perked up.  We attempted to order delivery (link takes you to Uber Eats) via their website, however it said delivery was unavailable for some reason.  No big deal, we continued with carryout.  

We scheduled pickup for 11:30 and got there on the dot.  The link was well outside the building and lined up down the sidewalk.  We walked in, asked for our order under my name, and carried it out with no problems.  This was my first Hattie B's experience despite hearing about it for the past few years up the road in Louisville.  We have a couple of hot chicken places in Louisville that I am a fan of, so I was excited to see how this compares.  

I ordered the jumbo chicken tenders, medium heat, with ranch and Comeback Sauce.  I got fries and pimento mac & cheese for sides, and peach cobbler for dessert.  The chicken tenders were amazing, with great flavor and heat, unlike some ""hot chicken"" I've had before where it is just hot to be hot without much flavor.  The chicken was definitely worth the hype.  Additionally, I am a die-hard ranch fan, however you have to get the comeback sauce.  It is way better than ranch.  

I wasn't a big fan of the pimento mac & cheese, despite loving pimento cheese.  Additionally, I was very disappointed in the peach cobbler.  It was way too gooey and had some sort of translucent goo that I couldn't even identify.  I had two bites and tossed it.  Would not get again.  

Overall, the chicken is well worth the hype.  I'd get different sides next time and forgo the dessert.  The chicken and sides are plenty more than enough to fill you up that you won't have room for dessert anyways.  Our clients were happy for the lunch, which made it worth it!",,
5xl6ZvsXSTpPD8pOKDZJtg,,,"Great for a taste of NOLA food. Add this on your To Do List if you're a tourist. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and it was amazing! It was the best out of all the 4 entrees we ordered. We also got the oyster P.O. boy, Taste of New Orleans and Seafood Gumbo. Personally, the seafood gumbo was nothing special. The oyster P.O. boy, don't bother and go with the shrimp..but I don't really fancy oysters. The Taste of New Orleans was just okay. Basically...get the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. It was perfect for our first meal in NOLA. 

Also, the wait can get long so plan accordingly."
5xxI2JMKSyPNCLpXOgPaig,"Great fried chicken in a casual patio atmosphere. They specialize in Nashville ""hot"" chicken. It's fried chicken with cayenne pepper in the batter. Got a two piece leg and thigh. One done hot and one medium. 
I heard it was going to light my mouth on fire or at least but the hot version barely raised my temperature but was pleasantly seasoned. That said it was damn good fried chicken, juicy and hot. 
Only downside was the wait. It was Thursday at 6:30pm and the line was out the door to the sidewalk. I waited 25 minutes to order then another half hour to be served.",,

I had the taste of New Orleans but wasn't too impressed, but the red beans and rice were very good. What I was impressed with however was the chargrilled oysters they were FIRE! The sauce was extremely flavorful and they give you enough to where if you wanted that could be a meal. Don't think I would come back here though."

All the selections you want including alligator, jambalaya, etc. Make sure you go the reservation route as otherwise you'll be standing outside for some time and then wondering when you do get in why you were waiting so long with so many empty tables."
5yqH25a5GAbc3OpUSewC9A,,,It was okay! Not a big fan of oysters. Here EVERYTHING is oyster. I ordered a half poboy sandwich with a cup of gumbo. Really not a fan of gumbo either. My bill was only $14 it was worth it

Grab a to go beverage from another establishment while you wait but be prepared to throw it away when your table is ready.  We sat at the bar and the staff was friendly and quick to get us anything we ordered.  The oysters are the thing so order them grilled or raw they are very good!,
5zte5pldNNUSqj1hxXDWGA,,"It was our last night in New Orleans and we were looking for something to hang on tastebuds on until our return. Winter M., a trip veteran, suggested Acme.  I LOVED this food! 

She did warn us that because of Acme's popularity, there would be a substantial wait. Though, we ended up only waiting for 30 minutes. In a large, fun group. This seemed like only a few minutes and it gave us some time to chum up with the host and pick his brain on menu favorites. Once seated, we were attended to almost immediately. The menu had many options- seafood mostly and even a hamburger which one of our group did order. She gave it a thumbs up. But, over all,  this restaurant is a palace for the southern seafood lover. The charbroiled oysters are covered in butter, cheese and seasonings. The hush puppies make you say, ""yum."" The coleslaw was the perfect amount of sweet and perfect pairing with the oysters to balance the palette. I had a bowl of the seafood gumbo too. I couldn't resist. I was in the south and had to run with it. It's not a cheap meal but it doesn't have to put a dent in the bank account either.  I highly recommend Acme!",

6-adwBBPzRCzE8TgCpdLrQ,,,Kim P was outstanding our server!  She was  very help making sure we got the best of the  menu had.  Will be back next time.
6-fyehsS585GGdd7LZcEbQ,,"I know, I know... come one come all for the world famous chargrilled oysters!!! Hey, they were pretty delicious. Very garlicky, sprinkled with Parmesan, and large, fresh oysters. I'm a fan. 

However, the boo fries stole the show. French fries with extremely tender, shredded beef and smothered with a rich brown gravy and cheese. I will dream about this. So much flavor. 

The po'boy subs were mediocre. All fried seafoods tasted the same, and had too much breading. Would like some cocktail and tarter sauce but had to inconvenience the service to provide. Roll was dry. Waitstaff overall had us feeling pretty rushed. I get that it's a popular spot (consistent line out the door to be seated) but let me enjoy my meal after such a wait. Line didn't take long, around 30 mins average. Would recommend, but definitely wasn't my favorite meal I ate while in NOLA.","Ordered a daily special-- a crispy skinned duck thigh topped with their famous mushroom gravy and craw fish. A side of corn and jambalaya. Really fantastic dish and everything was mighty flavorful. Best jambalaya I've had in town to be honest. Very large restaurant with multiple floors. Service was mediocre and not very helpful when it came to recommendations or beverages, minus a star. Overall would recommend this place though, and they provide 10% off coupons around town."
60DyKYeJgjzI83TWD2RvWA,,,I don't understand why the great reviews of this place. I would compare their quality to a TGIF. Service was excellent but food was BAD. They do open late so that's a one nice thing about it.
60MIXyZ5dOwLFcJla9HJ1A,"My boyfriend and I are visiting Nashville and heard great things about this chicken. We decided to go in for an early dinner. The restaurant itself is a cute little place with most of the seating outside. You go up to a counter to order, but be prepared for a line! We ended up splitting a large white chicken (2 breasts and 2 wings with 2 sides). For our sides we got the mac and cheese and fries. The Mac and cheese has a nice kick of heat to it and a thick creaminess. The fries are sprinkled with a spicy rub and are good. The chicken though is out of this world. We ordered the ""hot"" level and yes, it was hot! After the initial shock of heat, the skin was crispy but the chicken was juicy and delicious. I definitely recommend this place!",,
60okpPXHwEc0VsXR3E1cvA,,,pretty good. red beans and rice here is the best ive had honestly. everything else is great. definitely come if youre on bourbon but dont go out of your way. service is awesome

Coleslaw, greens and blacked eye peas we're all delish and perfect with the spicy meat.  Limited beer selection.  Plenty of water available. A must stop.",,
6146pEBFExDfCvroPAV10Q,The wait is worth it!  Hot fried chicken spice to your taste!  We waited 90 minutes but the fried chicken was some of the best ever!  Prepare to wait but come hungry.  The portions are large!  I couldn't finish my small white mild spice w/two sides! Enjoy!!,,
614QxPJz7joPIvmhE8LKuQ,"My husband and I stopped by here when we were in town visiting family. OMG I fell in love! It is sooo good, we ended up going 3X in one weekend! We got there about 15 minutes before it was open, and there was already a loooong line forming. The chicken is so moist and crispy at the same time. I wish we had Hattie B's out in Cali",,
616rg1PNASXCnULIG1H9eQ,"I have tried Match.com, Tinder, JDate, Black People Meet...nothing worked. I was resigned to the fact that I would never meet true love...until now. Sometimes you just have to do it the old fashioned way. Go out there, pick out a hot chick, get a drink, and get to know them. Really devour all they have to offer.  

We got here around 8:30pm and the line was way out the door.  It's pretty rare to see a long line at a restaurant at that time of night.  That was a good sign the food was going to be special.  Or Burt Reynolds was signing autographs inside.  

I ordered the large white meal(two breasts, two wings, two sides). I only got the medium heat level since we were heading out to the bars right afterwards and I didn't want an active volcano in my stomach. 
The medium offered a little tingle and a lot of flavor.  Overall it was splendiferous.  Hattie B's fried chicken is my spirit animal. I'm certain it came straight out of Yahweh's kitchen.  

For sides I got fries and pimento mac and cheese.  The mac attack was tremendous.  The fries were well seasoned.

We sat facing the line of people. I could see their eyes fill with terror as they watched me eat like a pig at a trough. I didn't care. I go into a zone when eating great food and it gets wild. 

I'm just going to say that if you don't like this place then I hate you.  Simple as that.

Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to hop in the car and drive back to Nashville.  My bride-to-be is waiting for me.",,
61Bxlr3tbJrtxDpiPbybvg,"As a true Nashvillian I don't get the hype, the food is mediocre and the waste is absolutely ridiculous as there are 10+ southern style restaurants with hot chicken within a 3 mile radius with better food and half the wait. 

It's just a tourist spot, if that's what your looking for then this is your spot.",,

The oysters are fresh of course, but they are also huge.  Its fun to watch their pro shuckers at work.  If you're visiting New Orleans, make sure you plan to visit Acme early in your trip.  Grab a seat at the bar, order a half dozen/person, take it the show (shuckering), and thank me later!",

Once I got in, 30 minutes later, the taste of the food was enough of an explanation as to why this place is popular.  I think their Grilled oysters are a drug because they are too good to be real.  Well seasoned and grilled just right.  Also the oyster cutters are friendly and sociable.",

61TCaRD0OQmHbV853PucsA,,"Ummm....why are you reading my review? It's Acme, you don't need to...just go already! GO!!!!

But, if you feel so inclined to know my thoughts I'll give 'em to ya. The key word here is Oyster guys. C'mon it's in their restaurant name, it's what you HAVE to order when you visit! Do they serve other dishes? Yes. Would I buy those other dishes? Depends. Every place here has their specialty, and to me ACME does oysters proud. So that's what I stuck with during my visits - but we did try a few other dishes just to out of curiosity. Yes, was so good the first time I dragged the husby back for round 2 before heading home.

Between the raw oysters and the charbroiled oysters - hands down the charbroiled was the clear winner. I did enjoy the raw though - the flavors were naturally salty so we didn't really  need to add the usual tabasco/lemon combo. And I quite enjoyed their version of cocktail sauce - had a nice kick to it compared to your typical cocktail sauce. But the charbroiled..what can I say? That delicious blend of butter, garlic, and parmesan just calls to me! Ha...so good. So freaking good. Loved having the bread to wipe up all that saucy goodness after each oyster. Seeing your oysters sizzling in that sauce when it's served was the bees-knees y'all! And if you like, try the oyster shooter. They aren't shy on the vodka here!

Tried the peace maker po-boy which is half fried oysters/half fried shrimp. I enjoyed the tabasco mayo kick, but the po-boy itself was just okay compared to other NOLA spots we tried out. I will for sure recommend the fried soft shell crab platter. Mmm mmm they got that seasoning down right! Deeeeeelish.

As for wait times - maybe we got lucky. Both times were during the dinner hour; 5:30 and 6:30. Our wait was no more than 10 minutes each time. It doesn't seem to matter who got their first as they tend to seat based on what's available. So we'd see big groups coming in after us smaller parties of 2 - 4 get seated because they have a whole back room area full of long tables for the groups. Just get in line and someone from Acme comes out every few minutes to get your name on the list.

Service was great both times we dined. There are some tv's at the bar area if you want to catch some games too while dining. And of course the drinks - can't go wrong with a cold Yuengling or Abita Purple Haze to go with your oysters!

Y'know the mantra:

good service + great food = thumbs up ACME!!!",
61rLbqR5Dhxz5TEEPCDNFw,,,Awesome! Tried alligator meat for the first time!!! Open late. Waitress was super nice!!! Come try it if you have not yet.

Tender, large oysters with an amazing butter garlic sauce. (They give you French bread for dipping , yum).  The boom boom shrimp, the seafood étouffée, and seafood gumbo were also a hit. Loved the pecan cobbler as well. 

Be prepared to wait in line ... But it was well worth it!!! First available seating is great if you're a smaller party (they will seat you at the bar or a table). The bartender waitress who served us was super helpful as we were in a rush to get to a show at Harrah's.",

We are not big fans of southern fried food so this cuisine is not our favorite but we wanted to try the authentic flavors.  The gumbo was really great.

Chargrilled oyster are a must try and everything else on the menu we had was good also. We had the chargrilled and charbroiled oysters at a couple of other spots in the French Quarter but these were hands down the best.

Came twice during our stay and will be back during our next visit whenever that is.",

The least they could do was honor the prices that lured us in.",

This 3-story establishment seems to have cemented its way into the mouths and hearts of many French Quarter patrons and tourists, but I am not sure why.  Ok, from that point, I should say I was only looking for non-seafood food.  So, ignore my two cents if you were/are here for the seafood.

What can you get if you don't want seafood?  Pasta.  Meh.  Salad.  Meh.  Fries.  Meh.  Cajun stew.  Meh.  Everything else, you should worry about having seafood and/or meat somewhere in the mix.  So, be aware.  Not the best place for food that is not seafood.  It's the unwanted step-child approach to the veg food here in the sense that they acknowledge a need to have it as part of the menu family to be fair, but doesn't mean they want to really give any time and consideration for these choices.

However, really, the service here is fabulous.  Thanks staff of Oceana.  Impressive attentiveness, politeness, friendliness and efficiency!"

65v7MmcedKNUVbOlKPHdnA,,,I'm a New Orleans local and I don't believe in good Cajun cooking outside of the home but this place proves me wrong every time. Server Chris definitely made the experience worth it. Will continue to visit!!
665YFG3ySLk07BOlyBfvlQ,100% worth the 30 min wait. My lips are still burning. I would fly into Nashville just to visit this place.,,

Due to my schedule, I couldn't try them out during ""off""-hours, so, I waited in line for about 1.25 hours for dinner on a Thursday night and it was WORTH IT. DELICIOUS, JUICY Southern fried chicken with a nice little side of spicy-kick (to your taste). I can only give it 4 stars because I tried to use the online ordering system beforehand and it was time-consuming and not as user friendly as it could have been, especially the possible pick-up times. Also, because of the long wait, I wanted to just enjoy my chicken back at the hotel and when I got there, I noticed there was no ""dipping"" sauce (e.g. blue cheese or honey mustard, etc.) with my order. That extra sauce would have made the chicken perfect. And one final criticism is the use of styrofoam cups; really wish they would avoid such envirnonmentally-unfriendly materials for regular beverages.",,

You have to be comfortable sharing a table with strangers, as most of the seating is at long tables with multiple parties at each. Their po-boy are good, but I say go for the chargrilled oysters!

Well I think we stumbled into it as my family visited Stephen our sublime server. He made great recommendations for my sister who doesn't eat seafood and my niece who was much older then the kids menu, but wanted something off the kids menu. I personally enjoyed my Cajun Pasta which isn't too spicy for those who are afraid of spicy stuff. All in all the variety is great for atmosphere, service, and location."
698q2zdsA2i9fYN1YhX1Xw,"Yeah, all the hype is true with this place.  Tender and juicy chicken and the sides were all GREAT.

It did not disappoint! Well, I should clarify - the Boo Fries did not disappoint. They were delicious! My 11-napkin (maybe it was 10, I can't recall) roast beef po'boy was pretty tasty (though not out of this world) and my boyfriend enjoyed his fried seafood (peacemaker? pacemaker?) po'boy. We also ordered a 1/2 dozen of the famous chargrilled oysters... it was the first time I'd ever had oysters and let's just say that I'm not a fan. They smelled good though, and were covered in cheese, which was enough to make my boyfriend fall in love with them.

The service was great - our waitress was very attentive and friendly. I'd definitely allow my boyfriend to drag me back here.",

Very attentive hostess! Service is super friendly and super fast. The shrimp Po boy is so good... bread is perfect, the shrimp is plump and fried just right. I got these crazy smothered french fries... All I know is it's got crawfish and some yummy gravy. So good.  It shouldn't be noteworthy but even the iced tea is fresh brewed and tasty. I've been to many places lately with gross iced tea.

And someone really knows what they're doing here... Watching them train a new server; she's getting actual feedback. kudos to the ownership/management."

The restaurant staff was absolutely no help whatsoever and downright rude."
6AX4acZZgGCM17gH-uYThw,,,"This was my first time in NOLA and let me say that I'm so happy that my boyfriend picked for us to go to Oceana Grill for lunch! The food was absolutely amazing! The way the food was seasoned to perfection with savory flavors! There menu gives so plenty of variety to choose from. I'm allergic to shellfish and that was a blessing to see many chicken options without losing the essence of experiencing NOLA styled food. Also, it gave Bae a chance to get his seafood, lol! Our gorgeous melanin QUEEN server, Regene, was patience and gave us the run down of what was the best things to try! She was joyous and gave us the experience that we wanted out of NOLA! Thank you for all of your help and we will definitely be back!

COVID 19 PRECAUTIONS: This was very safely executed! There is a waiting list that is practicing social distance and they only take in one group in at a time.
The tables are spaced out comfortably and there are multiple floors to be seated on. I suggest the window view, its fun to people watch in the streets doing foolish things. Mask are required to be wore inside and going to the restroom. You can take them off at your table.

Great vibes, delicious eats, and safe health protection! MY KIND OF PARTY!"
6AtOUMcJxa3B1IXGuPS92A,,,Food was great and our waitress was amazing! I had the Seafood Pasta and he had the Crab cakes. It was sooo much food. For dessert we had the bread pudding and the Banana Foster cake! Both were yummy
6BM9Cxn7OV6PK4BCvXtxbQ,,,Get the secret fries! So good. The red beans and rice is off the chain and the shrimp Poboy was so damn good I kept eating it after I was too full. I went here as a recommendation from the hotel and it didn't disappoint...I recommend sitting at the bar for good people watching.
6BMaadXrnfSO0GC_p8hJ_Q,,,"I've been here on two different vacations and the food has been ok both times. The blackened duck was kind of chewy, but I don't ever eat duck so maybe that is normal? I had the BBQ shrimp based on the reviews and was kind of grossed out by them. Also had a greek salad with chicken that was pretty good. I only came here because it was in Kitchen Nightmares but locals seem to love it. The airport shuttle driver, the front desk person at my hotel, people walking by that could see me looking at the menu from outside - they all love the place and think it's delicious"
6BPMK69rK1UPhcVi_B-q2w,"It's legendary for a reason! Sure, there's a line, but suck it up and enjoy yourself - this is the place to get your Nashville hot chicken. We got two half birds, one Hot and one Very Hot. The Very Hot basically melted my face, be careful if you order this. Seriously - it's not at all for the faint of heart. 

Sides - we got greens, the black eyed pea salad, and the pimento Mac and cheese. Greens were decent (not bad, really, and I'm choosy), black eyed peas were good but unexceptional, and the mac and cheese was delicious. 

Beers were a bit pricy (we got a pitcher), but who the hell cares? They're cold and pretty good for a beer selection, and the place is great. Nicest folks working here, too - swing on through, y'all. You'll be glad you did.",,

Loved the fact that it is right on Bourbon Street so we got to walk to the bars right after a meal (and three rounds of tequila shots..lol). Oysters were fantastic and so was the seafood platter. My friend and I ordered about 4 different items to share and were completely stuffed. Now, there were a couple of complications with our orders, which delayed some people (total of 7 of us) to eat, but as people in the restaurant industry, we understand that sometimes things just do not go as planned. Definitely a restaurant I will consider going back to...AFTER I have tried the rest of the ones with high ratings."

best thing for sure was the soft shell crabs

jambalaya was really good too and normally i do not like it

got the red bean and sausage, not a fan of beans but it was good

the beer was good maybe cause i was a little buzzed already.  got a bowl of corn chowder or something that looked like it, and that was ok

everything in nawlins compared to cali seems to be much cheaper, as in seafood!!!

sooo amazing a have to go!! line is forever, i dont think there are reservations cause it is always so busy, please do not try to cut in line, cause people have tempers, and the hostess will for sure kick you out, with the help of the securiy outside

wait for sure at night will be an least ...LEAST an hour!

go early",

6D5W9DjQ-90Csg6kb7eIOw,,"For a place that's firmly on the tourist trail in NOLA, Acme was surprisingly good.  I hate spending my vacation time (and money, and calories) at dining establishments with long lines and souvenir tees.  Usually, they are overpriced and overrated. Not so with Acme. Yes, there was a line, but it moved fast and the staff was friendly.  They could get away with being rude-- thousands of drunk tourists every day would make us all little snippy, but everyone was cheery.

The raw oysters were good, but not clean-- a good bit of grit and green goop.  I'm sure that its just a volume problem. They churn them our so fast there's no time to get them purged. Otherwise, obviously a high-quality product.
The charbroiled oysters were delish (butter, garlic, cheese-- what's not to love).  Our waitress was superhuman fast and friendly.  Prices are fair, and all varieties of the local brew, Abita, are on tap.  Definitely worth a stop.",
6DTDe6cY4G8TT6rSqJj-hw,,,"I feel bad not giving this place 5 stars because it's been rated so many times, but I have to be honest, I wasn't that impressed with my experience. Our waiter was very polite, but wasn't very attentive. We ordered their Bloody Mary's that are apparently ""the best in town"" and maybe I must've had a new bartender make mine, because I wasn't blown away by it. My fiancé ordered the shrimp po boy and it looked (and tasted) pretty plain. I ordered the fried seafood sampler and it was my definitely fault I wasn't adventurous enough to try something different to be impressed. I also noticed about 30 minutes after we left, my stomach started to gurgle and I felt horrible (I had to basically run to the nearest public bathroom), so I have a feeling the fried oysters weren't necessarily fresh. If you want to have a better experience, I would recommend stepping out of the fried food zone!

One thing I can definitely recommend to try if you decide to come here is the blackened (not fried!)  alligator tail bites. Delicious & worth the money. I probably enjoyed this dish the most out of the entire meal."
6DbGFQoaYEE5lXqie48Hmw,,"We spent awhile in line, but it wasn't too bad.  Good conversation and the line was moving. It was my first time in New Orleans, and it was the moment I set foot there, so I had to get gumbo and etouffee.  The gumbo was good, but the etouffee was delicious! I was really craving it.  The oyster shooter was pure vodka.  I am not a drinker, so I wish they would have added a bit more cocktail sauce in place of it.  However, I'm not complaining.  It was good.  I wish I could have gotten the chargrilled oysters, but unfortunately, I wasn't feeling that great so I didn't want to risk it. Overall, a great place if you don't mind the line.",
6Dca_QIXdvHH3lIHHPcyxw,,"If I've learned anything from traveling, it's that long queues mean the food is worth waiting for. Acme is no exception, but I was caught a little bit off guard by the food. 

I had a gigantic breakfast that morning, so I came to Acme for a late lunch to force myself to eat and not miss a meal while in New Orleans. The line was 20-strong, but I got seated within 20 minutes at the bar. If you're by yourself or have a party smaller than 3, you should definitely sit at the bar - it's great to chat with the shuckers to watch their craft. 

Since I wasn't terribly hungry, I ordered half a dozen chargrilled oysters and a side of red beans and rice. The beans and rice came out first, and I was kind of surprised at how little meat there was in it - I wasn't expecting there to be more meat than beans, but I think there was only 1 meager piece of sausage? Kind of disappointing, but it was still good. 

The oysters are definitely worth it. So much flavor packed on top of the meat, and dipping bread into that garlic butter - divine! One thing that I noticed is that the size of the oysters varied a little more than I would have liked - I got maybe 2 that were huge and looked like they were just shucked, while the rest were medium-sized to being sad, shriveled oysters with an overcoat of cheese to hide their size. 

Acme is an institution, and it's a very well-run one at that. If you can spare to wait, then you might as well try it (it's worth it), but maybe you could also check into other oyster bars for what could be possibly better.",
6DdG2EBAUaT6ZvfYsg-y8A,,,"Any other time of day this might be 3 or 3.5 stars, but a good meal at 11:30pm deserves a star boost.

Server and host were prompt, friendly and attentive. Good find for a late arrival, and recommend trying."

6H0yw-aOLHO2BRkRrNMTsA,,,This was by far my favorite restaurant in New Orleans when I came for Mardi Gras. Great food and outstanding service. Highly recommend it. If you never had your chicken grilled and blackened I strongly suggest you do that.
6HAPBZtfmQWxQpRLvRxn3w,"This was the best stand-alone fried chicken I've ever had. I don't like spicy food, so I just went with the mild option (you could SENSE the heat on some of the hot chicken orders as they wafted by you, though!) but it was divine. The juiciest-on-the-inside-crunchiest-on-the-outside bone-in fried chicken I've eaten. My only complaint (and considering how delicious it was, it's a really small complaint) is that it was a little greasy. But honestly, you could barely tell for how juicy that chicken was anyhow.

Next time, we will definitely order take-out ahead of time instead of standing in the line out the door (and through the parking lot). I didn't catch that suggestion until we were already waiting in line - but it's a good one! Otherwise, you should get there before you start getting hungry. But worth the wait! :)",,

6HrpgvxzmScrWoCE53Cj6Q,"Summary: good chicken, long waiting time

I visited Hattie B's on a Saturday morning at around 11:10am. There were already around 60 people in line outside the building and it took almost an hour to get  inside. After ordering, our food came to us in about 15 minutes.  They have great customer service with really friendly staff. They served really big portions, I ordered the tenders, mild, with two sides of fries. The food was good (8.5 out of 10 in my book), but not worth waiting an hour for. Especially if you haven't eaten that morning yet because the long wait in line leaves too much time to become hangry. My advice, eat a snack before going so you don't get hangry in line, but nothing too big or you won't be able to  finish the big portion served to you.",,

6IRyY1Cnk9snBXcFNlHidw,,,Worst place ever. Worst customer service . My friend ordered a double jack and they gave him a single jack and coke. They tried to tell him that it was a Double. We drink jack and coke every night just about and we know what a double should taste like. The general manager didn't wanna own up to their mistake . Waiter skipped passed us the whole time and did not check on us until it was time for him to bring us our food. Brought table next to us water as a refill but non To us. Place is awful. Wouldn't recommend . General manager isn't worth crap. I am a general manager and treat all of our customers with respect . This guy should def not be a general manager.
6I_vZ-DzDshlL7tP_cjEVg,,"One of the best and least expensive meals I had in New Orleans. My meal consisted of everything New Orleans I wanted to try: oysters, crawfish, po'boy and gumbo. The 1/2 soup 1/2 sandwich option is great, seafood gumbo was bowl-lickin' good. Drowned it down with a few local IPAs. Sat at the bar and met a few other out-of-towners for cocktails later that evening.",
6Idx4fbm1ZLx4sYFltVwxQ,,"Great atmosphere, food and service. ""Community seating"" - means if you're with a party of 6 and the table you're at seats 8, you will have company if they're busy. Wasn't bad though, people are friendly. Oysters on the half were excellent - the cocktail/hot sauce that come with is the best I've tasted. They walk you right by the chargrilled oysters upon seating. Very tempting (someone in my party had them and loved them). All our food was good; poboy, gumbo, jambalaya, fried shrimp, hush puppies, fries - all good. Appetizers came fast, food took almost another 20min--didn't mind as they were busy and the food was worth the wait. 

Also a location in Harrah's casino.",
6IeGk4i1BPl2PS5jWZ5OxA,,"ACME has great oysters, need I say more? No but really, the charbroiled oysters are amazing. They are covered in a sauce you would use on garlic bread and have a great charbroiled taste but still plump and tender inside. The raw oysters were also good, but they bring them out on a plate without ice. It's not a huge problem since we were ravenous and demolished them in about 2 minutes, but I still prefer raw oysters to be crisp and cold. For simple raw oysters, I would skip ACME, no need to wait in line when every other place on the block has the same (but colder) raw oysters. Only bother with that line if your looking for oysters dripping in butter and happiness.",

6JepNVRzCggHY6Lnj2rqjg,,,This was the second time my wife and I have been to Oceana Grill and it is *always a must stop for us when we are in town! The food is phenomenal and prices are reasonable. We have been lucky to have Dominic as our server both times and she is just the sweetest. Really great atmosphere. One of our favorite spots for sure.
6JiAPDRv8Cmbt9J89v1rOQ,,"On a recent trip to New Orleans I visited ACME Oyster.  I thought that it was going to be a tourist trap, but I was wrong.  The food is incredible.  We went for lunch on a Friday around noon.  We had to wait in line, but it moved quickly and we sat at the bar so that reduced our wait time.  We had the char-grilled oyster and they were AMAZING! I had tried the dish at another restaurant, but ACME's is way better! We also ate the crab cake, red beans and rice and the roast beef sandwich.  All delicious! The roast beef sandwich has great flavor! We ended up going back for lunch another day during our trip.",
6K0XgRNkThLW4wAMJtj3Og,"The hype is real. Delicious, crispy, spicy chicken with every bite you want more. I first heard about this place on the show Ugly Delicious (yes, I'm late in the game), and it lived up to every bit of the expectation and hype this place had generated. Hattie B's was one of the main reason why I decided to visit Nashville at all!

As we pulled up in our Uber, of course there's a line out the door. After patiently waiting in line and meeting other tourists about how they heard about this legendary fried chicken place. We were greeted with a simply menu: white vs dark (meat), optional parts (wing, tenders), and spice level. Also ordered a sandwich and sides (Mac cheese, collared greens, baked beans, creamy cole slaw, black eyed pea salad). I didn't try any desserts, but I definitely will need to try next time I'm back in town.

The service was friendly and quick. Although the wait is a bit long, once you order the food comes out relatively fast. I would absolutely recommend as one of the stops in Nashville.",,
6K1MhgARbYnF2Uq771MpnA,,"I'm here for work and last night I spent $31 BY MYSELF at Lüke eating things with blood orange hollandaise sauce and fancy drinks with absinthe. So tonight I wanted a po'boy and a beer. I wanted to make a mess and sit at a bar.

Thanks to Yelp, I found a place to eat a po'boy within walking distance of my hotel. The reviews were right about the line of people and they were also right about it moving quickly.

I was seated at the bar after about 2 minutes of waiting in line. Another guy sat next to me at the same time and he seemed confused. He should have read Yelp! I quickly ordered a half shrimp po'boy with a side of cole slaw. And an Abita- DUH. Then I saw the oyster shooter for $1.49. Cool. I didn't need a plate of raw oysters, just one would be enough- at least so I could try it. I mean, I AM at an oyster bar.

The food came out quick, before my confused neighbor had even decided what to order. It looked perfect. The girl asked if I wanted tartar sauce or cocktail sauce, I said ""Sure, both."" She was like, ""Really?"" I said, ""Sure!"" 

I had no idea what the po'boy would need. I mean, come on.

I ended up adding both, but in hindsight could have done away with the tartar. The cocktail sauce was just like I like it: 80% horseradish. Horseradish is my favorite kind of spicy. I want to not hear what you're saying for a second because I had too much horseradish.Y'all can all keep your jalapeños and habaneros and fire-breathing dishes. I'll take an exploding head ANY DAY over having to keep my toilet paper in the freezer.

So the food was great, but not mindblowing. The bread was just right, the cole slaw was decent cole slaw. I'm taking away a star because the fried shrimp- while delicious- were small, like salad shrimp. My neighbor ended up ordering a fried platter and his shrimp would have been AWESOME on my po'boy, IMHO.

What about the oyster shooter, you're saying? I know! Well, I thought it would be a single oyster on a cracker with fixins. Nope. they brought me a tiny plastic cup with an oyster sitting in some cocktail sauce and some liquid. I smelled it, no smell.

""Um, excuse me, what's in this? Besides the oyster?""

""Vodka. And cocktail sauce.""

Oh. Not what I was counting on. But it's my new favorite way to drink vodka, y'all!

So go. Order some oysters (while you still can) and have fun. Don't be intimidated by the line. If you sit at the bar and mention the oil spill (that's you, drunk dude sitting next to me) you get to hear the oyster-shucker launch into a good-natured diatribe about Big Oil corruption, government corruption, fishing regulation, poverty, Bush, Obama, Israel, his mom, Katrina and his new-to-him boat. 

What. It's New Orleans. You just wanted a po'boy?",
6K1nJqKYvMYDedr8oLfZlQ,"BEST FRIED CHICKEN I'VE HAD SO FAR! 

I came to Hattie's with my family of 6, got here at 12:15pm on a Sunday afternoon. We waited proximity 15 mins to order our food. We ordered 1 Large Dark Plate (Medium), 1 Large Dark plate (Hot) with waffles, two tenders and two wings. We ordered mac&cheese, baked beans, cole slaw, and grits with bacon. 

THE DOWNSIDE. Our food took 40 mins to come out. We didn't get our food til 1:10pm. 

But once the food came out, GAME OVER! I had the HOT Dark meat, and man it was tasty! The chicken was spiced just right, and the meat was juicy and tender. Nothing that I've tasted before. I'm from Seattle, and we have Ezell's chicken (The one Oprah ships to Chicago), and I feel this place beats Ezell's by miles! 

Sides I could have gone without, should have just eaten their chicken to be done with it.",,
6K9LS7-XRxL1dsqB3EzACA,,"Okay, I waited in line for probably twenty minutes to get in. The line was almost to the end of the block but seemed to move fairly quickly. Coming from Toronto, a city that loves lining up for trendy destinations, I was hesitant, and tempted by the numerous half-empty oyster bars across the street, but the wait was not too long and we were happy to see what the hype was about.

My partner and I ordered a fairly extensive selection of items, including raw oysters, chargrilled oysters, a shrimp and oyster po'boy, and a soup we can't recall, in addition to drinks.

The service is fast and enthusiastic, and the whole experience is a bit zany. This is a high volume place, and the speed and noise level of the restaurant is a part of the experience. I'm a big oyster fan, but am more accustomed to the Toronto-mode of the  $3 oyster with a regional designation. I was a bit surprised to see the oysters arriving uncleaned, with dirt and smaller sea-creatures still clinging to them, but I was not disappointed by their quality for the price. The oysters were all quite large and well-shucked, and the chargrilled oysters were delicious and very indulgent. The food was consistently good, if not exceptional, but it really is about the experience here. This place is a destination, and it is a lot of fun.",
6L-VcXwxYtXjmyKKRTNLkA,,"This place gets busy so arrive early.

We were seated quickly however the place was already packef. Ordered drinks and food that arrived quickly and our server was great.

Food was good, but didn't blow me away.  They clear down quickly which is Ok as the turnover is high.

As we left there was a serious Q.",
6L6DwsUVxwYYsi7YPdHzMQ,,,"It's a little tricky to find this place. You can reach it from bourbon or royal as you go around the construction. Google is pretty accurate about the busy times. I went right around 6:30 for dinner and it started to get busy soon after. The food is excellent. I got an order of crab cakes, a small crawfish etouffee and a bread pudding. Everything was delicious and a great intro to my first meal in New Orleans. The bartender was friendly and attentive and the drinks were strong.
When in New Orleans, go here for a meal. It's worth it."
6L6_Mjw7Ilu9CW_43_5_XA,,,Unfortunately I was not impressed with this place at all. We were recommended this place by a few locals and it did not deliver as promised. I really wanted a good steak and I should've listened to my instincts and went to an actual steak house. But there were some positives like the drinks and the gator bites which were really good. This place is also located off of bourbon in the French quarter so it does get pretty busy.
6LuhfhUCeD8WJGpKbL8RNw,"Wow- was skeptical of this tourist favorite but chicken was so good, fried perfectly, seasoned well, and just melted in your mouth. Sides were delish too. So yes, line was out the door but folks move through quickly that grabbing a table after ordering at the counter was surprisingly quick.",,
6LwQb-JbVIaGQAzt3MCgPw,,,"The place looks small initially but then I realized there's more seating on the other end. I was in where the oysters chef was located. Their signature oysters was phenomenal. No sand at all. Nothing but smooth yumminess. If it wasn't so pricey I would order more. 

The grilled fish was also good. My son had the fried catfish and it was tender and juicy too. Service was fast. The waitress made a mistake on the bill but she quickly rectified it. If you check in via yelp, they give you a 10% off the bill.

By the way, my kid noted that this restaurant was in Kitchen from Hell or Hell's Kitchen. So Gordon Ramsey was there back in 2011 or something. At first my initial thought was ewww. But then if Gordon Ramsey came and gave them advice then it should be great! It's pretty good food. I would come back if I'm ever in New Orleans again."
6M2MSTwwGTQ4cUGKjJjdwQ,,,Decent food and service. Long line to get in that moved quickly. The dock was way better than expected!!
6M3MWlfsDgLUKPWMHAyiKg,,,"A MUST!!!! You have to eat here! I'm gonna get to the point! It was EVERYTHING AND MORE!!! 
 We came here for my sisters birthday, the fact that they are open late! From the time we walked in the staff was friendly and welcoming! It was clean and didn't smell like a seafood restaurant which is a plus! The dinning area an bar were full of cheerful buzz and smiling staff! Everyone from the bus boy welcomed us! 
We were seated with Chris! he gladly welcomed us and explained the menu, we wanted everything! 

Appetizer: BBQ Shrimp Goodness! I had never had New Orleans style BBQ sauce.. ""Pascal Manale"" it was full of flavor rosemary and butter, garlic & worcester sauce. It comes with three slices of French bread, great for dipping! The shrimp are JUMBO!! 

Entree: Shrimp Alfredo with blackened shrimp ! I'm not a big fan of shrimp Alfredo but after reading the menu I had to try it, and I'm glad I did! I had a bowl of noodles cooked just right, smothered in cajun Alfredo sauce! The flavor in every bite equaled a party in my mouth! My goodness it wasn't spicy in heat it was spicy in flavor. The rich creamy sauce was married beautifully with the Alfredo! I even asked for an extra side of Alfredo"" says the I don't care for Alfredo girl""!!! 

Dessert: SAVE ROOM!!! 
After a few deep breaths we made room for the bread pudding! Goodness!  It came in the shape of a big muffin with caramel, chocolate sauce,& whipped cream! At first I was reluctant because bread pudding can either be good or bad.. This was AMAZING! It was browned perfectly which made for a great crust in the outside especially seeing as how you have Carmel and chocolate sauce! As I said earlier bread pudding can be mushy either good or bad.. an this WAS NOT THE CASE! The first bite tasted heavenly! The crust in the outside with the Carmel, chocolate Combo wonderful butter flavor!!! My goodness!!! Part of me wished I had ordered desert first!! 

While we were eating the staff was friendly everyone that walked by wished  my sister happy birthday! I thought it was just cause she had all the birthday flare on, but they were just as friendly to the other tables! That let me know that they want you to feel at home, they want you to feel welcomed and comfortable! The waiter Chris was awesome I know who I will be askin for next time I come in. We also had the please of meet the manager Daniel was amazing!  He took a minute to stop by and ask us how we're doing,& wish my sister a HBD! I had to took this opportunity to let him know that is his staff is awesome! They know how to provide great Hospitality from beginning to end! He was so warm and humble he quickly recognized his staff for doing a great job! That is not something you see often! Shout out to him! 

All in all THIS IS A MUST!! I plan on becoming a regular/ whenever I am in town!! I look forward to bringing my friends,& family!!!"
6MbTr5OJNKz1wv-8ocuWOg,,"Wow-wee.....really a great spot for oysters. Holy cow they were goooood! Everyone is right, there is a line but it does move quick. We went on a Friday night around 5:45 and there was a few groups in front of ours, but about 20 minutes and we were in the door (the line behind us was stacking up fast and people kept coming!). Place is pretty small but the staff was prompt and attentive! Put in our order for chargrilled oysters and some gravy fries and felt like minutes later they were back with our apps. Both where awesome! The chargrilled oysters were definitely the bomb. I think they sprinkle crack on them. 

We had picky teenagers with us and even they ate the oysters and we had to fight them for the last couple. It was loads of fun. We ordered po-boy, beans and rice, bread bowl and gumbo. Everything was okay but doesn't measure up to the oysters. We'd go back for the apps, oysters and beer, but the rest of the food was just ok. 

We were in from out of town and tried several oyster spots before going here. Well worth the wait but you must get the chargrilled oysters. You have better options for entrees but overall we were glad to find this spot.",
6MjiY7G4tNrNlQ1-k20z2w,,"I was down in New Orleans for the Super Bowl and looking for a good place to eat.  See a lot of recommendations for this place so I stopped by for a late dinner on my first night in New Orleans.

The line wasn't too bad around 10pm and we were seated after 10 minutes. Now, I normally like my oysters raw. But I want to try something different so I ordered a dozen Chargrill oysters and craw puppies for appertizer.  The Oysters are super plumps and juicy.  The Best I ever had anywhere.  For entree, I ordered the Peacemaker PoBoy.  It's also amazingly good.  But next time when I'm back in town, I will just eat the Oysters all day. 

The place is loud though so you will need to talk loud.  But other than that, a great place to eat.",
6Msz92Gq0Tr8lR9e6m9nNQ,"Believe the hype on this restaurant. My daughter and I stopped here on our cross country road trip after reading reviews on Yelp before we arrived in Nashville. We arrived around 4pm and there was already a line in front of the building. We stood in line for 30 minutes, an expectation we already had, was it worth the wait!!!!  She got the mild tenders with Mac and cheese and the greens. She loved it!  I got the medium small white meal (breast and wing) with fries and Mac and cheese. The one thing we forgot was the dressing, but the quickly brought it out and it was great. Stop at Hattie B's when in Nashville.",,
6MvVDFQ-uL_2gGF9G8g5Xw,,,"This place is awesome! The staff was really friendly, our waiter Shahan was super knowledgeable about the menu and helped us make some GREAT choices! We started with the oysters, and also had the Gator Bites, both blackened and fried. Both of those were amazing! I had the crab cakes, I totally know now why they are known for those. The sauce was this mushroom sauce and it was sooo wonderful with the spices in the cakes! My partner had the special for the night, crawfish and red fish. The greens were tasty! We ordered Hurricanes to go and they had dry ice in them and that made them super cute! This place has a great NOLA feel without being over the top!"
6MzE12HMoqCe3I97tvMD2w,Great Place! Great Chicken Sandwich! We got a pitcher of beer and it was the last of the keg and they gave us a new pitcher with what we had! Come! Eat! And Be Satisfied!,,
6N9TkSJ08BhADzZJ0LGkDg,"Okay - if you are in Nashville and you are adventurist enough to go for some famous hot chicken I would say check this place out.  I've watched so many celebrity chefs visit Nashville for this local favorite and found it hard to chose between Hattie B's, Prince's or Bolton's...
Luckily this place was just down the street from our hotel.  It was 22 degrees out and we braved the weather along with many others in line.  The locals were super friendly and provided plenty of advise as TRUST me - you will want to take notes as this stuff can ""mess you up!""

I had the small portion of dark meat - a leg and thigh with mild spice.  The meat was so juicy and the skin crispy.  Heat got me sweating and when it's 22 degrees outside - it was a welcome heat... The pitcher of beer didn't quench my thirst but the pimento mac & cheese helped a bit.  After the mild I ventured onto a chick tender with medium spice. The tender was ""Yuge"" and perfectly fried.  At this point - everything was hot and I was swiping my brow, dome and neck with paper towels.  I would come back but with a strategy; order a chicken tender ($1.50) for each of their spices levels so I can at least give it a try.
Also - there were many regulars who ordered ahead and picked up which was a smart idea on a cold day! 

Lesson learned.",,
6NBJprU8lxCbiR8Y0wp-Vw,"Hattie B's is a fun restaurant to visit when you're in Nashville.  I enjoyed the chicken tenders (medium hotness) with the pimento mac and cheese and the baked beans.  The Mac and Cheese and Beans were a highlight.  My group got a lot of different things, all prepared on different levels of ""hot"".  The hottest of all is a lot to handle, so be prepared!  On the first bite, you won't think it's that strong, but after a few seconds, you will feel it!  

Before planning your visit, keep in mind that you will most likely have to stand in line.  We visited at 2:30 on a Monday, and our wait was approximately 40 minutes.  Once you get in, the ordering process was easy, and we didn't have any trouble finding a table.  

Hattie B's is a place to check out on your next visit to Nashville!",,
6NFYX5KenG0foRIu7rlMYg,,,Nice atmosphere. Best greeter. Great food. I recommend the alligator appetizers and the Taste of New Orleans plate. It's a busy side of town and we had to wait to be placed but it was worth it.

6NjgZcFBw-m24WWbqBuOpg,"Got the Southern style Chicken and it was my first real experience with southern fried. It was crispy hot and very tender due to the fact that they brine it before they batter and fry it. The fact that I don't eat spicy foods makes my review unimportant as the restaurant is known for ""hot chicken"". My friends just loved it and it was finger licking good. Sides were great especially the black eye peas, greens and beans. Authentic local Nashville dish in every way.",,
6Nr1pTzBpP1F3u_dqwQJiA,,,"The food was great and the prices were very reasonable. The location is convenient - Conti & Bourbon. The building is multiple levels and is much larger than it looks from the street, the atmosphere is desirable as well."

It's a good thing I had this on a Wednesday night otherwise if I said it was as good or better than my local pubs Friday Night Fish Fry I might not be welcomed back home. 5 star food and waitress Taylor. Minus one for women's restroom cleanliness, according to my wife."

I had one of the recommended specials that was not on the menu & it did not disappoint!!! Blackened Red fish on top of cornbread dressing, topped with shrimp & a side of greens! Soooo good!

I did get to meet George Stephanopoulos there around the Katrina anniversary in 2006, so the touristy part isn't all bad.  Very good food.",
6PAPUrtKdjhkEbnMxAW-gg,,"This was my favorite oyster spot in New Orleans! It's not just hype, and it is worth the wait in line. We got the fresh shucked oysters as well as the chargrilled ones, and I usually don't like cooked oysters of any kind, but these were tasteful and not briny at all. They came with a savory sauce with bread on the side to mop up all the sauce you missed. 

Also got a po'boy and fried soft shell crab platter. The crab was yummy, but it's not something you can eat a whole lot of. You get tired of the taste quickly, so make sure it's a shared plate. The po'boy was also quite delicious and came out in a huge portion! 

Feel free to order a few things, then order some more after gauging how full you are. 

Better for smaller groups for faster seating, and if you are okay with sitting at the bar, it is faster.",

The hot chicken here is so so so good and the staff is nearly as great. We showed up right aftet 11:00 am on a Saturday and there was a line out the door. The wait ended being approximately an hour and a half. There are water stationa along the way if you get thirsty...either from the heat of the sun or from all the drooling that is going on. 

Once you get in the door, it's time to order. The staff is extremely friendly and will answer any questions you have.

I went with the half dark meat chicken (mild) with fries and pimento mac and cheese. The chicken was crispy on the outside and oh so juicy inside. Easily the best fried chicken I have ever eaten before. There wasn't a single part that was dry. 

The fries were of the crinkle variety and they were also nice and crispy. It was obvious they were fresh out of the fryer. The pimento mac and cheese was so creamy and cheesy, it was amazing.

We ended up sitting inside right by the cashier and order area. We watched the staff interacting with customers and they were all so friendly and helpful.

If you are in Nashville, absolutely stop by. Don't let the line scare you, you will be thankful you waited.",,
6RTQivkJMgWHXktNly-urg,"Man oh man, this place has officially ruined fried chicken for me. Now, whenever I go someplace and eat fried chicken, I'm pretty much never wowed because the bar's been set too freaking high. It's a simultaneous ""thank you, Hattie B's!"" and ""damn you, Hattie B's!"" that's gone through my head after nearly every fried chicken experience thereafter (save for maybe Bonchon, but even though they're both fried chicken, they're kind of apples and oranges if you ask me because Bonchon-level super-fried chicken is a monster all on its own).

Basically, if you live in Nashville and haven't been, you're missing out, and if you don't live in the area - all the more reason to check it out while you still can. Your taste buds will thank you! Not to mention so will your wallet - it's a hell of a good deal, especially if you get one of the bigger orders that comes at a discount. The chicken's perfectly tender and crispy and flavorful in all the right places. And the sides are pretty good too, though they're understandably overshadowed by the main attraction.

I ate so much (despite knowing I could take it home - aka it was pure and utter greed that kept me going bite after bite) that I forfeited dessert that night (a VERY rare occasion, I assure you). I will say though that it's much, much better fresh (but then again, that probably goes without saying). There's also nothing too special about the atmosphere (very fast-foody/casual), and I've heard there's a pretty long line at times (my friend and I got lucky when we went and didn't have to wait long, thankfully), but again, if you're really craving some good ol' fried chicken, it'll most likely be worth it.",,

6TssoFMmuni-TgsiIgKDzA,,"Came here during my adventures in NOLA.  A few friends back home (NorCal) told me to come by here and have the fried oysters, so I said OOOOOOO-tay.

Came by for lunch one day, and had to wait a little while (line out the door), but it was worth it.

Once seated, we ordered a dozen each of fried and fresh oysters.  I'd never eaten oysters before, and fresh oysters just didn't appeal to me, so I stuck with the fried.  They definitely lived up to the hype.  Super good.  I coulda ate those all day.  The garlic cheese seasoning they cook them in was perfect.

Also ordered the jambalaya and seafood gumbo.  Those were just meh.  Very average.  My grandmother made better gumbo.

Oysters is 5 star.  Gumbo is 3 stars.  so average it out to 4 stars.",
6Ud4fG3qelcBvhUrJyR2ow,"Nashville hot chicken YUM! I ordered the 4/5 hotness and should have ordered the 5-""what the cluck""hot. The 4 ""damn hot"" was still really, really good. This is really a 5 star review but 4 stars only because of the extreme casual, super loud atmosphere. The line is out the door but worth the wait. Plus the people in Nashville are so friendly, the time flies by! Oh-PS-If you are a wine drinker--no wine--just beer. Still a top notch local flavor experience!!!",,
6UnFUhOuHUCmDUAXrCu2lw,,,Super yummy food. I had Paw Paws breakfast which included corned beef hash and poached eggs. Delicious!  Coffee is superb. A great way to start my morning!
6UzZEqF8Atd1pMu0YbKkqg,"Good southern chicken. We safely ate with a peanut & tree nut allergy. Be prepared, it's busy. We opted for carry out. Dined in our hotel room. Hattie B's was less than a block walking.",,
6V22DZY5V32GFzMOIffq7Q,,,"I'll start by saying that the service here was great and I came with a large party. The 2 stars come from the food. I started with gumbo which was tasty but could have a had a bit more spice. My entree (maybe this is my fault for ordering this) was a shrimp/oyster po-boy. The shrimp were fried so hard that I could barely bite them and while I understand that French bread is not the softest, this bread was darn near inedible. I just settled for eating the inside of the sandwich and my fries which had to be taken back bc they were cold. I just wish the food matched the service."
6VAR1gZYrQYk8AiB1luQHQ,So visited on NFL draft weekend. I don't know if the lines are always like this but we didn't have to wait to long and it was truly worth the wait. Chicken was finger licking and I loved the sweet/lemonade mix. I enjoyed every ounce of my meal.,,
6VGc_1stJa6Rpq875QRHoA,,,"Ah-mazing! Came here very late night (or we could say very early morning) after a concert and, I won't lie, I had very low expectations. I thought it was going to be a tourist trap. Wow, was I surprised. The food was incredible! I'd give Oceana Grill five stars if the service wasn't so slow. 

I had the crawfish etouffee. Holy moly! I'm now a diehard etouffee lover! It was so flavorful and hearty. I'm so glad I split it with my girlfriend or else I would have had to be rolled out of there. My husband, who is not a fish lover, thought it was so delicious too. He said he would order it next time. 

The hubs got the blackened chicken poboy. Again, another winner! The chicken was soft, packed with spice and one of the best sandwiches he'd ever have. Since then, he has challenged me to learn how to make their poboys so I can make them at home. Ha! 

Yes, the service was slow but I must say how incredibly generous they were to let us in right before closing. On the contrary to that, we picked Oceana Grill thinking if they were closing that they'd be faster. Sadly, we were very wrong. Oh well... it was totally worth it. 

I must point out our waiter. He was courteous and entertaining. He was apologetic for the kitchen's lag time and accidentally sending out the wrong dish for my friend. We know it wasn't his fault yet he took ownership showing great professionalism and customer service. 

We will definitely be back. And, hopefully next time, I can leave five stars!"
6VPuGSZ4-lYw_Ts7hCTwVw,,,So so good. Came all the way from New York & stumbled upon this place experienced amazing customer service & amazing food. The food was so good I visited 3 times during my 4 day stay in New Orleans.
6VYZ1fjFLkDmgPj6dbUJYg,,,Pasta looked and smelled amazing. I ordered a meal with no onions ( I'm allergic). And they definitely put tiny onions in the dish. The server was very polite and he replaced my order within 5-10 minutes. I would give them a higher rating but an allergy mistake can be life threatening.

6VjRz34Ix-vIE-oOnHBiAA,,"The first time i tried to come here there was a line.  The second time i stopped by at 2pm, we got seated right away.  Score!  Their chargrilled oysters is everything dreams are made of!  I thought about these oysters for days and when i finally was able to get my hands on them...i was the happiest girl in the world! And when there were no more oysters left, i was frantically moping up the oyster juice mixed with butter, cheese, & garlic sauce with whatever pieces of bread that was left.  I totally thought Acme chargrilled oysters were better than Felix across the street.  The jambalaya was bomb too.  Next time when i visit Acme, i want to try everything!",
6WOTfEMVbE3Yudr7DhfkSw,,"Amazing oysters worth the long wait. They have other foods too, but why would you order those?",
6WSKtJBe-jCTrZQ0b4uweQ,,,"The only reason why I didn't have such a great experience here is because we ate at another restaurant for lunch that appears to be the same restaurant. However, the food was still good, but a bit pricey for what you are actually getting. The food isn't bad, but it's nothing special. 

Service was decent and our food came quick. Our group of 7 was in and out in about an hour. The restaurant is big, so there's tons of seating, but it's also so big that service could be a little rough. 

All in all, with all the other options around, I'd pick something else for dinner. If you're looking for lunch though, this place is great."
6Wd9Hf2uKELJXA0Zic69GQ,First time here. Tried to order online. Unable to do so. Long slow lines with onsite ordering. Very small. Mild chicken was actually very hot. Can't imagine what the other levels are like. Avoid peach cobbler. Banana pudding had pieces rather than slices of banana  and very sweet. Greens were good.,,
6WucNpb6w3COiGLD98AngQ,,,Enjoyed our food and the great service. Bridget was wonderful!!! I would recommend this lace to anyone visiting. Not my last time here!!
6XGsuDtD7f3_C2jyj2Ky1g,If you don't go at the right time you will be waiting for 30+minutes. The chicken there is great and the meal plate is plenty of food. It is slow sometimes once u sit down waiting for your food. Is it worth the wait? No. but if you catch them at a good time I recommend it.,,
6XHXP_VojZ3HsAEV7sEpjA,,,The atmosphere and the food was amazing.  Our service was a little bit slow but overall it was a great restaurant to eat at.
6XtbybS_yfOGXW-kLV1PKg,,"Great place for oysters and seafood while in New Orleans. Blackened oysters and house gumbo were delicious. Be sure to stop by the big grill and watch the chefs cook. When we visited there was a line outside, but worth the short wait.",
6Y2CVyuM_L-vvDfvHFXsbA,"Is it a chain? Yes. Is it still delicious chicken? Absolutely. 

Wanted some convenient hot chicken while passing through Nashville and Hattie b's hit the nail on the head. The app made takeout a breeze, and we thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of sides we picked. 

The app being takeout only may bother some, but we were exhausted and could only muster ourselves for a hotel dine in experience anyway.",,
6Y5gPIs64aaMs8riW86GVQ,"Love this place! The line was long but it went by fast since they let you get a drink and wait in line. I sipped on my hard tea and chatted with friends and in no time we were  at the front of the line. I ordered the hot chicken sandwich with macaroni and cheese, it was delicious! I have peach cobbler for dessert - can't wait to enjoy it later. 
IM STUFFED!",,
6YLsfUMEnAwAqcwLxuJ7Vw,,Have visited every trip to NOLA. I love the food but definitely appreciate the service! All the guys shucking were great! Sometimes it's a pretty long wait but it's worth it once you get in.,
6YS4cq20tdECFDfLtDy9HQ,,,"The food was okay but not anything to rave about. Oysters Rockefeller was average, the crab cakes were a bit better as they were fried perfectly. My husbands food came out more than five minutes before mine which is a MAJOR NO NO in my book. He sat waiting for my meal to arrive while his grew cold. There are too many restaurants in the city that deliver excellent service to put up with anything less. The staff was friendly but could have been a lot more attentive. The table was very unstable and jammed into a corner with the next table right on top of us. The building was extremely interesting and was the best part of the visit. I probably will not be back and will opt for a more customer centered establishment on my next visit to the city."
6YbU4Gvc_P_IcAoeV_Nihg,,"This place all the food was delicious it just took extremely long for us to eat our food. The oysters were amazing, I loved the cheese that they put on top. Also the fried catfish and the Po Boy sandwich were really good as well! Other than taking forever to get our food, it was good.",
6Zi9miGFgheFfCCtbnu2uQ,,,"No bueno!!! This is very much a tourist spot....and because of location, I probably should have known better. But...we tried it anyway. 
Im sure tourists love the bland/watered down creole menu but I was quite disappointed. Hate to give bad reviews but I wont be back."
6ZrKtUGiFaDFYfUugRoNvw,"We arrived on a Monday, around 5:45pm. Already had a line out the door. When we got to the register, it took 2 minutes to order, pay, and move on down the line. We got our drinks, found seating outside with no problem and looked up to see the line triple in length. We were there 40 minutes enjoying our food, which by the way was wonderful. We never felt rushed by the staff to hurry and leave. It was a very casual atmosphere and we enjoyed every minute.",,
6_88srspViJ_BcUhwD5TAg,,,"Service first of all was amazing!  I ordered the jazzy crab cakes with sides. My stomach never felt so happy. This is a great example of comfort food. It was savory with zing of spice, flavorful greens, and what I would expect from good old fashion Louisiana  food and hospitality. Come on through!"
6_N3ftM2ZI-Jf_v67CyMUw,,"I don't suggest coming to acme for a full meal.  There are places to go that have much better food.  I do suggest starting your night off here with some grilled oysters.  I didn't not like the raw oysters here at all.  I love raw oysters but apparently I do not like raw oysters from the gulf.  They frankly were too big for me and lacked the ocean taste I love oysters for.  I knew I preferred north east coast oysters over west coast but I was a little surprised how much I disliked these raw ones.  But that was ok the grilled oysters here are worth coming again and again.


We started off with a half dozen grilled and a half dozen raw.  We were so blown away by the grilled that we ordered another 6.  We had dinner plans after but we knew these were too good to pass up.  They coming with a sizzling butter/garlic/cheese sauce that is amazing.  Luckily they provide bread to dip into the left over greasy mess and dip I did.",
6_P0geYrj0BieGTdnvkCaw,,"We came here after 930 so there wasn't a line despite a Saints game going on.  You can't really park around here but you can use a garage.  I'd recommend walking or taking a cab here though.  

We ordered some raw oysters and chargrilled oysters.  The raw oysters are pretty juicy but not briny unlike West coast or East coast ones.  I wish they left a little more liquor in the shells for me to slurp.  The chargrilled oysters are really good.  Nice cheese and butter taste along with some french bread to soak up some of the herbs.  We also ordered some sides and the hush puppies were well made and fried to a good crisp.  The red beans and rice were solid and not salty.  The jambalaya was a bit salty for my taste but the roux was quite rich in a good way.  The waitress recommended soft shell crab and that is something never to be skipped.  As many others have mentioned before, it's still a very solid place for great oysters and get a feel for New Orleans.",
6_VZC1O_WcmoEg54M-hCFQ,,,"Very good meal even with takeout. In the heart of the quarter right off Bourbon St.

Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - highlight of the meal in my mind. recommend ordering, flavorful yet not too heavy
Crawfish Etouffee - very good, full of flavor yet not too salty
Red Beans and Rice - very good, full of flavor. beans were well-cooked yet not too soft
Gumbo - pretty good, generous with the ingredients but flavor is lacking
Crabmeat Cakes - they were okay... nothing to sneeze about
Chargrilled oysters - not even close to as good as Drago's.. would not recommend ordering here"
6_jHwT3No2ql1CF8gf4aeg,,,Mary was the best! She suggested all the classic things to try. Really enjoyed my experience
6_nJ4OlsZIjgGK1JuhwGLg,,,Excellent food and service. A great atmosphere and one of the most friendliest places I have come across. My waitress Pamela was funny and charismatic.

But the dessert was the bread pudding one of the guys that worked there recommended and it was amazing !!!!!

6a8Z84z-VdQEEATehrk9Kg,,,The wait to enter was extremely long. However we waited no longer than 15 minutes to get a table. The establishment is extremely busy (wasn't bothered because it's NOLA and a well know restaurant). Our waitress nice and explained the menu to us. THE CRAB CAKES WERE DELICIOUS!! Wasn't a fan of the gumbo and sautéed vegetables I feel as though it wasn't seasoned enough. Enjoyed my entree with the taste of New Orleans.
6agyPeHb5II3828dtOOJWw,,,"Great, fabulous restaurant. We went on a busy Saturday night and waited in line for only about 10 minutes as we were a table of 2 and were seated on the second floor with a window table. We ordered the Taste of New Orleans with Grilled Crawfish and Crawfish Etouffee. The Taste of New Orleans comes with a sampler of creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans and a bowl of rice with smoked sausage. These were perfect dishes to have to know what the food experience of Orleans is. Our waiter Tracy was great and very helpful even though she was super busy. We will return the next time we back in NOLA!"

6bEr_YXiiIHuQBGHeqiyoA,,,"Wow, so disappointed. We started with appetizers which were only warm and that was the best thing about them. The BBQ shrimp was over cooked and you got 5 shrimp for 12 bucks. The crab cakes were better but were more breading than crab. Our drinks were super weak and after 5 drinks and 6 appetizers we spent over a hundred bucks. Left there and went back to the Hyatt. Way more expensive but but great drinks and food."

A shrimp and oyster po boy, the bread was nice and fresh and the seafood cooked well.  However we also ordered some chargrilled oysters and that's where it got bad.  Apparently oysters are spawning right now, and if you have ever eaten a spawning oyster, you know what I'm talking about when I say it is probably one of the worse things to ever have in your mouth.   Completely turned me off from eating the rest of the oysters and will probably not ever return there, a good oyster shucker should be able to tell a spawning oyster and not serve it.  Bleck.",

The fries with my poboy were seasoned really well and were really tasty, the fish was cooked perfectly and the bread was pretty good. My friend enjoyed her fish, collard greens, and jambalaya. This place has a fun atmosphere, I would recommend it for groups or tourists."
6cAq7olmA_C0bnzt3HmoAQ,,"I would like to review the food but we never actually got in because the organization of seating was so bad. 
You get in line before you put your name on the list. But once we got to the front, our name on the list and all, we were passed up for over 90 minutes in the rain by parties our size and larger. Go to Deenies down the street instead!","Amazing vegetarian stew. Flavorful, filling. Partner ate shrimp Po-boy; was dry but tasty."
6cBZYz36SYI1g0cYBYsteA,,"My party of 4 and I decided to stop by for dinner around 6:30pm. The line was ridiculously long - but it moved super quickly. Don't be overwhelmed by the long line of people. We waited in line for about 20-30 minutes, so it wasn't too bad.
Once seated, we were helped pretty quickly! We decided to split a bunch of stuff. We started off with a half dozen chargrilled oysters. After the first bite of the oyster, we all looked at each other and knew we messed up...we should have gotten the dozen. So we ended up getting another 6! YES, they're that good. Hands down, if you come here and don't get the oysters: what. are. you. doing. Trust me! The dozen oysters came out to $20.
We also split 3 appetizers: Boo Fries ($5), Boom Boom Shrimp ($11), and Crab Cake with Corn Maque Choux ($11). The Boo Fries were good and the Boom Boom Shrimp is great too. The Crab Cake  was okay, in my opinion; I wasn't a huge fan personally.
For entrees, we split the Seafood Étouffée ($9) and New Orleans Medley ($13). The seafood étouffée really surprised me. It was super delicious and filled with flavor. The New Orleans Medley kind of fell short in terms of flavor.
All in all, I really enjoyed the seafood here. The chargrilled oysters are a 5/5 and if this review was just based off of that, I would have thrown in that 5th star. Amazing food; worth the wait!","When in NOLA - try the gator! A friend and I were walking around the area and after a quick Yelp search, we were on our way here to try some alligator!
It was about 2pm; there was no wait at all, so we were seated right away. My friend and I were both pretty full but we definitely didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to try some alligator bites!
We got the Alligator Bites - half fried and half blackened ($13). After about 10 minutes or so, they were at our table.
Honestly, it tastes like chewier chicken, but it was great! I enjoyed the fried alligator more than the blackened, so I'd definitely do that one only next time.
They're known for their seafood here, so if you're in the mood for seafood, definitely keep their place on your radar!"
6ce1NSAUt1Kr7efrLI8XQA,,"It was our last day in New Orleans so we decided to grab a late lunch before heading to airport. The reviews looked great which is why we decided to wait outside in line. After walking past it several times they seem to always have a line. The wait really was not bad we had around ten people ahead of us and we waited 15 or so minutes. 

The inside is a decent size with tables in two separate dining areas and a small bar. Our server greeted us right away and took our drink orders. We started with the grilled oysters with garlic, oil and Parmesan cheese.  The oysters were quite tasty and fresh. I guess due to the cheese they were a bit dry. They could have used more oil. 

Then we had to try the boo fries topped with slow roasted beef. Oh they were delicious. Far from healthy lol but very good. 

We all ordered various entree's and seeing how this is not a very healthy city for food I had the fried shrimp. It seems almost everything is fried here. My shrimp came with hush puppies and fries. The shrimp were ok, good portion and fresh but nothing special. My husband ordered the crab cake which is one of my favorites but I thought it had to much filler and not enough crab. 

My daughter had the oyster po boy which she enjoyed. The food is average at best. Two previous nights before we came here we dined at Felix's across the street and I thought their oysters were much better. 

Service was good.  I probably would not go out of my way to come here if I was in town again.",

You still have to wait but it is faster.  The chicken is great though. Be prepared if you order the hottest level. It will set you on fire,,

If you want oysters and good beer for a reasonable price, hit this place up.  Sure it's a little touristy, but hey, so is every restaurant less than a block from bourbon street.  

The raw oysters were probably the best i've ever had.  Simply amazing, and REALLY BIG!  Plus, they had several different types of tabasco sauce to put on it.  The smoked tabasco sauce gave them a great flavor.  The chargrilled oysters were really tasty as well.  The seafood gumbo was a little underwhelming, but still pretty good.  

Our waitress was very attentive and was at our table within 10 seconds of us needing something.  We didn't have much of an issue with the line and we were there mid-day on a Saturday.  Only took about 10 minutes to get in.  The place itself reminded me of a southern TGI Fridays, but you don't go there to look at the walls.  Get your oysters, maybe a po boy, and some beers and enjoy!",

6f_uyaZZuHp-tG2Apks01w,"Yes, please! The hot chicken (I wouldn't do the damn hot) is spot on - quite the burn, with no aftertaste, which is perfect. The size is unreal (I did the three tender plate). The classic is served over a slice of white bread and two pickles. I am not a fan of white bread, but trust me, it helps cool you down. With the plates, you get two sides and can add additional sides. The plates include options like a breast and wing, or two breasts, or a thigh and a leg, or tenders as an example. 

The atmosphere is cozy with roughly 6 indoor tables that seat 4 each and roughly 6 outdoor, covered spots as well. There are two flat panel tv's on the wall. The counter service is where you order and they bring you the food when it is ready. It does take a little while, but good to know it is cook to order and not just sitting around! 

The staff is really friendly and the food is amazing. Yay! I'm a fan.",,

Errol was our server and was kind, courteous and gave great service. My mom and I shared the Crawfish Étouffe and The Barbecue Shrimp! Both were great but the shrimp dish was to die for!

6hV8mQNfcGDJW63oTwg4zQ,,,Food was very good. Chargrilled oysters were delicious. Our waitress was super friendly. No wait to be seated at 7pm but it got crowded later.
6hhS1sOfLM_u5rVi3ZS8Tw,"My first ""Hot Chicken"" experience and I wasn't too sure what to expect. So essentially it's fried chicken that's sauced. Similar to wings in idea but so much more than that since it was not ""wet"" but still left your fingers lickable.
My first mistake was not ordering their their no sauce chicken so I could really enjoy the super crisp exterior that was a completely crunchy experience.
We ordered the 2 leg/thigh combo that came with 2 pieces of bread, pickles, and 2 sides for a very wallet pleasing $10.50. So I didn't see the point in the bread except that it absorbed some of the hot sauce but also probably because I wanted to fill myself with chicken and not bread. The pickles were pierced into the chicken tops like a sandwich and they got some of that delicious heat from the chicken batter.
So the chicken itself is not overly salted, and the heat varies from (Southern) to their Shut the Cluck Up. It was hot and juicy and as long as you like some spicy chicken, it was just good. The thigh and leg were still attached to each other if anyone is curious. I know some people cant handle it but it doesnt add or takr away from the experience.

We chose a couple of sides (even though the pimento Mac and cheese was looking pretty tempting). The coleslaw is light creamy and the greens were thick slices  (as opposed to a more thin strip some places serve. The winner was the potato salad which was simple, understated and just good. 
Overall, you can't  go wrong with a platter. Good ""hot"" food at a great price.
Enjoy your finger linking good chicken!",,
6i4GENQI47fmGn4dIvGbmA,,,"We ate here Sunday evening and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Everything we had was delicious and many of our selections were on the recommendation of our server, Mary.  We especially enjoyed the oysters Rockefeller and the bananas foster.  We would absolutely recommend this restaurant."
6iEKq0kVKWFgUPYDyHMyKA,,"The best part about this place was the actual master shocker Michael, he entertained us for the most part and gave us a little bit of the history, other than that, the food is not something I will wait in a long line for anytime soon. The charbroiled oysters were very OVER charbroiled(parentheses overcooked).  The fried fish was decent and jambalaya was dry!! I really wanted to give this place more stars but it just didn't perform.",
6iMJvl4_Nzi9bKQLiWpuig,"really good fried chicken...juicy and tender....you can choose the spice level..  
This place is always crowded ..even to pick up a to go, you have to pick up timing slots...but worth the wait if you r in for Nashville's hot chicken...",,
6iOZQKo9zjFRFZHTya0zLA,,"When we arrived there was a bit of a wait but the food was well worth it. From beginning to the very end, the food was just mouth watering. We started off with Fried cheese oyster and the hush puppies, which are a MUST have. The peace PO-boy was also very delicious, if you like seafood. Acme is definitely a MUST have.",
6ieuChaMegprGYaOa99FNw,,"So...I have never had, tried, or even considered trying oysters, however, we were told that when we got to Louisiana, we had to go and try oysters.  One of the places we were told we had to try was Acme Oyster House, and that we had to get there early in order to avoid waiting in line.  Of course, we did not heed that warning and arrived around 6:30 and ended up waiting in line for about one hour.  Once we got inside, we were seated at a large picnic style table shared with several other couples/families.  The ambiance was loud and the decor was casual in a sports bar style way with lots of pictures, and neon signs all over the place.  Our server was quick to appear and got us our drinks and took our order within 5 minutes.  Although, I am pretty sure that he already knew we were going to order Oysters, it was just a matter of which kind and if we wanted any of their Famous ""Boo Fries,"" which are French fries topped with their own roast beef gravy and cheese.  Of course, we could not resist trying the fries, and, boy, we were not disappointed with that choice.  Being it was my first time trying oysters, my wife (who had tried raw oysters before) said we should order both Raw Oysters and Chargrilled Oysters.  The food arrived within 15 mins, which was amazing considering this place was packed full with at least 150 people (or more).  So, I tried both raw and chargrilled and I must say that I prefer the chargrilled oysters over the raw ones.  Chargrilled oysters are ""Sizzling, chargrilled oysters saturated in an herb butter sauce, topped with a special blend of cheese.""  As I did not have anything to compare the oysters to from previous eateries, I will say that I loved oysters (chargrilled style), and will always order them if/when available on the menu.  And as far as the Acme Oyster House, we will most definitely be stopping by again when we get to LA (and getting there earlier too). Enjoy!",
6igg9zUd2vjz5Im8xZPMhw,,It's our first time at New Orleans. There was a long line waiting outside of the restaurant. We divided to give it a try. Must order chargrilled oysters. Really good!!!,
6igwUNvEm1ob-P2oKThj0w,"So good. Don't think twice. Worth the wait, but easier during non-peak times during the week.",,
6ijuFWpTjtzugrAQZs5B8g,,,Was a nice place for dinner. Oysters were really good.  Potions are generous.  Staff is friendly and helpful.   Drinks were really good.  They add dry ice to give it a little flair!  Yummy bread pudding to end the meal.  Would have given 5 stars but the sauce on the crab cakes and the cornbread under the chef special were both cold.
6iysfZYfVfDgmNDFSH2fFw,,"This place was great. I read reviews that said Acme was too touristy or too crowded or the line was too long...forget all that and just GO! We initially went to Felix's across the street because they weren't busy but once we got inside we saw why. We left before the waiter ever came by and the difference was amazing. We stood in line maybe 5 minutes and once inside we were welcomed by a great atmosphere, happy customers and oysters everywhere. The chargrilled oysters were out of this world. I would go back to NOLA just to eat here",
6jnKdgBG9b4zAqbhLA-YEQ,,,I had the shrimp platter the first time. Great batter on the shrimp and a seemingly never ending portion. Slaw - great. Fries - crispy. Try a Nola Blonde beer to wash it down. But what brought me back was the red beans and rice! Really to die for!!
6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA,,"After a nice little nap, I decided to wander down here and get some grub.  The line was long but since I was by myself, I got in within 5 minutes and grabbed a seat at the bar.  Placed my order for a dozen chargrilled oysters and a half and half po boy (oysters and shrimp).  I got a Coke to drink.  Since I was at the bar, I watched the shuckers do their thing.  Pretty impressive stuff.  They place dozens and dozens of oysters on huge trays and get everything prepared.  It kept me entertained while I waited for my food.  

There were a couple of mix ups during my visit.  The waitress lady first brought out my dozen oysters and sat them down in front of the people next to me.  The shucker quickly pointed out to her that they were mine.  No harm no foul.  This unfortunately wasn't the last situation... They brought out my po boy and I started eating it.  Halfway through, I realized that it was all shrimp and no oysters.  I said fuck it because it was good but what happened was they gave me my neighbors sandwich.  Anyways..........on to the food.

Chargrilled Oysters-  5 stars.  Give me 5 dozen of these and watch me go to town.  These were hands down the best thing I ate in New Orleans.  I am headed back in 2 weeks and am going right back to eat some more.  These things were so damn delicious.  Oysters topped with a grip of butter and then sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  They serve them with little rounds of bread so you can sop up the butter and cheese mixture after you are done eating your oysters.  These were AMAZING!  These things were instantly added to my ""last meal on earth"" list.  They were awesome!

Shrimp Po Boy-  This thing was alright.  Besides being the wrong thing I ordered, I ate the whole thing and it tasted fine.  I would skip it next time though and get another order of oysters.  

At the end of my meal, they gave me the check and I noticed that my po boy was not on it.  I should have kept my mouth shut, dropped the cash and then bailed (Karma will bite you in the ass though so I brought it to their attention).  What happened was that earlier when they brought out my sandwich, it was really my neighbors and they never charged me for it...therefore, they never placed an order for mine to begin with.  Anyways....got it all sorted out and paid my bill and left.  

The chargrilled oysters are not cheap ($19.50 a dozen) but Ill be damned if they weren't one of the greatest things I ever ate and they were WELL worth the cost.  Cant wait to eat some more of them and come back in 2 weeks.",
6k9LMZRcWR3O5pWCqN_GZQ,Third time back best fried chicken ever. It's worth arriving early to get a good spot in line. On Sunday's the bacon and cheese grits are amazing.,,
6kGzsVK4cCR9pb84_hmz5w,,The chargrilled oysters are superb. My husband and I split the fried shrimp and oyster po'  boy. It was also very good. To top it all off we had the boo fries. Everything was great. The bartender was sweet and had been working there 29 years. She made me a prickly pear mojito. Loved it! There can be a line at peak dining times so be prepared.,
6kXL9Hje0m0BbI7pghGKJQ,"Have eaten here on a couple of occasions at both locations, the one down by Vandy and the one on  Charlotte, pretty good chicken in a pinch.  The wait can be a little long during peak times.",,
6kYQMsUPAlECLtueb76jZg,,"I came here with several colleagues over the Halloween week, and we were not disappointed by this place.  The 6 of us shared 2 dozen Chargrilled Oysters, which we could not stop raving about and get enough of, Seafood Gumbo (delicious beyond belief), Boo Fries and Crab Cakes, along with an array of drinks.  The environment was laid back, staff was friendly, and again, the food was to die for.  Unfortunately, after the night we had, that's how we were feeling the next day.  I definitely recommend this place.",

6lPsxXRj19sJMmE2wttO9g,,"What a great place for a relatively inexpensive meal and great oysters.  Not sure what happened with other reviewers who claimed their oysters tasted like they had been sitting around - I had the luck to be sat at the oyster bar and watched the guy shuck and plate our order as well as many others!

Besides the raw oysters, the charbroiled oysters were fantastic too.  My girlfriend, who does not like seafood, could not stop dipping bread into  garlicky-parmesan sauce - it was good.  Lastly, the po-boy was great as well.  

The best takeaway from ACME was definitely the overall atmosphere and experience - friendly guys behind the oyster bar, decent prices, good if unspectacular food, and you've got yourself a great time.",
6lTzOs6ezZUOLAFwEe0STA,,"I have a lot of food allergies but had the fish po-boy with sweet potato fries. I took it slow and took lactaid, and came out with a delicious experience and no adverse affects on my stomach. Food is served like a diner. We sat at tables that were pushed together, with a family at the other end. I suggest calling ahead if you're just visiting NOLA, to find a good time with little wait. Saturday night at 8:30PM, the line was out the door and down the street. There is a lot of seating inside. We waited less than 5 minutes on a Monday at 4:45PM. It's under 30 for two with sides and no alcohol. There are couples, families, and friends there. The waiters appear to be in a hurry - diner style. The service was good though, and food was delicious! Great experience.",

I called to see if I could pay his tab and was put on hold 3x and finally got a manager and asked if I could pay the tab for my brother and father who are currently eating in the restaurant, and was told ""no"" by the manager and hung up on.... how can you not take over the phone credit cards when you ring up pickup and delivery orders? I'm insulted. What a shame - I would have tipped double for the effort."
6lscjTMFEccE9qPiWzNrpg,,The oysters weren't as good as I remembered. I came in Monday lunch second time around and took advantage that there was no line at that moment. The oysters were smaller and tasted different.,
6lwIE1p88royigEnRf7PgA,,,I'll give the 4 stars for the cleanliness. The food was marginal at best. My wife had the ribs and they were fine but nothing special. I had the over-cooked blackened redfish. The waiter kept pushing the special but would not say the price. Turns out it was a good 50% more that the more expensive meals. We just felt like we were at a Disneyland theme restaurant of a Bubba Gumps. It did not have a genuine vibe.
6mUK8vzuZeMU1GUctBCp0w,,"I never liked oysters before I ate the grilled oysters here!!  I still dream about these grilled oysters.  The waiting in line is definitely not ideal, but boy is it worth the wait!  We went there for a late night snack and came about fifteen minutes before they closed and there was hardly anyone in line and they don't rush you out either.  We took our time and ate and it was amazing!  If the wait time is too long the grilled oysters at the place across the street are good too but this place is awesome.",

Come here once, get the grilled oysters (which are slightly above average), everything else on the menu was very unremarkable.

No line on a Monday afternoon around 2pm (in December 2012). Otherwise, this place is supposed to have long lines especially during tourist season.

Eat at Acme once, just to say you've done it, but don't bother coming back.",

6nvyacI2VkJ2hJKcth738Q,,The chargrilled oysters are a must. They are perfectly cooked and seasoned. The butter is too die for. Too bad they only give you like 3 small pieces of bread. I would've eaten a whole loaf of French bread soaked in that delicious butter.,

I would've gave 5 stars but I came back for breakfast the next morning & it was pretty terrible. The hash browns were so salty they couldn't even be consumed. But besides the bad breakfast - absolutely recommend their pasta! Omggggg."
6oAmhzd0t0xZ4B3JFLkxFw,,,"If you are a tourist that has never had creole or Cajun food in your life, you might like this place. Foodies...don't bother. Everything is fried...usually over fried, salty or smothered in sauce. The service is what you might expect from a huge, oddly laid out restaurant. I gave them a break because I am not sure I could do better if I had to run my butt off like they do from one side to the next. I ordered shrimp which was terribly over cooked. I ALWAYS order my meat and fish with sauce on the side because I want to know if I am being served spoiled meat. My husband ordered catfish...again, over cooked."
6oHCVfbFGS1BbEXxFdhx5w,,,Very gooood food.   Everything was delicious and the Blackened Gator poboi was legit...

They kept my group with three kids waiting an hour in the rain, and when we finished eating they actually told a disabled mother of two we were with that she had to wait in the bathroom for her ride to pick her up at the door.  If you're a glutton for punishment and over-salted seafood, this is the place be.",

6pAqjo7zgI28wZvBRWpT8g,,"This place is over priced and over rated.  I dont understand the hype. Maybe i am just spoiled living in the pacific nw, land of fresh delicious oysters and seafood.  
The char broiled oysters, which they push,  taste nothing like oysters. They are smothered in garlic butter and parmesan cheese and are tiny.  I hate oysters and these were palatable to me. They were $19.99 a dozen. Save your money if you want oyster flavor.  The fried oysters were better but still not wonderful to a oyster connoisseur.    Po'boys were nothing special either. The crab and corn bisque was good. Overall, not a great experience for $115 for 5 people.",
6pccpLEAUFucNcXqAVxwYg,,Not that impressed overall.   If you have never eaten chargrilled oysters and that's all you want then come here.  The rest of the seafood from poor boys and fried seafood is adequate.  The roast beef poor boy was like a sloppy joe version of roast beef instead of sliced roast beef.  I sometimes wonder if some of these restaurants have become complacent just because they are in the French quarters.  Good golly I have had better fried seafood in Dallas than here. Not impressed,
6pfqquSlvf7otxc18knN-Q,,,"After reading many reviews about this place I honestly expected more. 
We waited about 5 minutes to be seated and I don't know if it was the fact that Mardi Gras had just passed, but I found the place in need of some deep cleaning. The carpet was filthy and the decorations dusty. The restaurant has 2 floors and we were seated on the second floor. We ordered the crab cakes, the oceans oysters and the Caesar salad with shrimp. It took them a looong time to bring the food and when it finally arrived the server said they had lost our ticket that's why it took so long. 
The food was good, the oysters were yummy, the crab cakes too but nothing out of the ordinary. My Caesar salad was supposed to have shrimp and it came with chicken and shrimp, I was fine with that it was good, but like I said, I was expecting more"

6q2HTZzLddHXItEoxzfOVw,If you want Nashville Hot Chicken this is the place to be. You WILL wait in line but make no mistake the wait is worth it. I had the Small White Hot with Pimento Mac N Cheese and Bacon Grits (Sunday's only). The Hot dry rub herbs are the perfect amount of spicy and flavor. The chicken skin is crispy and delicious. The Mac N Cheese is creamy and a good compliment to the chicken. They have a good but small local craft beer selection that made waiting in line a bit easier. If you have the time and want a good treat I highly recommend Hattie B's.,,
6q2kW2a50uAPK-cnpcNo5w,,,So far we have not been disappointed in anything here in New Orleans. Get the crab cakes if you are here. It is right off Bourbon St. We got in quick but minutes after we got sat there was a big line to get in.
6q4stV9ajAu1U2JxaT5VQw,"So a friend of mine that I believe lives in the Nashville area - as well as one of our Uber drivers - told us that Hattie B's is a tourist place and we should go somewhere else. Well this was close to a bunch of bars so we ended up going there anyways. And I'm glad we did. We had to wait in line maybe 20 minutes or so. But the wait was absolutely worth it. I thought that you had to get the crazy spicy chicken, but realized that there are a few different levels of spice.

The chicken was great. I forget which level I got, either mild or the next one above it. But it was great, not too hot. They give you plenty of chicken. And the sides were great, I got the baked beans and fries and they were both superb. My two friends and I all loved the place. It is definitely worth the wait. Don't let someone make you feel bad if you're a tourist and go here. I've been to other tourist traps that are nowhere near as good in quality. I'll go back whenever I go to Nashville. This 100% the dB Stamp of Approval.",,
6q51hrcFuOYeAont3ehRdw,,"This place is incredible! My lady and I were seated at the bar (which I highly recommend for out of towners). It was suggested by us to try the oysters there so we got a half dozen raw and half dozen chargrilled. The raw ones were really good...but them chargrilled ones were like something I've never had before. I mean EXTREMELY tasty. I was also told that the hurricanes there were pretty good. And they did not disappoint! I also was intrigued to try the fried peace maker po'boy! That thang right there was an explosion of great flavors all on my tastebuds. The only reason this palce didn't get that 5th star from me....THAT DAMN LINE!!!!!!!!!!

Granted, you're gonna have a long wait in line when the food is that good at a place. So that just came with the territory. But if you can wait it out, I assure you that it'll be worth the wait!",

I wasn't surprised as they were really busy as usual. So I called back and they said that I will receive a call back from a manager. The weekend went by and I forgot about the incident as to me it was a minor oversight. Today I got a call back from the manager to address and resolve the oversight.

My only gripe was the delivery person apparently did not carry cash and I had a 10 dollar bill.  I didn't want to be a heel and not tip the person for making a late night delivery so I gave her the 10.  So I suggest you choose to pre-tip when you order to avoid this.  I didn't because I do like to tip in cash."

I'm not even a fan of oysters and I LOVED the chargrilled oysters. Looooved. They were delicious. The po-boy was excellent and the bananas foster cheesecake was incredible. Probably the best dessert we had on our entire trip. 

Toward the end of the trip when I was suffering from perpetual food coma, and moving rather sluggishly through the long list of places to eat.

6t-5irNMD8JU88jA5ioA7A,,"In our Smoked Oyster comparison... Dad preferred theirs to Felix's. I thought the were both great, and different. Barb prefers Felix as you can taste more of the smokey flavor.  I enjoyed the crawfish boils, and made a mess of the bar and myself... Happily. Our bartender was spewed and attentive, with a very pretty voice.  
I think I may go graze there again this afternoon, reflecting on Yelp made me hungry!",
6tDbEJesFv0Rk0WHRTZdog,,,Best damn food I've had in a long time! Was so good we went here TWICE during our 4 day trip. Definitely a is a 'must go' for future trips
6t_ebXdb88gu8sC6pntvnA,,,"This place is a NOLA food hotspot for a reason.  We came for a late lunch on a Friday and there was no wait.  The chargrilled oysters were amazing, but I was so surprised by the Taste of New Orleans!  The creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffée, red beans and rice with smoked sausage were so unexpectedly good.  I say unexpectedly because it's a sampler platter, so we were prepared for just enough to give us a taste range for the dish.  No.  We are every bit of the samples on offer and found the flavor and taste to be excellent.  For $19, this dish was on point for both portion and flavor...I may have enjoyed it more than the oysters!"
6u82x6PkhQD2zm6Qa3mxCw,"OK, so all bow down to Hattie B's.  Don't know if it was the first, but it is the best Hot Chicken!  We saw this on FoodNetwork and I was SO stoked when I saw it was across the street from our Hotel.  Line gets long.  If you don't want to wait, order online​ and pick up there (you can still eat it there)! The smallest line I saw was around 3:30-4:00.  Other than that you will wait.

I had the sandwich ""Damn Hot"" and two wings ""Shut the Cluck Up.""  Wife had tenders ""Hot.""  The bean salad side was amazing.  Mac N' Cheese wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again.

The Chicken.  Perfectly fried.  Crispy.  Without the hot,​ it would still be five stars cause they know how to fry a bird.  Tenders are large, so they get a little chewy.  Not their fault, just big tenders.  The sandwich was amazing.  The sauce, the slaw, breast, all good.  The wings won the show.  I judge chicken by the wing.  Theirs was perfect. Again fried to perfection.  Shut the cluck up is hot.  It made me sweat​ but enjoyed every bite.  

I had had Nashville Hot Chicken several times before coming to Hattie B's.  Honestly,​​ I was on the fence.  I thought buffalo chicken was better, but I'd rather have Hattie B's than any other fried chicken.  Take that to the bank!",,
6uAXkp1PNOvdeW_HixikWg,I crave Hattie B's all the time! My friend and I joke about going back to Nashville just to eat here. It is definitely some of the best food I've had.,,
6uCny0qn0S9LPgdFaaFp_Q,,,"After suffering thru a terrible dinner at Broussard's, a snooty and condescending restaurant just up the street, we had lunch at Oceana the next day. We both enjoyed the crab meat  Eggs Benedict .The eggs were poached perfectly on the crab and muffin. Our waiter was great as well."
6ubG89ztkn7BNHoE_gms8Q,,I'm a big fan of oysters and a big fan of New Orleans. You can't go wrong here. I LOVED the chargrilled oysters and the raw oysters equally. I stopped here for just an oyster app as there are too many amazing places to eat in Nola and only so much time.,
6v-JkwdH1kkSXsgMT3hN8w,,,Great place! I had the Crawfish etoufee and a hurricane! I recommend this place for sure
6v0rUQr_NSRnEdDbVERcRg,,,"This is an absolute must.  Make reservations in advance will save you tons of time.  Blacken gator tail was tender and oh so tasty. Crab cakes are to die for, plenty of crab .  Praline duck was tender moist and savory with a touch of sweetness. 
Can't go wrong with the chicken fettuccine, blackened or Cajun both delicious. Catfish over the jambalaya was excellent.  Don't miss this place."
6vOw3zBkN_4WI8VTtCJpSQ,,,"We had so much fun at Oceana Grill! The service was just outstanding. Our waiter was so friendly and informative and really made our evening special. Their bloody marys are spectacular- maybe the best I've ever had.  Their two types of oysters, their special one and the rockefeller were loved by our party.  The overall meal was very good,  nothing fancy or innovative- which is fine! We were looking for a great, simple meal and that's what they delivered. The cajun pastas were all well received and, again, SUCH amazing service here and a nice, casual atmosphere in the heart of the French Quarter.  Keep it up!"
6vX_y1I9PBb2UqCw1Ye2zw,"Ordered the HOT! tender with green beans and the pimento mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was wonderful!  The chicken was hot (both literally and figuratively) and perfectly breaded.  Also, the place has a cool atmosphere.  The patio is really nice.

Only two downsides: People tend to linger on the patio, so it can become very aggressive to find/claim a table.  The vegetable sides aren't great (good, don't get me wrong, but not as good as the chicken or mac & cheese).",,
6vkAaWDOsW4Teg4tXqpVJw,"Four days in Nashville, and this place never had less than 30 people in line, every time we passed it!  Our last day, we decided to ""hit"" it.  Got there 10 minutes before open, on a Monday.  Medium hot chicken, and mild strips, assorted sides.  Both crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside.  Delicious, and it took about 1 hour, from entering the line to our last bite.  Makes our local chicago ""farm"" fried chicken joints pale in comparison...  We'll be back, or will open our own store up here.",,
6vzxwuYzUvMnwPp_gS842Q,,"Get here early or come with just another person because you're going to have to wait for this Nola Mainstay. I came here with my buddy and we got in pretty soon after opening because we elected to eat at the bar. (I did come here during Mardi Gras weekend)

So what do you get here? The oysters... You can get them raw or char-grilled. We got a dozen of both. The raw oysters were delicious paired with the cocktail sauce (i loved the sauce because of the horseradish potency). The char-grilled oysters are the ace of the restaurant. The garlic butter and the char flavor from the grill is the perfect combination for oysters. Depending on how many orders go in at once, you might have to wait for these bad boys to come out. 

I recommend this place and would definitely wait to satisfy my oyster craving. Also this was the place where Adam Richman (Man vs. Food) did the 15 dozen challenge for those who watch the food channels.",
6wIELdKED5J1YvfP2rZNbA,,,"Food is average at best. Service was great (sort of). Got the grilled oysters for my appetizer. Go to Desire on Bourbon street for a much better option! These fell short...to be polite. As did the fish entree the waitress recommended  and I can't even remember what it was. The killer was, and I really HATE this....my substandard entree was brought to the table while I was still eating the substandard grilled oysters! This is a tourist trap restaurant and it shows! Avoid avoid, avoid! NOT recommended!!"
6wRHe58b9X1mP7C86agykw,,Amazing chargrilled oysters ... pure heaven I love the fun atmosphere everyone is so live full of energy never a dull moment,Crab cakes are delicious also pasta and chargrilled oysters and good as well I love this place
6wjY6P0Uk1uUZWUkd46oRQ,,,"My buddy and I went here during our vacation to New Orleans because we had seen it on the Kitchen Nightmares show and wanted to see what changes happened and what the food was like.
Our first trip there was good, the food was tasty, although the chicken I ordered the first night was a bit dry.  
To tell the truth, my buddy and I got out a bit late due to a convention we were attending, and so we ate here three times.  The items of note that were great were the alligator bites and my buddy really liked the duck.
What really was impressive of this place is the courtesy of the staff!  We had a server the first night that was good and helpful, but Renee knocked it out of the park for us.  She gave great reccomendations and even told us a few places to visit in town that were must sees.
Also, one of the owners and the manager came and chatted with us about the show and New Orleans must sees.  Of the places we visited this place was great!"

Errol was our server, ask for him when you stop in. He was awesome!!"
6xAiBY15pIwZ7Q55p0_fyA,,,"This restaurant was okay. I had the Blackened Chicken Pasta and it was good, bugging out of this world but it was good. The crab cakes however were soo salty and soo fishy. We didn't return them cause we are not ballsy but we did not eat them."
6xFER3O8LSKU7DfnKWVcRA,,,The service here is great! We waited in line for about 20 mins but Jacquelyn kept us all engaged and she was hilarious. Then we got our great waitress Mary. Oh Mary we enjoyed you and your fan moment it made our night. Thank you for the great service and it made our experience wonderful. Oh and the food was good!
6xI97AFZKYFqcOw94ntbFw,"The line can be a little bit discouraging, and there are definitely a lot more tourists than there used to be at Hattie B's, but the hot chicken is still just as wonderful.  If you are willing to wait in line and fight for seating, the food is definitely worth it.  I always get the hottest option possible, and it is delicious. The side items are also very good.  I would recommend going on off times for a shorter line and easier seating.",,
6xYdMkmRU7y3f8_NZ_TBFA,,"Got here on a Wednesday for lunch and there was NO LINE!! Yea, I litterally just walked right in. Got a po'boy which was very good and very tasty.

I honestly coudn't stop! the char-grilled were amazing as well. it was my first time tasting them and it didn't disappoint. I would come back here in a heart beat and get more. Try to come mid-week during lunch hours to avoid lines and this place has lines that get pretty scary long!!",
6x_gEUgOEcfXuIQfPqg2mg,,"Great jambalaya and red beans. The boo fries were also very good. Seating was a little cramped and service wasn't the best, but the food was worth it.",
6xje_eYIImNLJU7yoDE0YA,,,Tasted like nasty TGI Fridays. The food wasn't good but our waitress was very kind (only reason this review got more than 1 star) overpriced for what you get definitely not worth your time or money. Much better option in NOLA. Construction on the road makes it difficult to find as well.
6y4fHpyJQgIH87gfUbf6DQ,,OMG - amazing oysters here!! The restaurant seems to have minimal character but you don't need fancy decor to get good food.,
6yICLvU03V-hXE1y0EG-BA,,"My first time in New Orleans, and I had a blast. This place was amazing. I had jambalaya, fried oysters, seafood gumbo, and fried catfish, and it was amazing I really recommend it.",

Good But Average Etouffee. It could have been Hotter (Temperature wise)
You can find this type of Etouffee all over Houston and surrounding areas, so I was a bit disappointed.

My friend said the Red Beans and Rice was Awesome!!

Our Server was very nice and attentive ( I Give Her 4 Stars )

I want to go back for the Oysters......",
6yVgy6lQUsVt_q6OPMKAyA,,,I see why the line is out of the door. This place is delicious! The mardi gras pasta and red snapper were GREAT! Definitely will be back.
6ys4H1AuHINgpL55gdaxcA,,,"Blackened alligator appetizer was amazing. I do not like blackened anything ever but these tasted almost more BBQ than blackened. I got the crab cakes which were good, but spicier than I would've liked (I'm a spice wuss). However, the mashed potatoes were incredible. It seems like a weird thing to hone in on at a creole restaurant, but do not pass on the mashed potatoes."
6z6LOCiQi_QIssUemmT3SQ,,"Local tourist trap. Line to get in is outside of the restaurant. There are several other locals to get Char-boiled oysters in Nola that are much better. If you like to wait In line for for marginal services and environment....you are at the  right location

7--EhYkIuLb1ZrUONG-KiA,I am definitely a huge fan!  I first had their chicken at an office potluck since then I have been there so many times I can not count. I love it!  My sons loves it! My mother loves it!  My sister loves it!  Talk about all in the family.  WONDERFUL!!!!,,
7-7A0Avj47slLGV7yBFc8w,,"Waited outside about 10-15 minutes for a table in the back. Our waiter was terrible, he never said anything.. which is why I wouldn't want to come back and unluckily sit in his section. Customer service -2 stars & 0 thumbs up for him. You can tell he hates his job. Anywaysssss

Ordered the 1/2 dozen charred garlic butter oysters, AMAZINNGGGGGG choice. I honestly only came here to try these oysters since reading all the reviews. 5 stars for them yum yum!!!!

Also had seafood gumbo for the first time... well gumbo in general for the first time. Very interesting. Not amazing, just like ahhh oh! 

Sucked Bc when paying, the tip is automatically defaulted at 18%. My soulless waiter watched me tap on the lower 15% and I felt his gloominess even more. He really deserved less but I just wanted to get the hell out!  Entire time it was like ordering with a robot that doesn't have emotions. No greetings, no ""thanks have great night""! Also couldn't even track him down to get the bill. He ruined my acme experience. Thanks guy","I'm on an charred oyster adventure and yelp brought me here. The waitstaff is friendly, I was greeted many times and my waitress was sweet. 

I ordered 1/2 dozen oceana charred oysters, a hurricane and Cajun fries. The oysters were very good, they were drenched in garlic butter sauce and smelled amazing. The bread was 2 pieces of very plain bread. 

I don't understand why my husband ordered Cajun fries 10pm at night, heavy carbs especially with heavy mushroom sauce... crawfish was a plus. He was feeling adventurous but by the time we got back to the hotel at midnight, the carbs hit him hard. Through the heaviness, the fries were a big portion & the mix of everything and the ranch sauce was good. I enjoyed it but too much was not for me. He ate it like an entree. 

Good try! No regrets! Yolo in NOLA"

7-Qe0lt7XbewyuyTWLyPKw,,,"Visited Oceana Grill twice over the 4th of July weekend 2015 with family and friends. Everybody loved it. The food was fantastic. Oceana has great gumbo. Just because a restaurant in NOLA serves gumbo doesn't mean it's good. Oceana's gumbo is by far one of the best... and the service was really good and attentive. Our server was great. Her name was, Renika. We could tell she really cared about how we were doing and that the food was done right. Renika was very nice and also very helpful with our questions about the area. I was impressed and felt that she represented Oceana very well. One of the best restaurant's in the quarter."

7-bDzvmujz1wQBOXXchdLw,So delicious! Ordered takeout and had it delivered. Came so quickly and was delicious. I understand why it's so highly rated!,,
7-fSJDLAFJCPXbJnhwAzSw,"Love at first bite.  We were told Hattie B's was a must-stop for hot chicken while visiting Nashville, and we were not disappointed.  We lucked out by going a little before noon and only waited for about 15-20 minutes in line.  Even for an hour in line, it would have been worth the wait.  

Although both myself and my significant other love spicy food, we opted for the Medium spice level as this was our first hot chicken experience.  I do wish we had chosen Hot or Damn Hot!! for one of our meals, as we found the Medium to be a nice heat but nothing spicy.  We went with the SM White Plate and the classic Hot Chicken Sandwich, and chose the fries, potato salad, and mac n cheese for our sides.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy on the inside and a delicious crispy crust on the outside.  It was easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  The fries were crisp and delicious, although a little heavily seasoned, the potato salad was good, and the mac and cheese was delicious, taken up a notch by the inclusion of pimentos.  

We loved Hattie B's, and would definitely come back on another trip to Nashville.  I would highly recommend a visit to anyone, regardless of if you like spicy food or not - there's a heat level for everyone here.  The prices were fair for the portion sizes and the atmosphere was good.  As I'm writing this now, I wish I was able to have some sent up to Wisconsin for lunch!","We only made a quick stop for some drinks and oysters, but it was an enjoyable time!  We only ended up waiting a couple of minutes for our table, and although the service was a bit slow due to how busy things were, our server was pleasant.  The char-grilled oysters were delicious, and the oyster shooters were fun.  Acme had a good atmosphere, and is worth a stop.","We stopped in because we were looking for food a little later than other places were serving.  Ordered a fried soft shell crab (delicious, but incorrect price on the menu), as well as a sampler including fried oysters, shrimp, hush puppies, and French fries.  The breading was a little thicker than we would have liked, which did a disservice to the seafood.  It appeared the food had been sitting for a bit under a heat lamp, because there were skins on the cups of ketchup and tartar sauce.  The cup of gumbo we had was good, and the service was pleasant."
7-z1-n0vwelO1Tob81ByeQ,,Delicious.  Sit at the bar and the service is BOMB.  Raw or chargrilled.  Yummm.,
700Y0aCVMdZCoRUBjIfMxA,"This is a true staple of the south... phenomenal is the word that describes how I feel about wow this chicken sandwich tops it all for me I had chicken sandwiches all over and this is the one that can not ever be compared to any,  with this being said full of flavor truly unforgettable steaming hot chicken with the perfect amount of breading (meaning that you can actually see more chicken meat than breading) and the wait is a bit long but it's well worth it everything from the super creamy pimento mac-cheese which is one of the best I ever had all the sides taste delish this is #1... And I will be stopping by every time I have the chance to visit Nashville",,
70C1kvOqElQT-s4prkyvqg,This place is amazing! I am a wimp and only get the mild but it's to die for! The midtown location has not much parking but the streets by it have street parking you just have to be careful. The fries are super yummy and the macaroni and cheese is so creamy and amazing,,
70aptnFPstx4xm6AKJQE5w,,,Really good food.  Cream Brule was amazing.  Loved the BBQ shrimp and the Gator bites.   Jacelynn did a great job even sang Happy Birthday to my wife.
70arfOvHdwcTs36nzft17Q,,,Amazing staff and shout out to Keith our waiter. Greeted and seated right away. Ordered the Cajun breakfast and st James crepe both amazingly delish. Service was quick and loved the coffee.
70bTHzJnMyBeSic4UtsgNg,,"All I can say is, I REALLY enjoyed my dinner when I visited. I had the fish and shrimp platter and was a good choice. I've never eaten swai fish before and it was delicious although, I thought they served catfish but, doesn't. The shrimp and fish was well seasoned, crispy, and delicious. I didn't care for their cocktail sauce but, the tarter sauce was nice. My fiance had the shrimp po boy with a side of red beans and rice. Both our dinners came with an abundance of fries, mine also with some French bread. We also had hushpuppies which were good. The atmosphere is a little louder than I liked. And there was a short line forming outside to get in when we arrived. Luckily, we were only a party of 2 and got in quickly. Service was alright but, would've liked refills on our drinks but, our server never asked or offered. Overall, I will definitely be back when I visit, again.","Went here during my first trip to NOLA and was open to trying someplace new. I had a steak from here with the trimmings (mashed potatoes and greens). They both were average. The steak was a little on the smaller and thin side but, tasted pretty good flavor wise. My husband had jambalaya pasta with bread. He said it was just, okay. The atmosphere was a little dark and we were seated upstairs. Not sure if we'd return."
70jyLdnMTzN63aOmLaAI8w,Wait sucks balls.  But get some cold water and it's more bearable. Cashier was awesome with tasting beers despite the queue.  Here's the genius game plan: go small dark hot and add a shut the cluck up tender so you can go there without ruining the whole meal (or the next day :) ),,
70oWd9OZT0tLPj8uDlKbNg,"Very good flavor, but VERY long wait. Def worth trying atleast once. DAMN HOT flavor was VERY spicy due to dry rub. Overall good food chicken was cooked very well.",,
70onr2srncBty215w-hDpg,"Me and my boyfriend came in at 4:30pm on a Saturday. This place seemed like the go-to spot for fried chicken in Nashville. There was no wait, and the menu gave you a big selection. I got the regular fried chicken, and my boyfriend got the hottest fried chicken. They had other names for the spice levels but I forgot. He has a great tolerance to heat, so he didn't find it too spicy. You also get to pick sides:greens, mac and cheese, coleslaw etc. The meals also come with a slice of white bread.

This place deserves two stars because the fried chicken was really nothing special. It honestly tastes like chicken deep fried in yesterday's oil and the sides are just any regular sides you can find in any Southern restaurant. And for me, KFC's chicken was much better and flavorful. I tried pouring myself a drink from the soda fountain and there was soil on my hands from the cups so I didn't drink anything. My boyfriend went to the bathroom and there were so many flies, it made him puke all the food out. He has a weak stomach.

We did end up speaking with the manager and he resolved it by giving us a full refund. He was genuinely apologetic about what happened. I don't think I'm going to come back.",,
70rBqoyaYqPJQ57sCxVZqQ,,"Don't be intimidated by the line, the food is worth the wait. Their chargrilled oysters are life changing. Also make sure to save some room for the bread pudding!","Just landed in New Orleans and the first place we stopped was for lunch at Oceana Grill.  On a 90+ degree day, the wait was thankfully only 15-20 mins.. 

I'd recommend grabbing a margarita while you are wait- they are served with dry ice and chilled perfectly. 
For food we ordered the Fried Alligator Tail , Shrimp Creole, and the Taste of New Orleans.

I wasn't a huge fan of the Shrimp Creole, it is a tomato based dish and it didn't have much spice to it. The Taste of New Orleans was great and I would order it again if we ever go back.   It's a sampler that includes the Creole Jambalya, Crawfish étouffée and Red Beans & Rice. I don't usually like red beans and rice but theirs was sooo good.."

There's something quintessentially New Orleans about this institution - it's all about the food and the quick, but friendly service. Yes, it sucks having to wait outside in what feels like 100-degree weather, but I swear the sweat and hunger pangs will be worth it. 

The raw oysters were AMAZING and the chargrilled oysters were even better. I'd highly recommend the half po' boy and side option if you want a little variety. I had the shrimp po' boy (it's a classic) and a cup of jambalaya, which was perfectly spiced and seasoned. Definitely check out Acme if you're anywhere near the French Quarter.",

Their jambalaya pasta reminds me a lot like the New Orleans pasta from cheddars but only better of course. 


Honestly, the portions were pretty good to the point it was better to be shared between two people. 

It does get crowded at times, I mean it's near bourbon street. Kind of expected."

While I was in New Orleans I had oysters in some capacity at every meal.  Acme were by far the best!

The first time we went to Acme we waited on line, which was fine, the line moved quickly.  We were sat at the oyster bar, right under the web-cam.  I, of course, texted all of my friends to check me out, but none were available. :(

The oyster shuckers were standing right in front of us, and were friendly and engaging.  They recommended different ways to dress our oysters, talked about life in New Orleans, asked us where we were from, etc.  It was fun to sit and talk with them.

Watching the shuckers, you can tell the oysters here are fresh, they just keep shucking and shucking!

Along with the oysters, we tried a couple of po'boys, (oyster, soft shell crab, and combo oyster/shrimp.)  The soft shell crab was my favorite.  We also had the boiled crawfish, which was perfectly spicy.

Acme has a fun atmosphere, friendly staff, and DELICIOUS food.  It's not the tourist-y place you would expect from seeing the neon sign outside.

If you have the chance to be in New Orleans, go!",
72389kWS4NBz4XTlm-mXAA,,"Much like everyone says, the wait into this place wasn't that long, especially since we arrived around 5:30pm. The staff was friendly, but they were not the most attentive. We waited long for our drinks let alone our entries. Customers who were seated after us even had their orders taken and received their food before us. The Chargrilled Oysters were a little on the salty side. The first three were good, but any afterwards was too much for my palate to handle. Perhaps, it's a taste preference, but no one else in my party of four liked it that much. The word is Coup's is much better. I will update my review after I get a chance to compare.",

72_mlsaRJILTDAb0mltUtg,Okay so my friend told me about this spot so me and my husband went and checked it out. I love the spice on the chicken the pieces are big . I loved there lemonade I think I went back four times. I will visit again,,

When the waitress asked me how's the food I almost cried, maybe brought back some hidden flavor memories;) go there if you in New Orleans."
73-9vUHHgXYHq_UVpjJ0Vg,"Great service and awesome food, worth the 30 minute wait on line.


large white meat- medium spice level and the chicken was juicy with crispy skin highly recommend it. 5/5

Chicken sandwich - great choice for sandwich lovers, a bit salty for me. 4/5

Shut the cluck up chicken - super spicy so be aware. Recommend sharing it instead of individual order as it may take away from the base flavor. 4/5


Dessert:
Banana pudding- good flavoring 4/5
Peach cobbler- right amount of sweetness for us 5/5
Ice cream - was a freebie because we were struggle with the spice level of shut the click up. 5/5 freee :)


Sides:
Mac and cheese: great with some red pepper bits in it 5/5
Fries: they were decent 3/5 
Coleslaw: fresh 4/5",,
736qevgQZN9KCR9SPk37HA,,"I tried to get in on Friday but the line was too long, so we went across the street to Filex.  Should have skipped Acme today.  I had the corn seafood chowder, there didn't seem to be any seafood, only corn and it cost almost $6 for a cup!  Also had a poor boy ""Peace maker"" for 13.99.  You only get the sand which which was ok, but it seems like it should have fries or coleslaw. The platters are $20+ and you have to choose between hush puppies or coleslaw.  The service was good. Oh and on the way out I saw a row of Microwave ovens.. That explained it all. The food is most definitely edible, but I recommend you go across the street to Filix's.  The food there is much better and they don't nickle and dime you!",
73H5RV3iVsb8WxInASrdSw,,,Really love this place! Great service and amazing food! Had a final dinner here with the family before they head home. The jambalaya was very flavorful and had a ton of shrimp and alligator in it. Finished with the strawberry cheesecake! 10/10!
73Q7AKl5ByiRSHLtUSMdbQ,,,Service and food was delicious. Definitely recommend !! Our server Pamela was excellent and had good suggestions. First time being here and definitely coming back!
740OhxbAvZVoVIfdIsWuPw,,"a lot of hype to this place and was a good but not worth a 45 min wait.  There are tons of other places to eat, but this place is iconic so you have to go at least once.

pros - 
- bread pudding was freaking good
- decent selection of beer on tap
- I didn't realize this, but their oyster shooters are in shots of vodka.  I thought they came in shot glasses with some sauce.  Ordered 3 of them, ended only shooting 1


cons - 
- beer in cups..not my thing.  I like my beer in ice cold glasses.  I get it's the whole bar hop thing, but at least give me the option to have glass
- place was small and dark...kind of divey","Even though it's right off Bourbon street, it was still a little hard to find.  Got there around 5pm on a Sat night and waited 5 min to be seated.  They have an indoor and outdoor area, we sat indoor.  We ordered the charbroiled oysters, their famous crab cakes, the pasta jambalaya and bread pudding for dessert.  I also got the Abita Andy Gator which apparently has something like 8% alcohol but you can't tell.  Here is the breakdown.

- Charbroiled Oysters - Even though they are not as big as the ones at ACME, I actually liked these better.  These ones were sitting in a butter sauce and not just baked like the ACME ones.  They give you a spork (yes a spork,  like the ones that you get at KFC) to eat them with which actually goes well when eating oysters.  The only drawback was that the bread it came with seamed stale
- Crab Cakes - You get 2 decent size crab cakes...tasty but I wouldn't say mind blowing
- Pasta Jambalaya - Pretty good..came with shrimp and alligator sausage.  It was a good change of pace from all that fried stuff and gumbo I had been eating.
- Beer - I really like the Abita Andy Gator.  It's got good flavor and is perfect for a hot day

Tip
- We got a 10% off coupon from one of those places selling tours and used it with no hassle."
74Myfl8pOGeKcmkVTimsvg,,"Our first night in NOLA and we didn't have a reservation, so we decided to just get on line at Acme, we waited about 30 minutes and then were shown to our table in the back.  The ambiance is casual and energetic.  Loud music and people just having a good time.  If you like quiet dining this is not the place for you.
 
Love that there were 3 kinds o f  Tabasco on the table.  Beer was served nice and cold in plastic cups, so they were kind of small.

We started off with grilled oysters, they were quite tasty, but smothered in more cheese than I would have preferred.  I ordered the soft shell crab platter served with fries and hush puppies.  I love hush puppies and you never see them in NY, so I was super excited and they did not disappoint.  Nice and crispy and so so good.  The soft shell crab was huge, I don't think I've ever seen one that big and it was delicious. The fries were nothing to write home about.  The homemade cocktail sauce was super spicy but good.

Hubby ordered the smoked sausage with red beans and rice.  The beans on their own were a bit on the bland side, but when eaten with the sausage tasted much better.

We ended the meal with some bread pudding which totally hit the spot.  Our waitress was friendly and even though she was quite busy she kept tabs on us.  A solid place in NOLA definitely worth giving it a try.",
74noZKV4DkuBysmEmZvs-g,,"This is one of the best restaurants I've been too. My husband went in with the plan to sample cajon and creole food. The crab cake and jambalaya were better than I could have expected. The service was helpful, quick and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant.",
74yqK9NSJG_R1VdERivs9w,,,Best food in NOLA. You have got to try the crabcakes. They were so good we had them 3 times in one week and I know crabcakes being from Maryland
759Z3GOVDq_DlZPjgb0Zhg,,"The highlight of my NOLA trip.
I went there twice during my 5 days stay there at 3pm and 9pm. I waited about 30 minutes each time, and I think it's totally worth it.
The charboiled oyster and seafood etouffee are the best. I tried all the high rating restaurant during my stay in NOLA and they all offer the similar dishes, however, nobody beats ACME. Their banana frost cheesecake is out of this world. I was very full after my meal and I ordered it to-go, and I just couldn't stop after one bite and finished the whole thing before I left. 
If you are party of two and no not mind sitting at the bar, the wait isn't really that bad. 
I may go back to NOLA just to eat there again!",
75Q-MjJeK6zpQ-97yR-mDQ,,Best chargrilled oysters I've ever had! The oysters shooters were good too at only $2.99 it was a nice price. I definitely recommend taking the time to wait in line and yourself some oysters!,
75ZcjAn67bm6bjEOiuv5hQ,,"The first time we visited Acme, the charbroiled oysters were amazingly great. The second time, the wait was long, so we had charbroiled oysters at a different restaurant across the street. We should have stuck with Acme! The wait would have been worth it.",
75gOR8wk6p-g4WXhpWMbaQ,,Absolut empfehlenswert. Die gegrillten Austern (chargrilled Oysters) waren wirklich sehr lecker; der Preis ist auch sehr fair. Zu zweit haben wir ohne Probleme einen Tisch bekommen; größere Gruppen (4+) sollten wahrscheinlich lieber vorher reservieren.,
76b-ECAuLhTP5y0o8AZdEw,"Was it worth the hype and wait? Yes. 

As a fried chicken AND spicy food lover, hot chicken had a running start in my books. But the fun experience was definitely one I would come back to.

We came to this location at 10.45am on a Sunday morning (they open at 11am) , and waited 45 minutes. I wouldn't recommend getting there anytime after 10.45am.

I've been to both the west end and downtown locations, once for a team event and once with my friend visiting from New York. No real difference, except a shorter wait on the west end location. 

It was a lot of fun to try the different spice levels. Definitely get a bit of endorphin rush from the heat. Anything above medium is not for the faint of heart. I had a nibble of the ""shut the cluck up"" and sure enough, could not speak for a good 10 minutes as I nursed my burning gums and tongues with ice. The ghost peppers come back to haunt you every minute. 

Juicy chickens and spicy fun - a Nashville must-do! The only reason I give it a 4 stars is because I like the spice/flavor profile of some of the other hot chicken places (like Pepperfire) slightly more.",,
76eInqmdBGjIcG1eQiG_lA,,,"A must when we come to New Orleans, Oceana serves great seafood and steaks! Their new Cajun fries are the BOMB though! Wait time is short so don't let the line fool you! With three floors they move people in and out quick with great service! And all their cocktails come with a little dry ice to give it that special NOLA flair!"
76kKgofIK8uAfWkV63Dtaw,,,"Karla is the sweetest! We came for lunch on Christmas Day and she took care of us! Thank you Karla, Merry Merry Christmas"
76rU5U1DGxDsXu93y3i0Uw,"Whew!  Lordy!  I nearly burned off my eyebrows with these hot chicken wings!  If you like HOT Chicken - you'll love this place.  You could smell the wonderful smells of the Hot Chicken wafting through the air from the parking lot and around the corner.  

My friend and I tried it for the first time last night - I had seen it while driving down Broadway and I know what a fan he is of Hot Chicken - so, I suggested this place because, well, I love new places and i like writing reviews for Yelp!  

We arrived shortly before 8pm and placed our order.  Of course, like all quality chicken places - they only fry your chicken when you order it.  So, it took maybe 20-25 minutes to get the Chicken delivered to our table.  The place is very laid back with a couple TV's on the wall - which was great because I was wanting to watch the Louisville/Florida Sugar Bowl game (Florida got spanked!).  

My friend ordered the White Plate, in Medium - which had a breast and a wing.  He also had the friend and baked beans.  I got the 3 Wings Plate, also in medium and also with beans and fries as well.  The fries were run of the mill - the baked beans were OK - but I didn't come here for the fries or beans - I came here for the Chicken - and boy it did not disappoint.

I honestly can't believe they have two spice levels above medium (Hot and Damn Hot).  I'd be afraid of setting the bathroom on fire the next time I went if there was anything hotter than medium.  I like hot wings and hot stuff in general - but wow.  This was REALLY hot - or maybe I'm just out of practice.  Thank Goodness for the fries and white bread.  The starch seemed to help cool my tongue down!  But this isn't a hot that is just heat without flavor - the flavor was great..and the chicken was moist and delicious.  However - the 3 wings were HUGE!  I couldn't believe it.  I got through 1.5 wings and that was all I could eat.  

As much as I enjoyed the wings - they skin wasn't as crispy as I like.  I like it crispy and crunchy.  This did have a little crisp on them - but, I like it a little more crispy.  

Anyway - if you like Hot Chicken and are looking for a new place to check out - Hattie B's will fit the bill nicely.  Nice staff, clean space, good food, reasonable prices - seems like a home-run to me!",,
770VGA6RSSvNrBRKKC4cEQ,,"Went to Acme on recommendation.  This is a tourist trap.  Felt very much like cattle being herded in and out as quickly as possible to keep seats free.  Staff was not very friendly but I felt that they could be friendly if not rushing folks out the door. 

Food was pretty good.  Raw oysters were very good and good sized.  Gumbo was tasty and the étouffée was not bad.  Both were very, very mild which, again, seems like one of the perils of being a tourist trap...they play it safe instead of making things the way they were intended to be made.  

There are too many amazing restaurants in NOLA to spend your money here.",
77kwq4xHOYoXSUCnCOtyiw,,,"Just tried the the Taste of New Orleans (April 12 2019) and it is so good. The red beans and rice cooked perfectly the andouille sausage, juicy and spicy, and the crawfish style gumbo was awesome. If you're even queasy about eating crawfish this is not what you have in mind. The whole dish is awesome!!"
78-gbeGIlu8sRZKzGWHjeg,"Ordered Large White- 2 breasts with wings attached medium hot
Best part was the black eye pea salad...other side dish was slaw and it was good. Nothing special

I really thought this would be a great food experience...before I get to my opinion on the bird I have to say service was excellent 

The bird was greasy to the taste and touch...and the neat was disappointingly dry....not terrible.. But not juicy as I am used to at my fav Chicken Place....

""Drum roll please""

Gus' Fried Chicken in Memphis - Spicy.crispy. Not greasy and juicy

I liked Hattie B's but prolly not going back  

However it is deserving of 5 stars since service was outstanding",,
783Rke5_ddO35KA22Y5hqw,,,"Unexpected. I was looking for a quick seafood stop and it worked out in my favor. The food was not as over priced as most of the places in the area. 
The wait staff was polite, some people dont think thats important or they take it for granted but its important. I had the taste of louisiana which is Oceana's sampler. Very good, you can see the cook making the gumbo in the kitchen, always a plus when he doesn't look like he hates his life. Atmosphere is dark, noise level was moderate. Great place, i would def recommend and I would go back again."
78FnAUagLFPt_XdIfW_9bQ,,"Excellent for oysters and poboys!!!! The fried fish was AMAZING!!!
The place is very crowded, small and loud.

78s22Gipb3ZHbRlAIeaZYA,,"We waited for about 10 minutes outside in line for dinner, which wasn't bad considering we heard the line could be very long. The food was good. We had the craw puppies, New Orleans medley, chargrilled oysters...to make a few. I would order all 3 again, especially the craw puppies! Service was good considering the place was packed and our server had a couple of large parties. Definitely worth checking out if you come to NOLA.",
78ss1niJS71u0I5CardUeg,,,"This was our first meal in NOLA. It was amazing! We talked about it the entire trip and compared everything else to it. They had inside dining, very cool atmosphere, extremely nice staff that seemed proud to be there and the food was ridiculously good all around. I had the blackened redfish which was perfect. The portions are generous and everything was flavored well without being cliche' Cajun. It's a little pricey, but that is expected given the locale. Very highly recommended! Get the greens..."
78yTrxuig9g7arlQXgJ9nw,,,"Let me start by saying I have read all reviews on Yelp before we made plans to have our Valentine dinner here. I was not disappointed. Short line outside maybe a 10 minute wait, 15 at the most. Our servers name was Sara, sweetie. The crab cakes were awesome, shrimp platters were loved by my entire group, Alligator bites awesome and the first time I have tasted I might add, and the tropical storm mixed drink is a must try. Wonderful dining experience that I will definitely try again. Chef Ramsey eat your heart out."
793USmgqSMqOkV7KknFQvA,,,It was a great experience. Very authentic New Orleans Food. We are from Los Angeles and our server Nicole B was amazing. So personal and attentive. Treated  us like family.
795QxOCC1Z8BedlnaX5v3w,,"Grilled oysters, raw oysters, po' boys, etouffee, it has it all! Our group basically ordered some of everything and shared.  I didn't have a bad dish.  Yes, the wait was long, yes it's touristy, but it's one of those rare places that stays true to the cuisine in the city that it's in.  I would have no hesitation about returning again.",
798fXIPDD9ivKyHpIBSjZQ,"This is literally the best fried chicken I have ever had in my life. I can't wait until they open Hattie B's in Atlanta. I am feeling very emotional just thinking back on my experience and writing this review. I want to cry from the pure joy the chicken brought to my taste-buds.

Our first night in Nashville, my girlfriend and I arrived at Hattie B's a little buzzed on a rainy Saturday evening at around 9 or 10 PM. There was a line out the door! Granted... The store is small, so if the line exceeds maybe 8 people, it will be out the door. The line moved relatively quickly (or I did not notice the passing of time).

We ordered a hot half chicken with a side of mac and cheese and potato salad. The order also comes with toast and pickles. The food came out relatively quickly (in the time it took me to set my stuff down and go to the restroom), and they split the half chicken into two baskets for us! That's some great service right there!

The half chicken is huge! You can easily share it between 2 people if you both have smaller appetites. The chicken is crispy, juicy, and actually spicy. My lips were burning, but the mac and cheese and potato salad helped kill the heat. Perfect sides to a perfect entree. 

We both felt kind of sick after finishing off the basket, but it was worth it! The moment they open a location in Atlanta, I'm going to rush in line to try some tenders and the other sides.","My friends and I stood in line for 20-30 minutes to eat lunch here the weekend before Fat Tuesday, and it was totally worth it! Probably my favorite meal in New Orleans. And the wait wasn't too bad, because I got to play Pokemon Go...

I shared a half dozen of Chargrilled Oysters and the Fried Peacemaker Po Boy, and holy $#%&! They were both amazing! 

Chargrilled Oysters: Literally the best oysters I've had in my entire life. Chargrilled in garlic butter with a side of french bread, these gigantic oysters are delicious! I was literally moaning while eating them. If I'm ever back in New Orleans, I'd return to Acme to just order these.

Fried Peacemaker Po Boy: A trip to New Orleans isn't complete without trying a Po Boy somewhere, right? This po boy has fried shrimp and oysters, and it's delicious! Pretty heavy, because y'know... it's a po boy with fried seafood... but totally worth it. The shrimp and oysters were perfectly crispy and not too oily. Just amazing~

In addition to these menu items, I had the honor of eating my friend's hushpuppies, because he doesn't like them. The hushpuppies were decent, but I've had better at other seafood restaurants. Unless you hate oysters, just order something with oysters, because it'll be your best bet.

If there's a line, just wait it out. The food is worth it.","Pretty much located on Bourbon Street, it's a convenient place to grab a nice sit-down meal while exploring the area.

My girlfriend and I stopped by for dinner after watching one of the largest Carnival parades on the last weekend before Fat Tuesday. Bourbon Street was crazy busy, but we quickly found a seat at the restaurant. Everyone was obviously more interested in drinking on the streets than having a nice meal. 

We both weren't that hungry, so we shared the Taste of New Orleans. At this point, we had already tried jambalaya and crawfish etouffe at Gumbo Shop, but might as well try some more while we're in New Orleans~ It was a great choice! Worth the higher price point. Much better than Gumbo Shop. The food came out extremely quickly (even our server was surprised), and we devoured it in minutes. Everything was flavorful and had a good balance of rice and meat. 

In addition to the amazing food, the service was wonderful. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful. We already knew everything on our plate, but he offered to explain the different items. I thought that was nice. He was very upbeat and happy despite the drunken crowd, and he happily gave us a 10% discount for checking in (we just tipped it back to him). 

Overall, wonderful food and service at a convenient location. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting New Orleans."
79QvK8IA_jFGtO0Xoca-GQ,"Delicious hot chicken, great friendly employees who clearly look like they enjoy their jobs, crazy yummy Mac and cheese, and usually a line out the door! This place is a must in Nashville!",,

79r8Rulol3CvAkKkDXqggg,"I go to Prince's, Bolton's, and Pepperfire periodically.  While Prince's and Bolton's are the best, Pepperfire is more than acceptable.  I always get the hottest possible when I go for hot chicken (or anything else).  The hottest at Hattie B's is what I can only imagine mild might be at one of the other places.  It was so mild that I could safely rub my eyes after eating it with no fear.  The chicken had way to much breading, or the breading had to much chicken.  I got the pimento mac and cheese for one of my sides because of other Yelpers' reviews.  I've had better mac and cheese from a box.  The ""Southern style greens"" were not as good as Glory Foods canned greens.  The one slice of white bread tasted good.  I am normally not this critical, but it was that bad/underwhelming.  I will not go back.",,
7A5eo16_TjCYE-KPkgsgNA,,"GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!! My husband and I first visited acme in November 2018 and we just visited it again July 2019. It is THE BEST seafood you will ever have, we typically don't wait in lines longer than 30 minutes but if the line was 2 hours for acme we would wait in it because it's worth it!! 
When you get your table don't hesitate to order everything you want because it is all fantastic. We love the seafood gumbo, crawfish tails, cat fish, the hush puppies, the shrimp, and of course the oysters! Also the pecan cobbler is very good!! 
We will always be eating at acme every time we go to New Orleans.",

It was a dive, counter service type place with a line that wraps around the sidewalk. We waited for about 40 minutes. The line moves quickly. The food is outrageous. We all got varying degrees of hot chicken, all delicious. Meat is tender and not dry at all! The sides are also delicious and fresh. 
Go. You'll love it. Service is great!",,
7AKsq7j2laMZjprXIEJZtA,This is the best hot chicken because of the skin. If you like perfect crunch and spice on a chicken skin then this is the place. The sides are pretty good too. Mac was ok ..tasted to much like pimento and American cheese and just wasn't crazy about it. the real star is that banana pudding tho... so good and rich. And the chicken skin. That dang perfect chicken skin. Good stuff. This is a must stop.,,
7AQjCyuHfF5DiUH1yGj_xA,,"I think there are better options for Cajun food but you cant argue the freshness of the oysters. We got a dozen on the half shell for starters and I got the fried oyster and shrimp sandwich called the peacemaker. It came on soft bread with Tabasco mayo, shredded lettuce and pickles. It was awesome, the only draw back is for 10.00 it should come with fries. My friend got the jambalaya and it was so so.....All in all its a pretty good Cajun joint for being off Bourbon St. If you want more authentic food, head outside the quarter.",
7AT_bxcIwgFuLowMwMQitg,,"Was so excited to eat here because of all the high recommendations and reviews but sad to say that it was probably the worst meal we had here. We only had to wait 10 minutes on a Sunday at 1pm and was seated at the bar. We ordered a gumbo, dozen raw oysters, half dozen charbroiled oysters and 2 of their special cocktail drinks.  The gumbo was just bland, the oysters were big, overly warm and sandy (I usually can eat all my oysters but we couldn't even finish them), the drinks were also super warm :( The only thing good was the charbroiled oysters. I stopped eating raw oysters for the entire trip because these oysters ruined it for me and just grossed me out.",

7BiWqhSJ-h0drMp7xCZC8w,"First time I came here, I wasn't sober but through my stupor, I knew this was damn good chicken. I mistakenly got hot and that irritated my stomach. My friend's medium was fine though. 

Next day, I came determined to have another chance at this wonderful chicken and I had my way with it. I wish I had gotten hot, but I wanted to play it safe with medium in case my stomach didn't like it. The chicken was so moist. I brought it back with me on the flight to Chicago and it still made a delicious lunch. The skin was beautifully crisp and flavorful. I didn't care for the bread. The pimento mac and cheese was a nice touch.

I know they're planning to expand to Louisville, but can you please give Chicago a go? I don't even eat meat anymore but I would pitch a tent at the front door if they expanded here.",,
7Cq0uUMgnzm2iahPwy9V-g,,"So glad this was my first experience with char grilled oysters! The oysters were perfectly seasoned, grilled, and buttery. The bread was perfect to soak up the butter. We ordered about 3 rounds of oysters for a hungry group of 4 girls. This is a staple in NOLA","The cajun pasta here is amazing!! We came here twice just for that. And to top it off, they have an awesome creme brulee!"
7D8Nkcb6ujJCGIBkQ93Nhw,"I think this place has ruined fried chicken for me.  It's absolutely as good as it gets.  Lo, and behold, the pinnacle of fried bird.  It's all downhill from here.

And don't think I'm overexaggerating this place.  When you try it, you'll know.  The perfect fry, all the delicious spice, and fantastic sides to boot.  The only downside is the wait - and with food like this, I understand why.

Pro tip?  Call ahead and pickup!  Give your bird some time to cool in the car, top open, and it'll be perfect when you get home, assuming you're not too far away.  You'll avoid crazy waits that way too!",,
7DIUhI4eW_OEes1iogN4GA,,"Definitely recommend going here at least once! Don't worry if there is a long line--it moves quickly and their chargrilled oysters alone are worth the wait!

The black-eyed pea salad is incredible and is the perfect mouth-cooler after a bite of spicy chicken. And the beer list is great. My only complaint is that usually I've finished my beer by the time we get the chicken, and no one wants to be the person who orders two beers at Hattie B's.",,
7DjnE6_DMiqlHpzqOTxqYA,,,Remembered seeing this place on Kitchen Nightmares and decided to try it out for breakfast on our trip to New Orleans. My wife ordered an omlette that was alright but nothing special. I ordered the eggs benedict and it was not good. It was three of them dumped on a big plate with no thought to platin. The real offense was the hollandaise. It was broken and had no flavor whatsoever. Nothing you should ever spend 13 dollars on.

There was a still a long line and at the most random hour - shortly after 3pm! My guess is around 25-30 people ahead of us, but most were in larger groups. Luckily we were only a party of two and therefore just waited for less than ten minutes. We were seated at the bar which I have no problem with. We ordered ""the hurricane"" drink since it seems to be a New Orleans thing - it was alright, just like your typical rum punch. Pass. We ordered a dozen of the chargrilled oysters, a seafood étouffée, a small gumbo, and a soft shell crab platter with a side of jambalaya and hush puppies - all to share. 

It was my first time having chargrilled oysters and it was like a party in my mouth! Very flavorful, so buttery and delicious. I did think they could've dialed down on the salt though. The seafood étouffée had a strong delicious seafood aroma (and no, i don't mean fishy at all) - just very, very rich. The flavors of the gumbo appeared much more mild when eating with the seafood étouffée, but nonetheless was yummy. The soft shell crab is your typical fried soft shell crab with batter, same goes for the hushpuppies. The jambalaya was moist and totally hit the spot. 

Overall, tourist trap or not, I enjoyed my meal here and do recommend it.",
7E40XW3oydqQZmG3-9ddoA,"Went with my kids. Waited in line for about an hour and a half. We got two orders of ""Large Dark"" with a waffle, baked beans, mac & cheese, french fries, and banana pudding. Each ""Large"" order includes four pieces. They automatically divided everything up into four dishes for us. One order of the chicken was ""Southern style"", which means no heat. The other was ""mild"". Ultimately I could barely tell the difference. If you want to little heat definitely get the next level up.

The fried chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. We all definitely enjoyed it. The waffle was a bit soft, for my taste. The banana pudding was good, not great. The remaining sides were just OK.",,
7EHqMmb38NqScM-B3E-WDg,,"Didn't love the place, but didn't hate it. the part that stops me from giving a better review is the fact that the service was subpar. won't go out of our way to come to this place again. was JUST ok.",
7ERWFpqE1e1shTzRZxhM7Q,,"There will be a line when you arrive and don't you even dream about passing it up because of that--it moves pretty fast! After actually dinner here, I've concluded that I would have been willing to actually wait double the time I did--its that good! Boom boom shrimp is scrumptious but the winner are those chargrilled oysters. Holy Cow they are epic!! These beautiful oysters are chargrilled and topped with a herb butter cheese mix. They are out of this world. Go ahead and order the dozen. 

For mains I got half a shrimp po boy and a cup of seafood gumbo. The sandwich was generous and the gumbo money. Hubby for the fish/shrimp platter with some hushpuppies that I'm sure were sent down from heaven. 

Y'all this place ain't just delicious.. it's addictive! Such a high recommendation!",
7ERrYRMUQrUTuaCq5eDTaA,,,"Went to Oceana Grill with my friends for a weekend trip. Was seated promptly, got helpful service, and great recommendations from our server, Whitney. I ordered their famous oysters and it was delicious!!!"
7EVVgoudNkdYNutswnMbZg,,This restaurant was great for our group of 10 who were in town for bachelor party weekend. Everyone's food was delicious and prices were reasonable. Waitress had no problem cashing us out at a timely manner and was very friendly might I add.,
7EVsupIaYa9Cmfo4jJoTmA,"I was worried that this place was going to be overrated, however, the food was just as yummy as we expected. Though the line was out the door when we arrived, it moved surprisingly quickly for only having one register. We also had no problem finding seating even though it was dinnertime on a weekday. It did take another 30 minutes after ordering to receive our meal, which made us a bit impatient. I got the small dark with baked beans and potato salad. The beans were nice and sweet without being too much and the red skin potato salad was perfect for cutting the spiciness of the chicken.

The chicken was dry-rubbed with all the spices and fried. The meat underneath was still tender and juicy and the spice added flavor without being overpowering. The pickle was also a nice touch to munch on to break up the heat of the chicken. The chicken is served on a slice of bread that soaks up all the juices underneath, but I did not find the bread particularly good.",,
7FRkyAoulxJu6KWHpUpcfw,,Chargrilled Oysters were to die for! Line moved pretty fast so don't be tempted to go else where.,

7G2oi9rdEZBSYgWxjhp15g,Damn Good! Best fried chicken I've ever had!!! Stayed hot through the last bite:)  Peach cobbler was so delicious:P Lots of food! Stuffed!,,
7GJYL2sXTBWo0kYDGBex1w,"When we order spicy food, we expect spicy. But the Damn Hot chicken is hot to a new level, and the really enjoyed the spice level. We ordered the hot chicken as well, with potato salad and coleslaw. The staff was friendly, upbeat, and knowledgeable about everything we asked about! Great food and people!",,
7GOYLBYLJfjGgKKP6xgRYQ,,"What more can be said about this fantastic eatery? The only downside is the normally long line outside -  but you can always get a cup of cheap wine from the bar across the street to drink while you were waiting.
The ""Boo Fries"" french fries with the roast beef debris gravy could be larger.
Best to go during Easter season.",
7GSOAWAlmIvKdbAVFBL_Cw,,"What can I say, I wish they had this place where I live! During my trip out to Nola, we my friends and I heard this place is the place to eat. We got here around 1 pm and there was already a line out the door. Don't worry, the line moves fast. 
 
When we got inside, we ordered the oysters first. A dozen of the chargrilled and a dozen of the raw oysters. I'm not a seafood person by I was blown away at how awesome the chargrilled oysters were! It came in a tray with bread and had lots of butter and cheese on the bottom. Sure enough, those disappeared quickly. Normally I don't eat raw oysters but my friends kept raving about them so I had to try one. Boy they were right! It was awesome. The marinara sauce was on point. We also ordered the seafood étouffée with a side of crawfish tails. Omg it was amazing! 

I would definitely try this place again if I'm in the area.",
7H4fmqiBPuW7vaeExLkD-Q,"The hot chicken was great!  The chicken was plump and flavorful. Even if you love foods hot and spicy, I recommend getting the spice level 2 milder than you think you can handle. You can't, but I am from the Midwest. Delicious sides. I especially enjoyed the black eye pea salad. Fun craft beer on tap. We waited 45 minutes, but most of our party went across the street and drank while a few of us stayed in line When I return to Nashville, I will go back, but get there by 11:00AM or a bit earlier.",,
7HHYQEBNMTiqzBeP_5uXGw,"My brother and I checked out Hattie B's when he was in town. If you're able to, get there before it opens as we arrived about 10 minutes before the doors opened and there was already a line. We were able to get in and our food ordered within 30 minutes roughly. The chicken was delicious, I ordered the tenders with the medium sauce, not too spicy but it had a kick! The mac and cheese was good, as well as the black eyed pea salad, however it had a little too much vinegar sauce on it. Overall a delicious Nashville staple! I'm definitely looking forward to trying the chicken and waffles next!",,
7HcPuASo-umj_SyMr6iSCQ,,,This was a best choice that we made on the trip. The seafood choices and other choices were great to try. I would definitely will be back in the future.
7IArdrDU5glXX1bGOutz_Q,,,My first meal in New Orleans and it did not disappoint. Great atmosphere in the French Quarters. I had the Taste of New Orleans which was well done. I also had the Swamp drink which was delicious. It was also open until 1AM. Staff was friendly and responsive!
7IBmD7A7XojlSfgI3XiA4g,,"This is a fun place to go but it is very busy and very crowded. The tables are pretty small and uncomfortable, the servers are nice but they are very busy, the oysters take a while to come out, and you almost always have to stand in line outside before you are seated. This place is as famous as it is small. The food is great though.",
7IkZdVTvEDMlOP6vl4uiaw,"Hattie B's is one  of those places that lives up to the hype. I've only been to the one in midtown, never been to the other. But the one in midtown is great and always delivers. The staff is usually really nice, and the chicken has great flavor and spice, the sides are great as well, espically the red potato salad.  Try to go in early right when they open or like after 4. Because if you go on the weekends or around lunch time. You will be waiting in line for a while. It's definitely worth the wait, but if your not one for waiting then beware of the time",,
7InRGjg2ZIeUgALd89whvQ,,"The charbroiled oysters were fantastic, the medley dish was delicious (with rice and beans, jambalaya, and gumbo.  The soft-shell crab po-boy was good, but the oysters stole the show.  There's always a line out the door, but then once you walk in there are lots of tables open.  I wonder if that's their way of pacing the kitchen, or a ploy to make them look like they're incredibly popular?",
7Iuc8m5_yo6NbkAUpt7Kkw,,"I can't believe this place is such a hot spot.

Waitstaff is less than pleasant.

Food ain't that great, I've had better seafood etouffee at other places w/o a line.
To be fair, I didn't try the oysters.

But from first impressions, I'd say eat elsewhere in the Quarter.",
7Ivzp3G88rq0TOrTODEUsw,,,"Got the Maris gras pasta and it was delicious only thing is to $25 and the portion was extremely small.... Flavor does in fact make the situation better but overall pretty disappointed with the little amount of food I got for paying so much. 
Not worth it"
7IwKwCRrHrDt7QB8CsFTYw,"Possibly the most amazing chicken that I have eaten in a long time. I am used to good chicken but this was on another level. But be warned, I got the medium hot and felt it. It is VERY spicy and not for the faint of heart.",,
7Ix6TYbphOXFp1RHuNtmRQ,"Grew up in south and have traveled all over the world. So have sampled fried chicken from coast to coast and border to border.  (consider myself an expert in this area). The chicken is good and is a regional take on fried chicken but is not the best fried chicken. That said if you are in the area and craving fried chicken it is worth a stop. As I had not had the hot fried chicken before I opted for medium chicken and ordered two extra wings with hot and damn hot. Tried extra sides so had potato salad , greens, Cole slaw, and back eyed pea salad.  Sides were all homemade and good. Especially appreciated the cold slaw when I tried the damn hot wing which while not unbearable will lite u up. The medium chicken is spicy but not overly spicy and I would think would give the hot chicken experience to the avg person. Would I go back ? Yes would I stand in line for an hour after eating here before no.

If you really want great fried chicken and never had anything more than KFC don't hold this up as the best example of fried chicken.
the bar for fried chicken in a restaurant is not set by Hattie B look to Willie Maes in New Orleans as a prime example.",,
7IxHNhFo-jLtEXawSIffog,"I had a list for my first trip to Nashville -- only three and a half days to hammer out about two dozen stops (most food and/or drink related).  Prince's was closed for a solid 75% of my trip so my local dude took me to Hattie B's.  We went post-lunch rush on a Monday afternoon and like nearly everything I experienced on my trip, service was quick and especially friendly.  The two of us (especially dude) are fans of the spicy food.  Real, real spicy.  Like raw bird's eye chili in every bite of fried rice and mi quang, whole serrano chilis sliced up in scrambled eggs and on tacos and cajun and cayenne and hot sauce in copious quantities on anything and everything that warrants it.  I mean that in all sincerity.  It's not a contest or challenge...we just enjoy the heat.  This is not to say that we aren't interested in the challenge of an absurdly hot bird...  

I'm not going to complain about the heat of the chicken because it was sooooooo finger lickin' good that it doesn't matter.  We did a half bird (white meat -- ""hot"" and dark meat -- ""damn hot"").   It's good fried chicken.  Salted (not salty)?  Sure, of course.  Flavor?  Off the hook.  The oil and season soaked bread at the bottom was ridiculous.  I've been back home in SoCal for just over a week now and I have craved Hattie B's chicken at least a dozen times.  I barely remember the sides I had -- beans?  I think they were a bit on the sweet side but perfectly fine.  And mac & cheese.  Fine too.  

About the heat though...obviously there are a few hot chicken joints I need to try on my next trip to Nashville for comparison purposes.  The ""hot"" wasn't hot for us.  The ""damn hot"" was maybe a touch spicy.  I think we both enjoyed the chicken enough that we were too full to get a second order of ""shut the kluck up"" but I'm pretty sure next time I might do at least half of the hottest of the hot without hesitation.  Bottom line:  delicious bird and an awesome local beer-on-tap selection to go with it.",,
7J684N9KyjMYhyTZJ0oWhg,"This was my first experience with Nashville Hot Chicken.  The wait was around 30 mins, but 100% worth every minute we waited.  The food got out to us quickly.  Every component was delicious.  We ordered the medium heat on our chicken.  If you don't want an overwhelming heat medium heat would be perfect for you, as it was for us.  The pimento Mac n Cheese and Southern Greens were amazing also.  Overall a great experience.",,
7JAdkaWbXuXA4YULqxKaMg,"Coworkers raved about this spot until I agreed to go.  900+ reviews: nice!  A guy I know said he ate the ""hot"" flavor chicken and couldn't taste anything for a week.  Hell yes!  Cause me pain!  Well it was kind of a pain, but not in a good way.

We got there at 11:15 and the line was already out the door.  It wasn't moving.  This was because the cashier AND the other guy were both engaged in animated conversations with patrons about ... stuff not related to food.  Come on pick it up!  We ordered, I got the strips with the ""hot"" flavoring, with beans and greens on the side.

The food arrived fast, I'll give it that.  The sides were damned decent, the chicken however was only ""flavored"" in that it was dusted on a few sides with cayenne powder.  Didn't detect any other flavors, and it is worth noting that I barely registered the heat and my taste buds still work fine.  The chicken was overcooked also, dry and stringy in too many places, hard to get the knife through.  

There were issues with condiments as well.  I had ordered a side of blue cheese and GUESS WHAT?  I got mayonnaise.  Something that the server said they don't even have in the store.  I sent it back and got it replaced with the real blue cheese that turned out to be another tub of mayonnaise.  I suspect they think it's blue cheese.  I assure you dear readers, it very much is not.",,

7JUxVupxj8JmlYlBm7Ioyw,,"I am not big on seafood but I tried the Charbroiled Oysters that my boyfriend ordered and they were delicious; extremely flavorful, fresh and beautifully presented. My Oysters Rockefeller soup was delicious too, if a bit salty.  

I had the Fish Poboy which was crispy, fresh and the fish seemed to be good quality (not fishy, white meat, etc). 

If there is a wait to get in, you should definitely wait! It was just the two of us so we were able to jump the line a bit and sit at the bar but the line moves quickly from what we saw when we were waiting.",

We ordered the best oysters I ever had. Delicious. Nice workers, excellent service.
I got the medley. Jambalaya, gumbo, red beans, and sausage for a great price.
Moral of the story, great place. Will come back soon.",
7JiwGIYyr8W4xguSsIi1sQ,,"Rounding up from 2.5 stars.  Had charbroiled oysters, raw oysters, crawfish poo boy sand which, hush puppies, and fried crawfish etouffee.  

Maybe it was a bad night.  ACME's last night before going to phase 2 opening.  My friend who lives here thought the food was amazing, best seafood in town.  I don't see it.  All four of us shared multiple dishes.  

We waited so long to get into ACME, that when our food arrived, we forgot to take pictures.  

The hush puppies were good but how hard is that?  Anyone can deep fry corn bread balls. 

The Fried crawfish on the poo boy was good but the bread was dry.  Etouffee over rice was lifeless, reminded me of those $2 froze weight watcher dinners you ate in college because that was all you could afford. 

Oysters were fresh, with clean shells (I'm appalled that so many restaurants barely clean the oyster shells of the muck and crap that are on the shells).  But Fresh is a minimum here for just an average review.",
7K-z_b4H0DlrEPgznidoQQ,,,"This place is worth the stars. 

1) food flavors are authentic and everything we have tried so far tasted incredible. It's not a small restaurant but the flavors served makes it feel more like home cooked style 

2) friendly staff throughout. Every team member we interacted with was genuine and sweet. They had to work on Christmas Eve and still carried a big smile 

3) they're open on Christmas Eve and Day! Fortunately Oceana was part of the few restaurants that was open on the holiday. Of the restaurants we dined at during our stay in New Orleans, this one is at the top for all around quality."
7K0BG14yXsxCW9RVBP2JLA,This place is my one true love. The chicken has so much flavor. The sandwich is incredible. The sides are delicious. They have a nice little selection of beer. Sometimes there is a line and it takes some time to get your food but that's because the secret is out. It is worth the wait. The staff is always very friendly.,,
7K3QGYDSgT0SPOdwtbOc2Q,,"The chargrilled oysters are great, and this place is worth the wait just for that!  
If you don't like oysters, the broad menu offers a nice selection New Orleans comfort food at a reasonable price.
The place is busy and loud, service was very efficient, not very friendly though. They are good at making sure you get in and out fairly quickly, but then it's not like you go there to relax over a leisurely dinner.  
I'd go back for the oysters and a drink at the bar.",
7KhcfzFyxxMDskX8HKSuGQ,,,This spot was hoppin! Make reservations online before you go to avoid standing in line for a table. Food was all delicious and freshly prepared.
7KnLMwVAi1DMrqHaod9jmg,,"Without a doubt, Acme Oyster House is my favorite place to eat raw oysters. The oysters are super fresh and very meaty. I love Gulf oysters - they're so much meatier and substantial compared to the scrawny little oysters we tend to get on the West Coast.

Because I really hate waiting in line, we showed up shortly after opening at 10:45am. If you love raw oysters, then having a couple dozen for breakfast is great, right? We were seated pretty much immediately when we arrived, and I ordered a dozen raw oysters on the half shell and soft shell crab platter with two crabs. The oysters were incredible and the softshell crabs were the softest and most tender that I've ever had. I was still in the mood for a few more oysters so I had a dozen more for dessert. Delicious!

Unfortunately, the charcoal grill was out of order the day that I visited, so I was unable to try their famous grilled oysters. Definitely will have to try them next time!",
7Ko3v-x_Xzyr6pVSYnTBSA,"Not really sure how this has so many glowing reviews. 

Stopped by as soon as I landed in Nashville with a craving for great spicy fried chicken. It tasted good but the batter was oily and not very crispy. 

If you're in NYC, check out Sweet Chick and then compare to see why 3* is justified",,
7L7oYXodgbjowfaIGHmDgQ,What can be said that already hasn't been said? First time in Nashville and this seems like a staple that must be had when in town! I had to patronize this establishment for some famous hot chicken! I took an Uber to come here and did not disappoint me! I ordered the medium style chicken sandwich and seasoned fries. SO delicious! I was happy to get my hands on this meal. Even the medium is HOT! The wait was only about 40 minutes in line for us. Not bad at all. Right now the outside patio is all that's open for dine in service. Perfect patio and view of the crazy lines. I am very happy I can here from out of town! Worth the hype! Worth the wait!!,,

After the group of 20 went in she yell at us to stand behind the last stantion when they stood in front of it for 20 minutes. Then she asked if we wanted table, or if we'd take a seat at the bar she could set us now. We started to ask questions and she RUDELY said I need a Yes or No answer only. Then she changed our arrangement as soon as we walked in. What a rude and arrogant first person to meet at a restaurant for the first time.",
7MdlyhLdYT6FdgFjfwL4OA,,,Pleasant surprise.  We were looking for breakfast on our last day there and stopped in since it was close to the hotel.   Saw the crab cakes and had to try them (despite wanting breakfast).   They were delicious.   We love crab cakes and they were some of the best we've had.  She had a veggie omelette that was topped with an amazing sauce.   I had the New Orleans style French toast that was also delicious.   Happy with our unplanned visit.  Would go again.

the second time in NOLA, I came back again but it was in august, and unfortunately, crawfish was not in season. we had the mixed seafood platter and the shrimp/catfish po'boy. their fried catfish is the best. i dont really find fried oyster that good, but the combination was a good choice and the serving size is plenty to fill you up.",
7NEGRAsLF0NXvAbm4uJQvg,,"Went last night and really disappointed. Found prices high for what you get, really slow service and everything is fryed so you have no real healthy options. You wait a long time if you want a table and if you sit at bar it is really cramped. Big tourist trap.","Had a great experience especially compared to the ACME oyster. Was able to get a table very quickly and service was great, prices reasonable for what you get and food was very tasty.

7NWGSE4jyisfMNNpsSJXLA,,,"First time in New Orleans and this is a place with one of the most and highest ratings so I decided to give it a try. Made a reservation for 2:30 pm and got there around 2:25pm and was seated by 2:35. The waiter was quite busy so didn't take our order for about 10 minutes but that gave us enough time to order everything we wanted when he came around. I ordered the Cajun fries with blackened alligator and the taste of new orleans as an entree. My husband ordered the bayou duck. The food was okay, I wasn't wowed by the food. It is pretty basic food and I'm guessing the high amount of ratings is due to its location so it is frequently visited. The taste of new orleans came with three different dishes and when the food was brought out no really explained which was which. Also the bread my disk came with wasn't the best. My husband liked the bayou duck and said it was good. I would not recommend this place honestly its pretty basic and nothing special."

I immediately ordered the fire grilled half dozen oysters. I had read enough about it through the reviews that I had to try it myself. When it hit our table the oysters were bubbling with butter and Parmesan that my mouth started to salivate. As I took a piece of bread and oyster, I saw that it was coated perfectly with enough butter. It tasted wonderful and was not overwhelming. Cutie enjoyed it as well;) The shrimp po-boy was tasty with the right amount of crunch. I used the Tabasco chipotle sauce that was given at the table which made it smokey yummmm! He had the rice and bean bread bowl which looked a bit intimidating to me ha ha! It was HUGE and the rice and beans was spilling out of the bowl! The smoked sausage he thought was good. He wasn't able to finish it all as it was carb overload.:) We left satisfied and full! Great fun atmosphere and vibe!",

7PGtiY1g9-sLteQe9uZemw,,"I've avoided this spot for years because I'm not into oysters; however, this weekend I was in New Orleans with a friend who adores oysters so I decided to take one for the team and give it a try. We tried to get food here on a Friday night around 9p but the line was wrapped around the corner. Since it closed at 11p, we didn't bother and decided to come back on today (Memorial Day). Great choice because we were third and fourth in line at 1013a (doors opened at 1030a).

The restaurant reminds me of an old school pizza place with its dark interior, kneon signs and dark paneled walls. Really cute with a casual feel. We were seated in the corner next to the kitchen so we could see everything in the front of the restaurant (the kitchen, the bar and the entrance). There is additional seating in the back past the kitchen as well. 

Within 3m of being seated we were greeted by a waitress who immediately asked if we were interested in the charbroiled oysters. We ordered a dozen of those and the craw puppies as appetizer. I also ordered a hurricane and he ordered a bloody mary. We like our drinks to pack a punch so because our drinks were weak, we both requested an extra shot which was perfect! Those charbroiled oysters smelled awesome so I tried a piece with a piece of that melt I your mouth bread it came with and was pleasantly surprised. It was very tasty! And those craw puppies were very spicy and full of flavor. Loved them also. For the entree I ordered 1 crab cake which came with french fries and 1 side which I chose potato salad. He ordered the fried shrimp and oyster po boy with a side of gumbo. My crab cake was larger than I expected, it didn't have much flavor but it was full of lump crabmeat. If they had seasoned it more, it would be perfect. The french fries were average shoestring fries but I didnt like the potato salad. It was full of onions and mayo. I like my potato salad without onions and with eggs, mayo, mustard and relish (Louisiana girl). It also came with bread but I didnt eat it. He loved his fried oyster and shrimp po boy. He said the bread was soft and the fried shrimp and oysters had a nice flavor but he said the gumbo was nothing special...he said some of the rice was hard. Lol

Overall, our experience was good. The service and drinks were good and the oysters were better than average.",
7PTrkj8THOJJoX9Bn7U89Q,Nashville is the place to go for Hot chicken and Hattie B's is one of the best options you can pick. Some may argue that they aren't the best and I think you could make a fair argument for that but their chicken has always been my favorite.,,

I ordered two drinks that were very sugary and when it came time to pay Scott came over to me in a very RUDE way and attacked me as a customer for ordering drinks that were sugary.  I ordered the prickly pear margarita and asked for sugar around the rim not in the drink. Most margartias are made with either sugar or salt on the rim and not in the drink. I sent that back. Then I ordered a prickly pear mojito and that was very sugary as well. I sent both drinks back due this. SCOTT came up to me in a very attacking way and said ""no you order sugar in the drink"" and don't order this drink again and he walked away very rude. I will never return to this restaurant with that RUDE Man there again. He needs customer service training that is not how you handle customer service.",

My boyfriend and I got the sampler where you could try a little red beans and rice, gumbo and jambalaya.  None of it was good, everything lacked flavor.  Chargrilled Oysters were meh and the rest of the boys got Po' Boys and they were very basic.  

To be honest I didn't continue eating because I didn't want to waist the room in my tummy when there was so much more delicious food to the town had to offer.

Wouldn't recommend... so many other places there that are way way better.",
7Pz_YJIwkBhuFT4Kc5aSAQ,This is not your typical KFC's. This place reminds me of the joints I use to go to in my old neighborhood in Sunny South Dallas. I got the large dark which consist of 2 drumsticks and a thigh. Since I was not sure of the hot intensity of the chicken (taste not temperature) I went with medium. And I hit the right taste level for the chicken. The chicken was great along with the greens and fries.  If this place is a staple for Nashville I can see why. The line went out the door but worth the wait.,,
7QKNAkoaHyd5gx46p0CgLg,,,"Wonderful food and exceptional service!  The best seafood omelette I ever had!  They are a little pricey, ($43 for 2 people)."
7QOFjv_3BvQxvKLlgWy9oA,,"Was not impressed at all. The server cleary did not care about making our time at Acme memorable. We wanted fresh oysters, but they they weren't selling them for the day. Our only option for oysters were grilled oysters, which were very salty. We also had a Shrimp po boy that was forgettable. Acme seems to be a staple and a popular joint in New Orleans, but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.",
7QTh-fkw9Nr2lO10-PV8yw,,"Loved the chargrilled oysters!  I mean, seriously, I have never had a tastier cooked oyster dish.  I can't tell you what goes into this dish, but it must have included some garlic, parmesan cheese, and possibly butter?  No matter what, I really enjoyed these oysters.  If you check out ACME for nothing else, at least try the chargrilled oysters.  You won't be disappointed.

I also had a 1/2 and 1/2 po'boy--half fried catfish, half fried shrimp.  The sandwich was tasty, but far from spectacular.  On a separate occasion, I tried the fried crawfish tail appetizer, which was served with a delicious sauce (aioli probably, with horseradish).  Again, nothing out of the ordinary.

Needless to say, stick to those chargrilled oysters.  The raw oysters are just fine also, to be sure.  I did find it odd that when they shucked the oysters, they left all the sandy mud on the outside of the shell, which meant odds were good that some of the sand would infiltrate your oyster.  Not sure why they do that, considering how texture is so important when it comes to oysters, and the last thing you want is to bite on a grain of crunchy sand while your trying to enjoy your meal.  Oh well.

I would definitely stop here for lunch again someday.  In fact, I went there two days in a row already!",
7QX-0rFqzJcc9aGxrZnlOg,,This is one of favorite spots to get charbroil oysters the ppl in here are extra friendly and helpful while at the bar they are courteous to the customers by giving refills sampling raw oysters until the order is ready give excellent conversations to make you feel comfortable as you wait always positive about any situation always giving great recommendations on what foods to try never any negativity with the crew of Acme my favorite spot is the one on Veterans because you park there without getting a ticket or towed so if you looking for a great spot to enjoy oysters and a drink go to Acme on Vet's they have the best in town during the week day very relaxing and friendly environment to enjoy yourself with your mate or friends,
7Qbx2f242kyY5766ZWo7Ng,"I might be hated for this, but I think it's slightly overrated.   But I gave it 4 stars because my chicken sandwich was mild was good.  Fries were excellent which is soooo important to me.  Lol. Prices reasonable 86-87 for 6 of us.  Chicken on bone wasn't impressive.  The strips are good but the shut the cluck up heat is miserable hot.  But for who can, doooo.  I cannot.  A pinch made my lips and tongue die a little.  They are missing out by not selling large cups if ice cold milk...and shots of milk .  We had a great guy (employee) helping us out so it was nice.

He said the fried catfish was some of the best he ever had. He loved the size and taste of the fried oysters. He really enjoyed the fried shrimp as well. I ordered the Crab cake platter. SHUT. MY. MOUTH! they were the best crab cakes I EVER had. Big, full of flavor and chunks of crab meat! The crawfish, mushroom cream sauce was like heaven! We ordered the strawberry cheesecake to split for dessert. Fresh-made and creamy, it hit the sweet spot to cap off the evening. Brad, our server, was attentive and personable. We will definitely be back."

He had a plate of scrumptious Oysters Rockefeller (prepared with an unusual and so delicious cream sauce) and I enjoyed blackened gator !!! Our waiter was so personable and helpful. It was clear that the entire staff were most concerned that we have a wonderful dining experience which we did!

The local did tell us we must order them and I'm glad we listened AGAIN!

We had a party of about 8 and we ate a little of everyones food because they actually serve you nice size portions and everything we ordered was really great. From the seasonings and flavors - to the texture. Someone in my party ordered the steak med-well and it was one of the best steaks I had eaten in NO, melt in your mouth like... NO JOKE

 I've been to NOLA dozens of times and for some reason this is my first stop here bc I think I stray from bourbon street a lot, especially towards the evening. But I will definitely come back and you should definitely stop and at least.. AT THE LEAST.. get the crab cakes!!"

She also informed me that it was a $25 fee for every person that didn't show up.  We decided not to make a reservation and just came in early for dinner.  The service was excellent (which does not reflect their terrible phone service previously) and the food was great!  Unfortunately, we didn't order drinks so I can't make any comments about them!  I ordered the crab cake pasta.  YUM! It was a very large crab cake in the center of fettuccine and alfredo? type sauce.  The serving portions are very large and worth the cost!  In summary, don't try to make a reservation here.  Just come in a little bit earlier because the food and the service is awesome!

7SmEWHH-f7tYmRAwEBSceA,,"If a restaurant has a branch in the airport, you know its famous but that doesn't necessarily guarantee its good.  In any case, I figured nothing to lose popping into the French Quarter branch of this oyster institution when I didn't see a line in their queue outside to try some.  I got seated at the shucking bar on the right.  The restaurant itself is casual, divey, loud, and almost obnoxiously neon-lit, although underneath that, you can see some classic decor.

Went with half dozen raw oysters on the half-shell and half dozen chargrilled oysters, which I haven't had before.  I got 7 of each (not sure how that works out to be a half-dozen).  The raw oysters were big and plump looking, accompanied by simple cocktail sauce and lemon wedges.  Although fresh and good texture, I was entirely unimpressed with the taste; I'm no oyster connoisseur but I've had my share of both West and East coast oysters in many places and these just lacked flavor of any kind, very bland.  The chargrilled oysters, on the other hand, were a surprise.  Topped with garlicky melted butter and cheese, they were cooked through but still juicy, a bit of smoky flavor, and enriched by the sauce.  Never had anything like it and really enjoyed that.  Another Abita (what else?), the amber, to wash down the oysters.

Would skip the raw oysters, may not be a fan of Gulf oysters, but the chargrilled are worth having.",

I was so bummed, I'd been waiting on going to Hatties for 2 months but the line outside was ridiculous, so I thought I'd play it safe and indulge at home. BOOOOO! Is all I have to say. I've always enjoyed their food since the day they opened. Literally, The Day They Opened.  I've eaten at two of their other locations, but it just wasn't as good as Midtown. So, I went back to Music Row for the ""real Hatties"". Well, looks like they've outgrown their britches. What a shame!  I'm O U T. Back to Prince's, The Original Nashville Hot Chicken.

Where we had a huge issue is with the gentleman at the register, Matt. He is extremely rude. I asked if they had any vegetables sides and he offered potatoes. I jokingly replied ""potatoes aren't vegetables"" and I think he got offended?? We kept trying to correct the tone of the conversation after that but eventually he blew up and said ""Can we please stop talking about this"" and walked away. We looked at each other like wtf just happened. I've been a server so I understand how stressful Saturday's can be, however, you can not explode on customers. It was awkward to say the least.

7TTC7ch14XLYHLFC1YVoIg,,"Hmm, I don't quite understand why people would say that a dozen chargrilled oyster priced at $20 is actually high. Even half-sized raw oysters are priced at $3.5 per oyster in Los Angeles... I have been to ACME three times, and I enjoyed it EVERY SINGLE time. Since the wait is usually very long, we would always like to make our wait well worth..here is a list of things we ordered for my boyfriend and myself just the two of us: 2 pounds of boiled crawfish; 1 dozen of fresh oyster; 2 dozens of char-grilled oyster; one pull-boy; one Jambalaya; one gumbo; and one rootbeer float. And yes, we finished them all in no time, so you should know how amazing they are! 

Since lots of people have commented on the oysters and the pull-boys, I feel obligated to say something about the rootbeer float, definitely the best rootbear float I have ever had in my life, and it goes so well with the spiciness of the cajun food.  

I still dream about their char-grilled oysters and hope one day I will be able to find something comparable in Los Angeles....So far, none of the places that claim they can do char-grilled oysters have come even close to what I have had in ACME. I don't say this often at all, but for ACME you will regret if you skip the line, cuz the wait is all worth it!!!",

The thing that I loved is they don't skimp on quality ingredients or meat in there dishes. The jambalaya pasta was amazing my only complaint is the accompanying bread was cold.

The fries were battered and seasoned
The seafood was crisp and light to let the flavor
Of the seafood shine.

They've got a decent selection of craft beers which you can get by the glass or pitcher.

The chicken is so freaking good, they have multiple heat levels I've gone with hot which is 2 down from the top but I think next time I'll go up one more level.  The chicken has consistently been piping hot and very moist with a very nice coating of seasoning on it and the skin was nice and crisp.  Not greasy.

i ordered their boo fries to start and a dozen chargrilled oysters. my brother ordered their craw puppies to start and jambalaya. his girlfriend got the seafood etouffee. the starters were amazing. my brother ate probably....90% of my boo fries. he loved them so much that he wasn't looking forward to his entree (which was delicious, too). i actually tried everything that was ordered. the craw puppies and seafood etouffee were delicious.

now, those chargrilled oysters. first of all, i should have ordered 5 dozen of them instead of one. second of all, i couldn't decide on whether it was unladylike to just drink the butter from the oyster shells or not. i decided on breaking 1 inch pieces of bread and soaking it with butter. those oysters were dry by the time i was done eating. i didn't even notice the bread on my plate until i tried to figure out how to consume all that butter.

Raw oysters (I don't eat raw, friends had them and said they're very fresh and juicy)

Service is excellent, waiter is very attentive and friendly.",
7Z9Mot9kFY1HqGST4nfTkQ,,,Get the Praline Duck! Amazing. They also have a delicious crab cake appetizer. Our server Michael was extremely accommodating.
7ZB9KdTNT9w0nFSNo7UXDw,,,"The food was pretty good... while the service is terrible. We got our order delivered to us. The delivery guy seemed a little out of it, and took our money and almost walked away with the food... After he left, we discovered that they forgot to give us two of our food items. I called back immediately, and they said the items were on their way to us. Nothing ever arrived (and it was already too late at night to call back). We called back the next day, and they RUDELY gave us the ring-around, making us call back at night to speak to a night manager. The daytime manager was extremely unfriendly, and never even offered any sort of apology (a simple ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" would've been sufficient). I called back in the evening, and the phone was handed over to a several people. After hanging up on me a few times times, I gave up.

I would've given 3 stars if the food was better. The only item I actually liked was the praline duck."
7ZGtk-6gNCeO7-ZkeK7ZhA,,,"Wasn't impressed by decor but I can get over that.  
Service was meh.  
I was soooo excited to try this place from the reviews only to be let down. 
Ordered grilled oyster (could only eat three) 
Ordered crab cakes: They were ok.  Nothing to write home about. 
Ordered red fish and shrimp: This was pretty decent.  
GOOD LUCK on your visit.  
Sincerely hope it's better than mine."
7Zc2ECZNDKFvwxaj5hcHsw,,,"My waitress Whitney recommended the special, which was blackened redfish over a jalapeño, crawfish cornbread dressing with a side of corn maque choux. It was a 10/10. This was literally top 5 best restaurant dishes I've ever had. I'm glad I went with Whitney's recommendation. This is classic New Orleans cuisine."
7ZfZF7aWGNkpq9B34zQIew,,,The shrimp poboy and catfish etouffe were to die for and the fries were amazingly crispy. Would definitely recommend!
7ZphJwBXvDzUMO1MJg8U0w,,"With a place that has much history behind it and seeing it have lines all the time that I have been to NOLA (5 times and counting), this place has to be on your to do list of places to eat if you visit. 

Everything is friend in NOLA...I get that...but the grilled Oysters they have here are off the hook. I don't know if it's the butter on it and other seasonings but we ate so much of it there. Everything else I ate there kinda tasted the same where ever I go...it's all fried. 

Tip: If you going to wait in line...go get a better across the street at Penthouse so you can at least drink something while you wait in line:) Expect to wait at least 25 mins or more if you are about 10-15 deep with the line outside.",
7Zq8VkdkuDuysFlrNfHwMg,,,"I had the regular gumbo and also the seafood gumbo and both are pretty good. I would be willing to get them again but I think I prefer a darker roux. I did have a cool hurricane dream is yellow and blue little smoke coming out of the top. The rice was fresh as well with the gumbos. Absolutely terrible picture outside, as I got both cups to go. They were very busy the past few nights and should probably say something about their food."

It looked like they had some decent beer on tap too, but I got mine to go. In fact I called while in line, ordered, then went and had a beer at Chuy's while waiting to pickup my order.",,

I love Hattie B's",,

7aOljPcY6__WJTzpEaSvjg,,"Sat at the bar, had a good time with the shuckers. A lot better than just sittin at the table. 

Loved the raw/grilled oysters, but out of all the typical creole dishes the jambalaya is the best thing; everything else was just ok compared to other places I've been or even what I cook.",
7aWABIK-ypvZiERlnWVKlw,,Saturday night after the parade was over and we were soaking wet we decided to go to have dinner here. I ordered some raw oyster and some chargrilled as well they were really good only complaint I would have it's that sometimes u get a lot of the shell on some oysters tot. However they both tasted really good after that we ordered some seafood gumbo which was outstanding and also the shrimp etouffe with the crawfish tails it was delicious I'm not gonna lie the Acme gets it right all the time the ambiance it's so good and of course you can go and walk the FQ after a great meal what else can you ask for? Go and enjoy some delicious food cooked New Orleans style and let the good times roll!!!,
7aZ7xKhHnD68s7pUH7TKmQ,,"First restaurant we stopped at in our trip to New Orleans. Our uber driver recommended this place and we decided to try this despite the long line outside. 

The chargrilled oyster is so delicious that I can eat 3 dozens alone. The oyster is not as big as in the peak season but still the quality is great. We also tried the fried oyster - great but not as good as the chargrilled ones.

Would recommend everyone to visit this place if you are in NOLA.",
7amhuurGYC1KhpSWG77z-w,,"This is one of those places that's popular for the sake of popularity. I'm not a big oyster fan anyway, so my expectations are pretty low. Since this place is a volume business, tables are cramped, floors are sticky, and the place feels claustrophobic. The oisters are gritty and nothing special. There are three or four franchises now, and one of the newer ones might be better, but honestly . . . Eat oisters at home or find a proper seafood restaurant.",
7avwDUTHGR-TWVPDDpG5pg,,,A young man working at Walgreens in the French Quarters suggested Oceana. We a had a short wait and our fabulous server was Mr. David! His energy was contagious and our food came out quickly:) I had a cup of delicious seafood gumbo and the catfish platter. Everything on the platter was delicious and not bland.
7b1r84tnEEK-XY5UIplTaQ,Don't be scared by the line moves pretty quick. Great fried chicken! Staff was super nice and entertaining. Once we ordered food came out pretty fast. If you are in a hurry call ahead and pick up to avoid the line.,,
7b6YP63QFK3zyky3ti4B9g,,,Hands down best French toast I've ever had! Great service at Oceana!! Our server Whitney was amazing! She gave us some tips for first timer New Orleans visitors.

The server Darrick was very knowledgeable of the menu and recommended the perfect dishes. He even helped score us a couple jars of the dilly beans since we went a little nuts for them lol
Overall the food was fantastic, especially the rice & beans, jambalaya, and the crab cakes!!!
We will definitely be back!"
7b_J1f8OfpgcJbFaxaBNog,"People try to compare this to chick fil a but it's completely different 
Both are very good 

The seasoning for their chicken is TASTY. It's not just ""hot"" but it actually has really good flavor to it 

I've gotten their fried before and even their grilled chicken is incredibly moist and flavorful. 

Why doesn't get talked as much about is their desserts
HIGHLY recommend their banana pudding!! It's such a classic and perfect way to end a southern fried chicken meal",,
7bxg6nJ2DPc0xA20CLhjhQ,"On our road trip through Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio, we had our fair share of fried chicken. Let's say we were on a mission and didn't mind the extra ten pounds since it was the dead middle of winter. 
Of the dozen or so really highly-recommended chicken places, Hattie B's takes a smooth second (only to the original Gus's.) 
Maybe if the line hadn't been so unbelievable, she would have crept into first. 
The chicken is of course juicy and crunchy and all the things really great chicken should be. It's a little terrifying to look at the amount of grease that the piece of bread under the chicken absorbed, but hey, if we were that worried about grease we wouldn't be here, right?
The choice in the level of spice is really fantastic, since my husband prefers to light his mouth on fire rather than taste his food, and even just the medium was singe-y for me.
The sides were good, not particularly remarkable, although the fries were better-than-standard. 
I would recommend planning to park far away and walk a few blocks (there are basically three parking spots for the hundred people trying to get in,) and unless you enjoy eating on top of strangers or standing up, plan on take-out. Oh, and the line... bring a snack to get through the  hour you will be standing outside... maybe a beer too.",,
7c5AMA1LhHzA59A_Th_KXA,,,Superb grilled oysters with a killer sauce. Get the full dozen... Blackened chicken very good. Fries above average. Service friendly and very prompt.
7c5lbwa4NvHk_PeiG_trBQ,,,Food was very good and so was the service. We were seated on the third floor which was cool but could be inconvenient if you have someone that has a hard time with stairs. Try the crab cakes!
7cDhfvTSH1wTxEmXMj_ChQ,,I love this place. I wish my stay was longer so I could visit it again. The food is awesome. I will definitely go back if I am to visit New Orleans again. Be prepared for the long waiting list.,
7cLmtcGEqcTdUtHUc9iUKQ,Stopped here since the reviews exceeded 10K and I wanted to see what all the hype is about for myself. The staff was welcoming and friendly and the service was okay. The food did not meet up to all the raving critiques. All the food was okay-nothing amazing. My unsweetened great. Four stars since my party enjoyed their meals.,,
7cxJG_2vCHjQpHcMlAnwaQ,,,I had the fried seafood platter and it was ok. It was nothing to brag about. The redfish and dressing was delicious. The atmosphere was casual and family friendly.

It moved fast though.. we got our food about an hour later and it was worth everything but of it! You will not be disappointed.. I had the half bird with one piece damn hot and the other shut the cluck up.. I finished the damn hot but still haven't gotten to other because it's HOT! I LOVE HOT STUFF... and it was still a little spicy for me!! But GOOD!!! And oh the peach cobbler... is to die for...,,
7dpet5PHw22hYwn6WvOeqg,,,Authentic Luisana dishes and great service... Whitney P was beyond attentive and courteous!!!
7e5j6ayCxpO840QabbNKyw,,,Service was quick and friendly. Seafood gumbo and crab cakes were great. Crab cakes had a bit of a kick. Staff there were very attentive.
7eTsK7T4VNQIkHqgLJIw6g,,"A can't miss eatery in New Orleans close to everything.

They are famous for the grilled oysters.

I'm not a fan of raw oysters, but grill them up and I am in. Orders come out pretty quickly in the bustling, casual dining area.

Lines can run down the block and they don't take reservations. Best bet is to come a little early or late,and don't worry if there's still a bit of a line. It does move quick.

We decided to show up early, sample the grilled oysters and then wander to another place to munch some more.",
7f00YaAF97mJVifIJ558rA,,,"I wish I could separate the stars! Let's just say FIVE stars for our server MICHON. She was outstanding and attentive. Our drinks never were empty never had to ask. She knew the menu and recommended a few things. The food well fair. Nothing I'd slap my mama for. My daughter just wanted a grilled piece of tuna. Well it was rare which is the way we all like it but it have no flavor except one. Fishy! So it wasn't as fresh as we had hoped. I had BBQ shrimp and it was my fourth restaurant to try it and this one came in third out of the four. Not spicy enough and the sauce was odd to say the least. Wasn't BBQ looked like a rue dark. The bread was pretty good. Also had shrimp fettuccini. Again nothing that said wow! Hubby had a good shrimp poboy. So at least he was happy. 
THE BEST THING WE ORDERED WAS THE GATOR BITES. TASTED LIKE CHICKEN. LOL. THEY WERE PRETTY GOOD. Whether they were real gator who knows. They were good. Lol! 

So food a 2.5 star but service was definite 5 star! Atmosphere was pretty neat. But well it was tourist food. So there ya go."
7f4F9e_C-XNo1fuJGFjnOg,"HOT CHICKEN!!!

Yes, one of my favorite foods and hattie Bs does not disappoint.  The chicken is always moist and the flavor is great.  The sides are also very good, coleslaw being my favorite.  Staff is very cool and I like the social dine in vibe.  I eat lunch here once a week.  The only complaint I have is....I never know which hot I'm getting.  One time the hot is just right for that good burn, next time it taste like what you would imagine mild being.  That being said I'll remind you it is always very good and I will continue to eat there.  See ya there.",,

7fuNi2l1Xpn77yQPfi2vfg,,"Well worth the wait! 

Tried to get in on three separate occasions but the line out the door was out of control ( that's a good thing). On our last try we decided to bite the bullet and wait. The line actually moved pretty quickly and we got in within 15 minutes. 
The oysters are excellent, as you would expect, especially the char grilled oysters. I could have eaten several dozen. The Po Boys are also a good choice, packed with seafood! 
Don't let the wait discourage you. Get in line, make some friends and you won't be disappointed.",
7g89H2VW6h7KjpoDdotiiQ,Great service and we were first in line. The wait behind us was out the door until after we left. Great food. The chicken wasn't insanely hot like they say but to each their own. Fun place overall!,,
7gC2GGXGwz6Gq_wxm8pgIQ,,,"Just finished dinner ehh. Service was really slow and the food was average. 
Everything smothered in sauce. It is loud and dark. 
We had the crab cakes which were ok. They had a crawfish mushroom type sauce. 
My husband ordered the ribs which the waitress said don't honk because we are a fish house we don't have great ribs, we do. Well not so much. They say fall off the bone but he needed a knife to get through them and they were dry with lots of sauce. 
Would recommend it or come back."
7gRyK24WvJkSFo73s4ikuQ,,"In my 3 nights in NOLA, I went twice. There was a line which even proves more than going twice meant something. The chargrilled oyster was to die for, not to say the raw version wasn't as good cause the mignonette sauce was so awesome and the oyster shucked in front of you. But somehow the cheese that becomes a buttery goodness over the chargrilled oyster made dipping the French bread a whole lot of YUM! Even my partner partook on the delicate flavor of the oyster which he never thought would like. The drinks are pretty strong but then again, it's Bourbon Street adjacent, drinks are all strong. I'd come back again if I had another day in New Orleans. It was my goodbye NOLA meal.",
7hGiFC9LwdtsqF3DnkdMtQ,"We got the three wing and the chicken tenders both with one side each. The wings had the mild seasoning and the chicken tenders had medium. I definitely think the wings were more tender and the seasoning was wonderful. It had a great tang to it.  The medium was spicier (of course) but still pretty mild. On the medium you could no longer taste the 'tang' so I prefer the mild. For the chicken I would give it 5 stars but the sides ended up in the trash. We got coleslaw and the pimento mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was very mushy (noodles were way over cooked) and the cheese sauce, while abundant, was bland. The coleslaw was just ok - also very bland.",,
7hMvmFRKLTpFf3iAjcVCUA,I found the chicken to be a little too greasy for my taste. Nothing special about the sides either.  I think it is over hyped.  There are better places in town for hot chicken.,"Great draft beer, awesome raw oysters, and delicious fresh craw fish.  I did not even look at the menu.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Prices were reasonable.  I wish they had such a place in Nashville.  Makes me want to go back just thinking about it!",

So from personal experience and being a huge oyster fan, I ordered 2 plates but honestly got pretty sick of them after the first plate because of how huge they are.  The baked oysters with Cheese are AMAZING. So I would say try one of each!...Their bloody marys are disgusting though, and I'm obsessed with Bloody Marys!..They use gross mix and don't season it at all with horseradish.  It's worth checking out though.",

I've tried multiple places on Bourbon street but not all delivered what I was looking for, so outside of goings on the outskirts and eating where the locals would consider true NOLA food Acme was really good!

The place isn't fancy, kinda small, but the food, bar & staff and worth the 15 min wait in line.  Pam the bartender is excellent, she'll make you feel right at home. I had the ""Taste of New Orleans"" chicken & sausage gumbo, red beans and rice, chicken & sausage jambalaya & hot smoked sausage - all were really good.  My husband ordered the shrimp & fish combo but those damn hush puppies were the Delicious!

Anyway, Acme located on the corner of Iberville & Bourbon street, for us just one block from hotel.  So check it out if you are here, but the line & wait could be rather long!",

I tasted the prawns and shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce on the Alfredo was #everything! I was slightly disappointed with the creme brûlée, only because the top was not caramelized enough and the dish itself was cold. It needed a little more heat on the top and bottom. 
I would definitely dine there again and recommend"

All I wanted was raw oysters.  They were delicious.  Probably not as good as Felix's, but then again, they were $2 cheaper as well.  I wish I got more sauce, but then again, I probably could have asked for more.  

Very much of a dive bar feeling."

Also tried the 15 dozen oyster challenge, and they were all very nice about it. The manager was great, and was right there watching and laughing with me during the whole thing. However, food won that night as I left only 6 oysters on the last plate. I will conquer the challenge next time!",

I'm not a big fan of oysters, but when in Rome...

Loved them.  The raw oysters were incredibly fresh.  They were crisp and no fishy taste to speak of.  Oh, but the chargrilled ones were insanely delicious.  I'd go back for a dozen of those alone.

Of course we had to try the Peacemaker Po Boy, their signature sandwich. It's oyster and shrimp with tabasco mayo.  That too was worth the 30 min wait.  
 
We stuck to the basics and had the red beans and rice on the side.  Good, but forgettable.  It was all about the oysters.",

7mwuKPWeEW5hDZYg1pJgQA,,First timer - will always return when in NOLA ! Chargrilled Oysters! & etouffee with side of fried crawfish is the go-to!,
7myWIyT4TlYk6RVDB2b1GQ,,,"I wasn't too sure about eating here, but I'm glad we did. I came in at 2:30 on a Friday and was seated immediately. Jimika was our waitress and she was great; helpful, nice and humorous. I ordered the Mardi Gras pasta and it was great. The place itself was 3 stories and wood and brick."
7mzo8uYToyTkdl4kpAsgiQ,,"This was the first place we ate once we arrived given how everyone raves about it, but I most definitely feel it's completely over rated. 

The food was just average. The oysters were slightly larger than the east coast but not so much with the wow factor. 

In addition there's always a line outside. In hindsight, it's really not worth the wait in line. However with that said it is also one of the most popular tourist thing to do when in New Orleans, so if you're a first timer I say hey why not, go check it out. But otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it, I strongly feel there are much better options out there. Also not so gluten free friendly.",
7n0Fl_SfGXNLQwOgeC8dsw,,Got the seafood platter and oysters. Overall everything was v good. The platter had too much fried stuff for me but everything was very tasty. The hush puppies were very good. Had some corn and subtle sweetness to them.,
7n370Bodr3fsO2k9TTOMTw,,,"Oh my goodness. This place was recommended to me by a local. I'm so glad we came. Whitney, our server, gave us the best service! The food was extraordinary, and the portions very generous. Best food and service hands down since we've been here."
7n9yb8MgiGznLb2_7peMdQ,,,"Tourist Cajun food at tourist prices. Ordered the Cajun fries and gumbo and was completely let down. There was barely any sauce on the fries, and the gumbo was as generic and forgettable as anything I could get at home in Atlanta. This place is severely overblown and should not be on your list. I'd highly recommend Acme Oyster House instead."
7nCVnkTJes9ou6KePNGO2w,,"Maybe I had higher hopes for these than I should have but I was unimpressed with Acme's oysters. Were they good? Yes. Were they the BEST OYSTERS EVER? No. I had oysters the night before at Mr. Ed's Seafood House and they were just as great and they were $5 cheaper. 

My brother & I decided on here for lunch since we saw the line wrapping around the corner the night before. We stood in the line for a late lunch around 3:30pm on a Monday and were seated in less than 5 minutes. It's all about timing with these popular spots. If you come on the weekend, expect a long wait. I would recommend planning for one weekday during your trip for less wait times. Our waitress was fun & sassy. She got right to it with putting in our order of charbroiled oysters. I had the 1/2 shrimp po-boy with a cup of seafood gumbo and my brother settled on a bowl of seafood gumbo. The gumbo was DELICIOUS! I thoroughly enjoyed it. My brother thought it was tasty, served at the perfect temperature and had large chunks of crawfish & shrimp. My shrimp po-boy was good as well. It reminded me of the fish sandwiches I would get from Wendy's back in St. Croix growing up. I know it seems weird but fast food in the Caribbean taste drastically different than that in the United States. This is a compliment for them. Being that it reminded me of something so simple, it was just okay for me. Damn you St. Croix for spoiling me with great tasting food from birth. We finished up with the bread pudding. That was the most memorable part of the meal. My brother commented that he wanted to lick the bowl when we were done but decided that it would be frowned upon if he did. Our bill came up to $57.29 for 2 iced teas, a dozen chargrilled oysters, 1 bowl of gumbo, a 1/2 shrimp po-boy & cup of gumbo & a bread pudding. After tip, we spent around $66. That's where the 3 stars come in. 

You can enjoy oysters and good food here at Acme but I wouldn't recommend waiting in a long line for it. There are 50 billion restaurants in New Orleans and they all claim to have the BEST ___________ (fill in the blank). With that being said, you can find great oysters all throughout the city. I recommend befriending a local at the bar, in your hotel or your Uber driver for off-the-beaten path eateries that will give you authentic, memorable food minus the wait and the bill.",
7nMyAz_dwklRvlt2Q9smIA,Loved everything- sides and the chicken. Remember it's HOT. We went to a branch that was outside of downtown Nashville. No lines and plenty of elbow room. I would definitely go again!,,
7oD3jFKXwQJ1MhLAvy3_dQ,,"Of course we went for oysters and were not disappointed. They were the second best oysters I've had in New Orleans. The bar tenders were friendly and easy to talk to. Also had a fish I've never heard of, but it was pretty good as well. I will definitely be back.",
7oDfqyD_xVBN-5EY5IR-Ig,,,"High prices and slow service, this is where tourists go, not locals. Locals have all been here at least once, but they won't recommend it. Some of the best food in the world so don't get sucked into this place you will pay 30% more for 50% less in quality."
7p26rFDhTXlDwXtk__tKhw,,"There is so much good food to be eaten in New Orleans. It's not worth wasting your time here. The food is sub-par, greasy. Save your appetite and money and avoid this place.",
7p3q7iZTuWiv_46ESNrF9w,,,There are lots of great Restaurants in New Orleans LA and we actually went to the Oceana Grill at the recommendation of the manager of our hotel. Glad we did as food and service were outstanding. We were fortunate to get a table out in the court yard which is nice this time of the year. We had oysters and shrimp in barbeque sauce which were both very good. Errol was our waiter and was very friendly and did a great good tending to our every need. Definite recommend it at night and only wish we had found out about it sooner so we could have tired the breakfasts. Definitely will return if back in the big easy!
7p9RC5sx7UbuqPvy_05mnw,"Fun fact: this is tourist food. It's alright, but this whole hot chicken craze is a complete business invention that you're paying too much and waiting too long for.",,
7pCQ8zEUpjYpJ9LqZycKww,,,Fairly priced seafood with a great atmosphere. Friendly service!  Red fish platter etouffee with red beans and rice with jambalaya is the way to go!
7pM2nfvDmo7NTDTgxKdpHQ,,,"I came here curious to try turtle soup, but they don't offer it here anymore despite it being on the menu.

I almost left, but then the alligator bites on the appetizer menu called out to me, so I ordered it.

So glad I did! I got them blackened, and they were so delicious. I was so surprised to find them to be perfectly seasoned, incredibly tender, juicy pieces of meat.  It didn't even need the accompanying sauce.

Oh, they also had a Yelp check-in deal for a discount off the total, and service was pretty friendly!

Definitely the most delicious alligator I have ever had, probably best thing I had in the French Quarter. Would definitely come back here again."
7pPuqSmTGi_MVrZLz8jagw,"Long lines...but worth the wait! Food was fresh. The staff was extremely friendly. The recommendations made by both the staff and regular patrons, were very helpful. Hattie B's is definitely one of the restaurants at the top of list when I visit Nashville again!",,
7pY3gmWmclxL9wrBIApJWw,Fantastic spicy chicken sandwich. Even held up when ordered take out and transported to the hotel. It was still good. This spot definitely does fried chicken right!,,
7p_kHlrMEkSr55KF9SkV_Q,"The food here was soooo yummy. I got the mild heat dark meat plate with pimento Mac n cheese and greens. I don't know why some people wrote that the sides were mediocre because that was the BEST Mac n cheese I've ever had. The greens were amazing as well, and the chicken lived up to the hype. We must have picked a good time of day to go (around 5pm on a Monday) because there were only a few people in line. Will definitely go again the next time I'm in Nashville.",,
7q70ywXy7OF2LveclYp8qQ,,"I had a really bad experience here. Came to New Orleans for Southern Decadence. This was the first restaurant we eat at. I ordered a shrimp po-boy. I had a couple of big bites out of it. I thought it tasted funny, so I looked at the shrimp. They were gray. Uncooked. I have never experienced such bad food poisoning in all my life. My doctor at home said I had E. coli since everything coming out of me was green. I was sick and incapacitated for four of the five days I was in New Orleans. Since E. coli spreads easily my roommates all got sick too, but not as sick as me.  My whole trip was ruined.  I should have gone to hospital, but at the time I didn't have insurance and I didn't realize how dangerous that kind of food poisoning could be. Since that experience I always check shrimp to make sure they're white and fully cooked before I eat them. I don't imagine this is a common experience at this restaurant. It's too bad it happened to me.",
7qEqUgUNJsLg17OFs4yYlw,,"The chargrilled oysters were so delicious, everything was delicious. Norman at the oyster bar was so funny.  A little wait to be seated but was so worth it.",
7qFOpzm76bljIsRKKUIx9g,,,The food was okay. Everything is pretty greasy. I wouldn't recommend this place because half way through my meal I became ill. My boyfriend who shared part of my plate also became ill later in the day.
7qOk1bh79tEvdJ0qMu2KJQ,,"I agree with Alison B. that no trip to N.O is complete without a trip to Acme Oyster!  This place is phenomenal if you are into oysters and other miscellaneous sea creatures in shells.  

The oysters here are just phenomenal!  They are all relatively good size and they get shucked right in front of ya!  We luckily were able to get to this place on our last day here and we were not disappointed.  

Started off splitting a dozen oysters and a crawfish po-boy.  Needless to say it is hard to mess up oysters but the size of some these suckers are amazing!  Be careful when you slurp or you could choke.  The po-boy here was the best we tried down here bar none.  (Much better than the po-boy at Chartres House, which had hard bread and was dry.) The bread was nice, warm, and soft with the right amount of spicy mayo and crispy deep fried craw fish.   Makes my mouth salivate when I think about it.  

Cannot wait to make my way back to Acme Oyster the next time I make it down to New Orleans!",
7qQ3GmMf3oH18pM7uKS_Rg,"Had dinner here the other night and tried the ""hot"" large chicken order with two breasts. Also tried the mac and cheese, the cole slaw, and the banana pudding. The crust on the chicken was crispy and crunchy and the meat was moist. The dry seasoning was good but didn't punish like the wet spice some hot chicken places use. The banana pudding was a bit too sweet but it was good. My only issue with this place is the limited seating but otherwise I would stop by here again.",,
7qQSVFMM2xeOjARm15dCnw,Daum! It's that enough. This place is FIRE in all the good ways. Must see. We visited 2 x on our 3 day stay.,,
7qydZ1NJ_iSpUcrnUQ3_AQ,,This is a very casual restaurant but has great food. The gumbo in the bread bowl is the way to go. Also the fried oysters with their special sauce is amazing. They serve it with break so you can soak up the juices. Our server was very nice and the bussers were all very accommodating given we had 12 people sitting at an 8 person table. If you are looking for fresh seafood at a reasonable price and don't feel like getting all dressed up I suggest this place.,
7r0AJyflhCMOJ9DJapHkGA,,"First, I ordered s hurricane, which was really weak and the size of a Dixie cup. The seafood gumbo was mediocre at best, and served lukewarm. The crab fingers were mostly breading, with no flavor. Not impressed. I don't understand why there's a line. Maybe resting on a past reputation?",
7rLJGKOQh-FfkOlvSH-cMA,,"The chargrilled oysters were incredible.  They tasted so fresh.  This was my first time so I have no comparison.  I recommend getting the full order.  We also tried the sampler plate of etouffee, jambalaya, red beans and sausage and the shrimp and crawfish poboy.  The sampler was only ok but the poboy was great.  The spiced mayo gave it a nice taste and the bread seemed freshly baked.  The only downside was the waiter.  He didn't seem too interested in helping us nor coming back to check on us.  Maybe it's just the style of the restaurant.  I will definitely plan to come back for the oysters.",
7rOcxpbLlRmeJWy2gyFDDg,,,"Fabulous for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Our hotel recommended the Oceana for breakfast and dinner.  We went to dinner there first.  My daughter got some kind of new orleans sampler that had red beans and rice, jambalaya and shrimp etoufee and my husband got the spicy crab cakes.  The sampler was to die for.  I am very picky about red beans and rice and this was awesome.  We went back the next morning for breakfast.  I usually am not a big fan of french toast but their lost bread (french toast) is the best breakfast I have ever had.  It is definitely on our favorite list for our return to New Orleans."
7ruN_OwHgOEI2B1Yr9F2eQ,I love hot chicken and Hattie B's is some of the best hot chicken around! The pimento mac & cheese is a must! You can also get reasonably priced pitchers of beer. The atmosphere on the patio is also fun.,,
7rzap-rh2dUNshJAZNSwjw,,,"Good customer service and the food was good, lots of seafood options, the sides were tasty. I sat at the bar and bartenders were friendly and helpful when I asked for suggestions. Great location next to Bourbon St."
7s-K8rTuoM03bB9IJqQ_0A,I've tried Hattie Bs several diff times hoping to fall in love with it ! The sides always seem to disappoint me . My last visit was a huge order for work . We requested hot & mild chicken . The chicken appeared to have no spice added ! The sides were cold : ( maybe next time .... Until then I'll get my mild chicken fix from Helen's!,,
7sEAAE3GgG9DAm34nuwKLg,,,Very good blackened catfish. We were too fool to get any bread pudding but that's just an excuse to go back. Always a good choice when visiting New Orleans.
7sSUTMfeDRMJ_xECFTL75A,,"Holyyyyyyy CATS is this spot is great!!

Right off the bat, there was a line outside but one of the staff was standing outside checking people in and giving us accurate wait times! Very helpful!

Edward was our server and he was awesome in recommending everything from the drinks, his favorite food selections and plates. He was honestly incredibly kind and made sure our first time in NOLA was one to remember! 

We had the chargrilled oysters (get the full dozen, trust me), seafood etouffe, pound of crawfish, and our drinks! 


10/10 would recommend",
7sUY3SypVPTsYs56kE97eQ,,Had their raw oysters and chargrilled oysters  for our appetizers and they were deliciously fresh and tasty. For my meal I got the peace maker Po boy and it was my first Po boy in New Orleans and I will forever crave that sandwich. It is a must try!!,
7sawSVj1ChqhbnkIk4qa8g,"Lived up to the amount of reviews. Hattie B's chicken is DELICIOUS. Chicken is tender with the prefect crunchy exterior. I went with the medium heat and my husband ordered the hot. We also ordered the Pimento Mac & cheese, baked beans (my fav) & the fries. Highly recommend!!!",,
7spifO8pgvbaO-iY9r8MaA,"I wouldn't have believed a 2 hour wait for ""Nashville Hot Chicken"" would be worth it, but I was wrong!  I got the 1/2 Chicken Hot and my lips are still feeling the heat 20 minutes later!  The Black Eyed Pea Salad is to die for too!  Maybe I'll go for ""Damn Hot"" next trip, but I can't even imagine anyone eating ""Shut The Cluck Up"", and nit being hospitalized!",,
7suZQyEZM7yMMK6V_2KmpQ,,,We stop here every time we are in New Orleans! Best seafood around. Love the red snapper stuffed with crab with crawfish sauce. Perfection! Heard they have an amazing breakfast as well but have never tried it yet.
7t2qE18r3mKrXHJiz_Tigg,,,"Walking around the quarter late at night, we were headed for another restaurant that ended up being closed, and ended up finding Oceana--discovering it was rated highly, we waited in line to get in. It's a fairly big place taking advantage of the space for social distancing. 

We had the Cajun Fries and a cup of étouffée, then the bread pudding. The fries and bread pudding were memorable. 

Definitely more touristy than unique, the Oceana was totally decent and didn't break the bank"
7t7DUcaqR4lrdl5grHVk3w,,"Acme didn't really impress, but I may be spoiled by my L.A. experiences because we have AMAZING oysters out in SaMo.

Came here around 2:30pm on a Saturday and waited 40 minutes, but the line moves pretty fast. Your entire party has to be present upon seating or else they won't let your group in at all. My group almost got kicked out because half of our party of 4 was wandering the next street over looking for beignets.

Boo Fries ($4.99) - a plate of thick cut fries smothered in gravy, roast beef, and melty cheese. It's a pretty small plate for the price, but the gravy is really delicious. Did not detect any actual roast beef on it though.

Oyster Shooter ($2.99) - your typical oyster shooter with vodka and cocktail sauce. Make sure you mix the vodka and cocktail sauce together before you shoot it!

12 Chargrilled Oysters ($19.99) -the large ones are juicy and have oyster soup leftover in the shell to sop up with the white bread they serve you with. The small ones aren't really worth it but I guess you can't choose the size when ordering a full dozen.

12 Raw Oysters ($15.49) - typical large juicy oysters served with a side of cocktail sauce. Good! But I didn't think it was especially amazing or anything compared to raw oysters in L.A.

Service is slow because they're super busy, and the mood itself isn't really my style. It's dark and flashing neon lights everywhere give it a dirty bar-style feel which I think is just the theme of Bourbon Street. Also the bathrooms are small (only two stalls) and cramped.

Total came out to be $62.07. I'd probably not come back here unless I was bringing someone for the novelty of having had Acme.",
7tH8i3lwmu4kTvUcvo1ZSg,,"Chargrilled oysters were soooooooo delicious! They were still sizzling when they got to our table, and I wish I had some to eat now... drool. However, the etouffee left a lot to be desired.  It's supposed to have crawfish, but came with shrimp instead (our waiter did warn us, but we ordered it because he still suggested it over the sampler).  It wasn't nearly as flavorful as my bf and I like, just tiny shrimp in a brown sauce that looked and smelled like etouffee.  Moral of the story: stick to what made Acme famous... oysters, and lots of them!",
7tOiCsHlhEEdQM_q_Tutng,yeahs has come a lot for you too mister and your friends fun with family and family fp,,
7twmDQql3I9IuGd8sADc3g,"Hattie B's is such a cool eating establishment! The line was long but it was worth the wait. Also, the line moves pretty fast and steady. The cashier was awesome. He had such a good sense of humor. Also the chicken, even the regular (no spice) was a tad bit spicy, so be warned. We loved the macaroni and the French fries. The sweet tea was also good. Very well run! Very friendly staff even in the hustle and bustle. Everyone was nice. Make sure you add this to your trip to Nashville. I will definitely return.",,
7uLimp2foKZR_IYSTDDmxQ,Just wow. Every time I have eaten at Hatties it has been excellent. I don't have a high heat tolerance so the mild works perfect for me. All of the sides are delicious and I have zerro complaints about this place. This place definitely lives up to the standard. Personally that's hard to find around Nashville.,,
7uv7OqOisR1f6N8HBsR9nA,"Simple... No doubt the absolute best fried chicken I have ever eaten... Hot, juicy, amazing flavor and seasoning, i cant wait to come back to nashville and eat here again!!",,

Raw oysters were fine and competitively priced but cocktail sauce was lacking (thin and spiced with Tabasco instead of horseradish.  Disappointing.",
7v2lKFhhNg1cC4NyDT9kLQ,,,"The raw oysters are big but not that flavorful. But the sauces on the Rockefeller's and the Oceana's famous are insanely delicious!
The blackened bayou duck was succulent as well as the barbecued shrimps.
In the desert section, I had better crème brûlée in the past, but the caramel on top was out of this world. Just perfection."
7v8Gv-6bpSJPUGdq2RN1_g,,"The char-grilled oysters were good, but I really liked the one at Felix's better. Ordered 2lbs of boiled crawfish. My friend liked the taste of it, but it wasn't for me. 

Everyone has their own preference, this just wasn't the place for me.",
7vWZz3Zn8vFvvzhm5sbqNg,,"Many locals recommended it and also the positive reviews showed good sign. But it was overhyped for us. Drinks were warm, raw oysters were warm, had better gumbo, and better charbroiled oysters. Service was great though but unfortunately other places had better food.",
7vj1B4Gpq0lIkMQ5usJ3EQ,,,"Late night food stop after craving seafood and hearing some rave reviews from others who've visited New Orleans...
It was quite empty at 11:30pm when we walked in, so we were seated promptly. 
We ordered alligator, half fried half blackened. Oceanas famous broiled oysters, I had the seafood combo fried with added crawfish.
The food was so good, excellent seasoning! The catfish from the seafood platter was exceptional! I couldn't stop!
My friend loved the charbroiled oysters so we ordered more.
The food is excellent here! Would definitely go back! Service was good as well."
7vnBj_s2TCX4JkGdnQ08zw,,"I'd probably give this two stars except that it is inexpensive and my wife's dish was decent.  I had the Seafood Etoufee topped with fried crawfish.  The Etoufee gravy was good, but there was no seafood in the Seafood Etoufee.  It was like they substituted the the seafood with the fried crawfish instead.  Again, good flavor but a bit incomplete.  My wife ordered the New Orleans Medley which was fine.  We also ordered the Charbroiled Oysters.  Again, decent but there are better options nearby if you just want oysters.  That said, if you've already decided to go, they're still worth ordering but recommend you pass on the Etoufee unless you ask them to make sure they scoop some actual seafood on your plate.  Lastly, DO NOT order the Mint Julep.  It was terrible.  Tasted like NyQuil.  Seriously.  

One thing that to point out, we talked to a lot of drivers, bartender and other locals while in NOLA and not a single one mentioned or praised this place.  My reco is ask locals where they like to eat or ask them about recos for specific dishes.

I also think this place advertises well and they have a good location which helps build the number of reviews they get.",
7w0WTfZ5dMQEitB1_p6uRA,"Hattie B's is the best hot chicken in town, hands down. It's the perfect amount of spice, the best crispy batter, and the juiciest chicken. The fries are also killer. It's worth the wait!",,
7wF68Mk9NNYrSZmOV5iwZw,,,"Ryan, the Hilton Garden Inn - French Quarter, assistant manager recommended the Oceana first thing when I asked about dinner. He did not hesitate, which I took as a great sign.

His tip did not disappoint! 

Super cool in the middle of Conti Street, the Oceana Grill offers a varied assortment of seafood, cooked to please.

The mark of a good seafood restaurant, for me, are the raw oysters. I usually try them when I can, but only rave about them when they are awesome.

The 1/2 dozen that Megan (bartender) brought me were fresh, juicy, plump and super yummy. I ate them so fast I did not even take a picture of the presentation (empty shells have been photographed)!!

Next I had the Oceana Red Fish and oh yes! So New Orleans! Sautéed red fish with crawfish/mushroom sauce and roasted garlic mashed potatoes! 

Next....dessert anyone?"
7wJdjcAzezyNPTZZAMHr8A,I cannot begin to explain how amazing this chicken is!! I had medium and it was delicious. I recommend the mac n cheese and potato salad. Love love love!,,

7y9xossD3vSrerZsKwgLug,,For an authentic New Orleans cuisine location it doesn't get better than Acme Ouster House. As long as you know what you're walking into. Lon line out front but one of the best charred oysters ever. Make sure you order them. It's also conveniently located next to bourbon street which is where you want to be while visiting NOLA.,
7yTTO-fDfU9hsH_F0_UBIw,We used their catering for a wedding rehearsal and had a terrific experience with the service! Delivered on time. All of the food was hot and everything we ordered was there. The girl that delivered the product was very helpful. The food was excellent and we highly recommend the Mac and cheese!!,,
7ygCGfvkwmWZ2t_sTJy2bg,,,Absolutely hands down some of the best seafood I've had.  The New Orleans Oysters were outstanding.  The freshest and meatiest.  Was in New orleans for 3 days and ate here twice.  Had the fried Oyster Po Boy for lunch one day and the crab cakes for dinner another.  Both were tender juicy.  Service was excellent as well.  When I'm in New Orleans again I will definitely come back.
7ymjgHryA31FIrKsm9KyXA,,"This place is as good, but not great.   Worth checking out if your in town.  But not worth waiting 1+ hr for as most restaurants nearby offer the same menu and the food taste about the same. 

I would recommend the chargrilled oysters over raw ones.  The raw oysters aren't as great. But the grilled ones were awesome.   

Overall it's good, but not worth all the hype.",
7ytD3PFTbwwolhaUlrthjg,,Visiting from out of town. Great place to stop by. Wait staff is great. Atmosphere is nice and casual. Smells deliciously fish . Great food :),
7yuBjruAJfk0n0eTFONMSg,"Hattie B's! Give it up for the fantastically flavorful, crazy crispy, tantalizingly tender hot chicken that Miss Hattie serves up here! Like every other Nashvillian, I typically go to Prince's. Generally resorting to bringing my brother in law or dressing up like a dude myself in order to feel safe in that part of town. Well, today my love woke up and decided she wanted hot chicken. No problem honey! Only problem is, they're not open on Sundays. Ok.. So I start Yelping other hot chicken dives. Princes:closed. Boltons: closed. Damn, damn, damn. Then I came across the reviews for Hattie B's. practically the only place open on Sundays. Reviews weren't bad so we took a drive down there. Parking is the only issue I could hint negativity towards but within a minute of finding the place, we found a spot to park. Walked in, ordered mild white meat with Mac and cheese and greens. I'm a weenie when it comes to spice but I don't like it plain either. My love ordered medium. Both of us got lemonade which was self serve, and sat down in their covered patio. Waited about 15 minutes and the sweetest lady brought us our meals. I'll just assume she's Miss Hattie because she seemed so proud of the food she was serving us. Everything was perfect. The skin was so crispy and flavorful that I felt it helped steam to penetrate through the chicken in the cooking process to make it so tender and moist. Not a whisper of dryness! The spice was dead on what I was hoping for. Not bland, but not crazy. The Mac and cheese and greens were good too but the chicken, oh the chicken. I will be dreaming of it... Most definitely returning and getting my family to switch from Prince's to Hattie B's!",,
7z8SK0qqHjUYkcr35Nuu6g,,"Ummm....delicious!  Amazing and worth the wait!  Actually, we were just 2, so while the line was really long Sunday around noon, we were seated probably within 15-20 minutes at the bar.  Got raw and roasted oysters, fried crawfish tails and a side of jambalaya, as well as a bloody Mary and hurricane.  Everything was soo tasty, and it was really cool to see all the shucking right in front of you.",

8-ycEWbiKEwlE96jfyLjpA,,"This was our first meal in NOLA and it almost ruined all other meals for us, it was that good!  I'm sure the excitement had a bit to do with our enjoyment but my taste buds do not lie. 

To start, we got in line, about 7pm on a Saturday night. It was about halfway past the next restaurant down.  After about 30 minutes in line and being just a party of 2, the hostess came by and picked us out of the line and seated us at the bar!  I imagine the line would've been about another 20-30 minutes from where we were.

As we got seated, we briefly browsed the menu but already had a good idea of what to order.  We went with a half dozen fresh oysters, half dozen chargrilled oysters, the seafood etoufee, and the New Orleans Medley.

Fresh oysters were good. I'm not an oyster connoisseur and as long as there aren't any funky smells or taste, I'm happy.  These were fine. 

Chargrilled oysters were absolutely amazing. My wife and I had never had oysters like this but we were both in love with these.  Thinking about it now, I wish we got a full dozen of these instead of the fresh oysters, but that's just me. 

Seafood Etoufee was very good and flavorful as well.  It was extremely comforting and delicious considering it was very cold outside. We added the fried crawfish tails and got them on the side.  These were great as well!

New Orleans Medley was another great choice as it allowed us to try a bit of everything!  Gumbo, Jambalaya, Red beans and rice, Grilled Smoked Sausage. Everything was great!",
80AAoEHuS-R1iKzDAd4qqQ,,,"Long line and food was ok. Definitely doesn't live up to the hype. If you're on bourbon street, it's late, and you're hungry then sure settle for Oceana grill other than that I'd recommend finding other eateries NOLA has to offer"

We were only in NOLA for a quick few days and only two of them included dinnertime -- both of those dinners were spent eating Oceana food!  Not only was the food absolutely scrumptious the other thing that particularly impressed me was a gentleman (possibly the owner??) actually recognized us from the evening prior, came over and made sure everything was okay and even offered to give us a couple of drinks on the house!  That was particularly impressive that he cared about these obvious tourists and the quality of our meals and dining experience.  Bravo for him!  We plan on returning to NOLA and Oceana will definitely be our go-to dinner restaurant!"

We were not disappointed. The staff were friendly, the atmosphere was very NOLA, the place was clean and the food was excellent. 

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because we felt we waiting just a little too long for our food. We went on a Monday at 11:30 and at one point were the only ones in the place. We still waited almost half an hour for our food. My boyfriend got a shrimp Poboy, which he devoured and loved. I got the crab cake burger, which was delicious except that it was on a bun three times the size of the crab cake, overwhelming the sandwich with bread. 

Otherwise, a great experience. We may even return at some point during the course of our stay."

82dCHyU-ANOgdhxUgZsUeg,"Hattie B's Chicken is what you're looking for in Nashville Hot Chicken. Whether you're a visitor or long time resident, you should get Hattie B's for an unforgettable meal. Their juicy chicken is perfectly spiced and flavored. Every bite is just so good and it'll make you want to share it with loved ones.

If you're only moderately hungry, I recommend going with a Sm Dark Mild (touch of heat). I don't really like spicy food and can't even handle Spicy Cheetos so mild was perfect since it was just a small amount of heat. If you like to eat spicy, I wouldn't get a heat level more than ""Hot."" Don't forget to try the yummy Pimento Mac & Cheese for one of your sides! The Crinkle Cut Fries were also delicious.

I can't wait to explore Nashville more sometime to discover more good eats. I'll probably have to check out a Hattie B's Chicken location again!","Get some Boo Fries and a dozen Chargrilled Oysters.
These were pretty good, but I didn't think they were that special. I feel that these same good-tasting oysters can be ordered at other popular restaurants in NOLA. Even though I didn't get a Po' Boy here, I'd recommend getting one because I saw someone else eating one and it looked too good to pass up. I was already too full to order anything else when I saw the sandwich.

Try to come at a non-busy time because there's usually a line out the door here. It might be hard to seat a large group so maybe have a back-up restaurant to go to.
With a 20-60 minute wait, I guess this place must be that good.
Is it? I think it's a 3.4 star place.

I sat at the bar area and this was pretty cool because you get quick service and you can see the employees opening oyster shell after oyster shell. They were also pretty friendly to chat with and talk about New Orleans or something.

I didn't think it was the best experience I had in New Orleans. I liked other places like Mother's Restaurant. I don't think I'd come back to Acme Oyster House again but it is worth going to if you have never been.","I know this place has prime real estate for vast amounts of foot traffic on Bourbon St. so naturally you might think this is a tourist trap. Well, I guess it is, but that doesn't mean it's not good! Don't be scared if there's a line out the front door because it goes relatively fast. The food is pretty great if you're really hungry and don't have crazy high expectations. This central joint has the NOLA charm and flavors you might be seeking.

Yummy menu item choices are:
1) Gator Tail Bites - Marinated white meat gator tail served fried or blackened. Served with remoulade sauce. 
2) Taste of New Orleans - Creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice with smoked sausage.
3) Oyster Rockefeller - Classic sauce with spinach, smoked bacon and pernod liqueur, topped with a blend of fresh grated parmesan cheese.
4) Bananas Foster Ice Cream - Bananas Foster Ice Cream Cake

I think the highlight was the dessert so be sure to leave room for that ice cream cake!"

I also got the boo fries which were good as a novelty appetizer but couldn't eat more than 5.",
82lFD-i8DrVw65ul_I9N1A,Pimento mac and cheese is fantastic. Their SHUT YOUR CLUCKIN' MOUTH or SHUT THE CLUCK UP or whatever they're calling the hottest is legit.

He was very prompt to answer customer questions, wait lines, and place my order with the regular waitress. I would go back. I'm sure when that time comes, he won't remember me. That place is sooooooooo busy, long long long lines. They see plenty of people daily. But definitely a must stop for the thrills, chills, reputation, and good food & company :)",
83KNC4eVzr0gPAC79ZCFbA,"A staple of Nashville!  Hot chicken made right!!  Out of the 5 levels of heat I've tried levels 2-5.  As a reference point, I love spicy food and consider myself to have a high tolerance level for heat.  Level 4 I could manage but had to drink plenty of water to get thru a piece of chicken and the flavor of the crust and meat was compromised.  For me, level 3 is the perfect level of spiciness without masking flavor.  For sides, I recommend the fries which have a good seasoning on them, southern greens, and mac n cheese.  Haven't tried the bacon and cheese grits which is only available on weekend brunch hours but I'm sure I will soon enough!",,
83Ri6AVgFk0F6VNfkE1ykA,"I honestly don't see what the big deal abt this place is. This place is honestly a 3 1/2 for me. And since the sides were a little disappointing, Hattie B's Chicken is getting a 3 for me.

The line was super long and wrapped all the way outside and onto the sidewalk. Since there was a huge crowd in town for the eclipse viewing, everyone seemed to be hungry even around 10 PM -- and at the same time. 

Tip: Order online and just come pick it up. You surpass any line there is and grab your food at the counter.

Our friend said to not try the hottest spice level (shut the cluck up) they have since it's seriously hot. He can def endure spicy food, but even he said to just take it a notch down (damn hot). Even at that notch, the significant other was still dying. I tried a piece of his chicken, and boy oh boy was I in trouble. :/

He ordered the large plate in the damn hot while I ordered the small plate in a mild (?). You can see the color difference in our chicken too.

The sides we shared were as followed: baked beans, pimento mac n cheese, red skin potato salad, and black eyed pea salad.

Baked beans: It tasted just like any other baked bean side. It was a tad sweet though so maybe they have a hint of BBQ sauce or something in it. 

Pimento mac n cheese: This was the best they could muster up, and it was just an okay mac n cheese.

Red skin potato salad: This was pretty good and my 2nd rec. It could have used more seasoning imo.

Black eyed pea salad: I don't know why they called this a salad. It looked like a bunch of peas with other items in a rather liquid base. It was okay taste wise.",,
83_BOi7MjSgBado9q4ufnw,,The charbroiled oysters are amazing!!! As well as the banana foster cheesecake but I gave this place 3 stars bc of the service and ambiance.  The host that seated us was rude and they make you wait in line outside to be seated (even when it's freezing outside). Our waiter was super nice but slow and did not check on us enough. The place is super chill and laid back so I would recommend it for lunch (instead of dinner).,
83ba7PEeRllZzWDziYPvFA,,"Visited here around 3 PM on a Sunday with little wait. As soon as we walked in, I knew we had made a mistake. The place is reminiscent of a TGI Friday's and Bubba Gump Shrimp aka tourist trap with mediocre food. We went ahead and ordered a dozen raw oysters, a half dozen of chargrilled oysters and a shrimp po'boy. The raw oysters weren't great and the cooked ones just tasted like butter. Our po'boy was good. However, the service felt rushed and inattentive. Our server took our hot sauces without even telling us why she was taking them or asking if we would mind, total turn off. We found out that her shift was ending when we left, which is why she must have been in a rush, still it was completely unprofessional. Would not recommend.",
83jKnXp3hclIe9nOLNJo1A,,"The reviews do not lie: this is the best place to eat some amazing seafood in New Orleans. The line was out the door and around the block and we were told the wait would be 45 minutes, but we were actually seated in less than 25 minutes! The atmosphere is loud, fun, and clean! The staff was very polite and very, very quick. They've been open for more than a hundred years an you can tell they are used to being a packed house. The seafood gumbo was great. Moreover, the fried catfish and fried shrimp were the best thing we had all night. As a true Cajun, I can honestly say the fried catfish was the best I'd ever had! It was seasoned perfectly and just right amount of crunch in each bite! Totally worth the wait and and will be eating there again soon!",
83lK2Huqq_2jr4YUy8SUJA,,"I'm disappointed to say that this place is vastly overrated. 

We stopped here first when we visited New Orleans for the first time. It was around 3,4 pm on Saturday afternoon and the line was super long. Our bill for three totaled about $63 pre tip. We got a dozen chargrilled oysters, a large seafood etouffee, and some soup.  

The oysters were...crunchy.  There was sand in roughly half of the dozen we got.  It was overly cheesy.  The size of the oysters was vastly inconsistent. Overall...not a fan.  No one was fighting for the last oyster, you know what I'm sayin?

Soup of the day was corn/crab bisque. I was so excited to eat it because CORN AND CRAB. Got a cup and when it came..let's just say, it was fun sized. And lukewarm. And ...I forgot that there was supposed to be crab in it when I was eating it because there was no trace of crab taste (either flavor or crab pieces). 

The seafood etouffee was yummy, but also lukewarm. We added the crawfish tail and it was $17.98 for the large size. Which wasn't that large.

The bathrooms are super gross.",

Our server Fiona was very good, attentive, knowledgeable on the menu, and very professional. We ordered the cajun fries as an appetizer and they were very tasty. Then we ordered the New Orleans Tasting (something like that) which included a small portion of crawfish etouffee, red beans and jambalaya. Food was brought out quickly but cold. Taste was okay, but definitely not fresh, especially the jambalaya. My wife and I could not finish either of the samplers. Just wasn't worth it. On the positive side, the hurricane and bloody mary cocktails were well done. Three stars because of the service."

Not until you've tried their Chargrilled oysters- ohhh mahhh gooodness you do not know what you are missing if you passed this place up thinking it was a tourist trap. We had this recommended multiple times before we got to NOLA and I could not have been happier that we waited in line. It took about 20 min to get a seat- it's a not a wide restaurant but it's very deep so it's larger than it looks from the outside. They turn the table around quickly so as soon as someone walks out it's only minutes before they seat the next group. The ambiance is really nothing special, the typical bar/restaurant combo with average noise level. The service was great- she checked in on us frequently and was super friendly. So the Chargrilled Oysters were def the greatest thing we ordered, the rest of the food was good as well. I had the combo and my fav from the 3 was the jambalaya. My husband had the shrimp etouffee and that was also delicious. Please don't pass this place up- just go a little early to try and beat the crowd.",

We sat at the bar and ordered a 1/2 dozen of the chargrilled oysters to try. Neither of us are huge oyster fans but we knew we had to give them a try. Along with the oysters, I ordered the soup of the day which was crab and corn chowder while my friend ordered the oysters Rockefeller soup. Both soups were fantastic but the oysters...my god. They arrived and you could immediately smell the butter, cheese, and herbs on them. They are grilled and then covered in butter, herbs, a little oil, and Romano cheese. The oysters are served with lemon and chunks of bread soaking in the butter sauce. After ordering a 1/2 dozen, we immediately ordered another dozen and ate every single one.

I went at 10:30am on a Monday - remember they open at 11am.  There were about a dozen people there waiting outside.  I could peer into the restaurant - it is quite small.  There are very few tables and seats, and they recommend you share a table with a stranger, which is not my style.  

The food - we were the first in line and I got a piece of plain chicken because I can not really handle much spice.  My first bite was good, and the bites continued to be good, but not incredible.  I am a fried chicken fanatic, but this experience didn't leave any real satisfaction.  The chicken was huge, sure, and it's better than some of the chicken places I've been to, but it's really not worth the hype.  

It is just OK, and lovers of Hattie B's may criticize me, but it's the truth. The restaurant was crammed and the chicken, while juicy, was too rich and greasy.  The sides, mine were mac and cheese and coleslaw, weren't even that good.  The mac and cheese was a weird texture and the addition of the pimentos was not my favorite.  The coleslaw was reminiecent of a watered down cabbage salad - not a fan.  

Overall, just okay, and definitely not worth waiting hours in line for.",,

I will definitely get it every time I come to Nashville in the future. The first time I ate at the restaurant. This location is newer and does not have as much traffic as the original, but I still had to wait around 20 minutes during a weekday, which wasn't that bad. Lord only knows how long it would be on a weekend. I was famished and smashed two sandwiches, one mild and one medium (I was slightly scared to try the hot at first). The chicken was plump and juicy. The hot seasoning was complex and full of spices, escaping the trap so many other hot sauces that try to cover up their lack of depth with the heat. The sides were good, but didn't blow me out of the park like the chicken.

The second time I had Hattie Bs, I ordered Uber Eats. The quality of the food did not suffer from Uber eats so definitely recommend it in a pinch. This time around, I was more brazen and ordered the hot sandwich. It was even better than the mild or medium, and not overwhelmingly spicy. However, if you have low spice tolerance, I recommend the medium.",,

The bread was very crunchy, almost too much, and the chicken was a little dry. My sister got the Taste of New Orleans which comes with three little bowls, one of Red Beans and Rice, one of Creole Jambalaya and one of Crawfish Etouffè. This is an incredibly tasty way to try out all of the NOLA classics. My mom got the Redfish which came with a super tasty mushroom sauce. My dad ordered the Shrimp Alfredo which was less of a traditional Alfredo, and more of a cheesy sauce. He really enjoyed it, although there wasn't a whole lot of shrimp. 

Venue: This is a huge multi-level funky restaurant with unique decor and tons of seating. They have a line outside for those who didn't make a reservation.

Our server, April, was very friendly and she's definitely got upsell game - always offering to make your drink a double, add an item to your order or get a drink to go. We had the Taste of New Orleans and the crab cakes. While good, our foot was served just warm enough that we didn't feel it warranted returning to the kitchen. The non-descript dinner roll with the Taste plate was disappointing (where's that wonderful, crusty french bread?).

Service is distinctly casual. You walk in off Conti past the bar - a long, narrow, boisterous place - to be seated.  Service is quite attentive and casual and friendly.  Sort of touristy but definitely local too. Lots of locals come here (I'm from Mid-City living in Houma now).

It's especially nice to go in for dessert on a Saturday afternoon after the lunch rush is over and just relax. Desserts are good:  bread pudding is good with a rum praline sauce.  Also the creme brulee and the bourbon pecah pie.  

But I'm getting ahead of myself.  The entrees are good too :-)

What I like here: 

Redfish Oceana
Barbecued shrimp 
Crab cakes with a cream sauce (and mushrooms as I recall)
Red beans and rice
Blackened tuna

Also, their garlic potatoes are good too."
88I0REWCu_nQFflpbKTDbA,,,"Attentive and friendly service at the bar, a classy contrast to the hoopla outside.  I had two nice beers and the Oceana grilled oysters.  They were nice oysters and cooked with finesse I think, but they were drowned in far too much sauce, which had an interesting but very salty flavor.  I'd say avoid them in favor of a simpler preparation.  I also had the Taste of New Orleans plate, all of which was terrific, but especially the gumbo.  I'd get that alone next time.  All in all a very classy place in a raucous neighborhood!"
88IP8keHlnsCT4ksZNs5mw,,,I came here in the recommendation of a shop clerk. The food (red beans n rice with andouille sausage ) was great. But the service ....no. I was sat and waited for 8 minutes abs had to go tell the host no one had been by. I ordered my meal and a coke for lunch 5 minutes later I got my food but no drink.  I had to hunt down my waiter who said my bad it's on me but when I got the bill I was still charged for it.  That being said I really enjoyed the food.
88LCTIvL-URA8rmYDZ2ecg,,"I brought the whole family here with kids and seniors due to all the raves on Yelp. It was Christmas eve. I can't believe what happened.

The place is dirty. I pulled the chair myself, then there was something sticky on my finger. Disgusting. The table cloth and chairs are greasy to touch. My husband wanted to leave. It was me insisted sitting down. I was wrong.

The service is horrible. We were ignored when we told the server we were ready to order. She said tersely ""I am not ready"", and just simply turned back on us. We waited for another 20 minutes patiently, only to witness the African American waitress walked to take order from the table next to us, full of African Americans, arriving much later than our table. When I asked the server, wasn't this place first come and first serve? She shrugged with a b*tchy look ""what can you do about me?"" Unbelievably rude. Instead of trying to resolve the issue, the manager, also an African American female, ignored our complain, even tried to find all kinds of excuse for the server, and argued with me. She was next to yelling, so unprofessional. I would never patron this place again in my life. There is something wrong with the management of this restaurant. Several other Yelp reviews used the words ""awful service"". It is a serious problem of a restaurant when the inappropriate behavior of the waiter is not getting corrected by the management chain. 

If you don't mind eating at a dirty place, feeling discriminated as a minority by a whole house of African American, go try your luck here. I came from the West coast, obviously not prepared for such low quality of service, and shabby environment. 

The place is over-hyped. It is still running because of tourist-trap. Ask any locals, they frown upon coming here. I was fooled by the hotel recommendation.

Updates: my one year old got hand mouth foot disease after we ate there. The greasy highchair must be the source of infection. HORRIBLE! This place is simply not clean enough to be safe.",
89R0mC9DUwc-P1UCoh8s6w,,"Everyone else has said it and I'll say it again...get the chargrilled oysters and top them with a little chipotle Tabasco.  They were so good that my biggest regret is only ordering a half dozen.  Smothered in cheese and garlic...how could you go wrong?

My tip is to get here right at 11 when they open to avoid the lines that the other yelpers mentioned.  We were seated right away at the bar and had the best service.  The bartender was friendly and made great recommendations.  Amusingly enough, my friend who isn't adventurous about food ordered the turkey po boy and the bartender said ""no, you have to order something that is New Orleans.""  She did the roast beef po boy and jambalaya and liked everything.  I also ordered the soup of the day which was a crab and corn chowder and it was yummy but the chargrilled oysters were definitely the highlight.",

I order the dark meat, hot (spicy) chicken.  Sides were Mac-n-Cheese and Cole Slaw.  Banana pudding for dessert.

The fried chicken was moist and the skin was incredibly flavorful and so well seasoned.  It's like they took the best bbq potato chips crumpled it up, added some cayenne and made that the seasoning!  The skin was perfectly crunchy and delectable!  I did not leave one crumb!

The mac-n-cheese was just okay, typical fare.  But the cole slaw was first rate!  Banana pudding was pretty good.

My favorite thing is to get the chicken tender meal - medium spicy. Just enough spicy for amazing flavor but doesn't burn your mouth. Love dipping in ranch too! Worth the extra 50 cents for the ranch. Fries are on point.,,

I got started with the charbroiled oysters which had just the right flavor and charbroiled taste to complete the flavors.  The oysters come in a cream sauce and they are pretty big.

The first time I went, my main course was a scrumptious fish dish, and tonight I switched gears to a steak dinner with a side of Jambalaya and a sauteed veggies.  Good steak and even better Jambalaya!  Even the veggies knocked my socks off.

The one thing that kind of concerned me was it took a while for the hostess to seat the group in front of me, but it wasn't a deal breaker at all.  The location (right off Bourbon Street) is great for entertaining folks from out of town, so I say it's a winner."

I do not usually like oysters but the chargrilled ones were great! You put them on buttery french bread and they are so good!

We went here for dinner tonight and literally every employee greeted us and thanked us for being there. Every single person on our way in and out (and there were many).  Our server was Mary L., and she was great. Funny, attentive, and knew the menu well. 

I was surprised with the high quality of the food as it is a big, busy place. I had the blackened duck and it was outstanding! Others had blackened reddish etoufee, a salad with blackened shrimp, crab cakes and ribs. The bread pudding and the creek brûlée were both outstanding, so save room for dessert! 

Kudos to the staff for a job well done."

We ordered a small dark (med. hot leg and thigh) and a large dark hot that come with two legs and two thighs. For the sides we got cole slaw, pimento mac and cheese and black bean salad. Also got couple of sweet teas.

Luckily some people left right before us so we were able to find a vacant spot outside on the patio. It took about 20 minutes before the food arrived but definitely worth the wait. The flavors were spot on! Chicken crust was beautifully seasoned and the heat level was just right. The meat was incredibly moist and tender. This chicken is amazing!

The sides were also great but I have to say that Hattie B's definitely got their chicken down. I would return in a heartbeat!",,

The po-boy and fries were cold. The crab cakes (frozen) were also cold. I'm not sure why people say these are the best in New Orleans. They are clearly frozen. The gator bites were a tad warmer than everything else. The two stars are for the hostess who made the pickup easy and quick. 

Gordon Ramsey needs to come back and figure out what's going on."
8CyZmRrYSxQ9yDzkFG7SZw,"I really wanted to like this place! I didn't want to write this review but I feel like I have a duty with over 5k reviews here. It was our first time in Nashville and we were only here for one night. I saw all of the amazing reviews and just knew we had to come here.

I love this place in theory.... in practice though, not so much. The staff was really nice, the manager? owner? was very hospitable and attentive. The vibe is a chill hangout spot type, very cleanly space.

So we walk in, stand in line for about 5 minutes and then place our orders.
I order the southern sandwich with mac and a mild wing on the side. My husband orders the mild sandwich with fries. I ask if their peach cobblers are served warm, they are. Perfect, we order 2 peach cobblers a la mode. The server asks us if we'd like them to indicate that the cobblers should come out later so we have time to eat our meal first and then eat the dessert with the cobbler still warm and ice cream still cold. We love this idea, we're excited! We pay and take a seat.

The food comes out quickly enough. The mac was kind of dry, okay taste but mostly pretty bland. The chicken sandwich came out hot and fresh; it looked great! Golden, crispy, good-sized. And then I bit into it and it was the bad kind of crispy - dry, not tender or juicy at all, hard, scraped the roof of my mouth. The patty and the breading were both pretty bland, the sauce and cole slaw didn't contribute much. I try the wing and it's actually decent. Not sure if that's because it was a bone in piece or maybe the mild flavoring? I'm noticing a lot of the positive reviews are from people who ordered spicier levels, so I'm wondering if this is a place that relies on heat for flavor. My husband was even less impressed with his meal.

We let the server know we were ready for our cobblers. They come out and the portion sizes are huge! I thought this might be the saving grace. The first bite of the ice cream tasted like subpar off-brand supermarket vanilla. The cobbler... was just soggy peaches in crisp breading and syrup. I took several bites looking for the nuances in taste - cinnamon, brown sugar, butter? Nope, just syrup, not tasty at all. I knew finishing it would be a sentence to a night with an achy stomach and so I stopped eating it once I knew it wasn't going to get any better. I still had the gurgles for a few hours. My husband ate considerably more of his cobbler as he didn't want to waste food and well... he regretted it.

Overall, if I lived in the area, I MIGHT have been willing to come back and give their plates a try just because I liked everything about the place except the food lol. But being from out of town, unfortunately if I'm ever back this is a no-go for me.",,

Be sure to go early if you want to get a table.  After 5:30-6:00 p.m. a line begins to form outside.  If you are looking for ambiance, Acme may disappoint.  It is a bit of a paper plates kind of place.",

We each had a cup of Chicken & Andouille Sausage gumbo, which tasted good, but it had tiny pieces of 'debris' and no real chunks of either meat, and mostly rice. Then we received our dozen chargrilled oysters and they were superheated and overcooked. They quickly dried out as they cooled and were rubbery when chewing. We each tried two and then asked the waiter if we could have some new oysters less cooked. The manager came over with the tray of oysters and started rudely debating the degree of doneness. I always heard they were good, but my experience says no they are not. You can get much better food and service elsewhere.",

I just want to thank my mom for giving birth to me just because it blessed me with the chance to eat at this place. 
Seriously, so good. My husband and I went to another restaurant first and the service was terrible (luckily) so we stumbled (literally) upon this place. The guy handed menus to us at the door was nice so I said ""thank you"" and he said ""after you eat here you'll be thanking me again"" and he was so right.
I got the chicken Alfredo and had them make it blackened chicken and I got a double hurricane to drink ($15 for the double) my husband got the catfish platter and a double blood marry.
The chicken alfredo was honestly the best food I've ever had in my life. You know when food is so good that you have audible sighs of pleasure with every bite? Yeah, that was both of us. Our table was almost rated R. 
With our meals, and two $15 drinks our total was $76. Well worth it.
Oh and we went on a Saturday the weekend before actual Mardi Gras at about 7. No wait and our food was there in probably 10 minutes. Wow."

We had no idea this was a chain restaurant, but if you want an authentic Cajun food this is not the place to go, it is nice cause it's fast but for the stews they cook up we actually tried better.",

I had the crawfish etouffete and the seafood gumbo of the day. The food is great, but the restaurant tends to be a bit crowded. The waiting line is usually very long but the wait is worth it. It is best that you go either alone or as a couple because that way you have a better chance of getting in earlier. If I recall correctly it took me nearly half an hour to an hour to get into the restaurant. I arrived at the dinner hour though. I highly recommend this place.",

The platter had mostly fries and just a layer of mediocre fried food on the top.  The fried catfish was however very bold but only few pieces.  The taste of was small portions of mostly rice. The sausage that was served was puney and pathetic. The crawfish was pretty good however.

Got the small dark meat plate, and a chicken sandwich. Between the two, I liked the sandwich a lot more...it pulled all the flavors together with the bun, slaw, pickle, and an aoli. The chicken plate by itself seemed like it was missing something. As for sides, the mac n cheese was creamy but not the best I've ever had, the slaw was standard, and the beans were decent.

8H2c3fGdIGwf69vfw7lT-Q,"We waited 90 minutes outside just to order our food at Hattie B's. Everyone in line assured us it was ""worth the wait."" We tried to order pickup, but even the pickup wait was over an hour. Granted, it was 8 PM on a Saturday night - which I'm sure is probably one of the if not THE busiest time at this restaurant. Nevertheless, I was fully expecting the most mind blowing fried chicken experience of my life. 

After 90 minutes of waiting, once we finally ordered, the food came pretty quickly - maybe after 10-15 minutes. My boyfriend and I both ordered the ""hot"" tenders plate with pimento mac and cheese, baked beans, and potato salad. The person taking our order advised us that the ""hot"" heat level was only slightly spicier than Sriracha. As others have mentioned, be warned. Hot is HOT!! I thought my spice tolerance was fairly decent, but Hattie B's kicked my butt. After one chicken tender, I was done. Thank god for the potato salad since it was the only thing that cooled the burn. While the chicken tenders were, in fact, super spicy, the actual chicken and breading was rather soggy and lacking in other flavors. If you just want your face and lips to burn, then I suppose it is good, but I've had better fried chicken elsewhere. The sides were ok, but my favorite was the potato salad.

Overall, after spending $25 on parking and $25 on our food, I don't think Hattie B's is worth the wait. If the wait time was shorter, my review probably would have been higher, but for travelers passing through Nashville, I don't think it's worth the stop or hype.",,

Having eaten at ACME 15 years ago on my last trip to NOLA, I wanted to revisit because I had a good experience.  This was not to be the second time around. Upon entering the restaurant, there was nobody present to seat my wife and I. Assuming that they would be back eventually, after a few minutes we walked near the bar to see if there was even a free table to determine if it was worth it to wait. There was, however, a young guy who I assume was the host, very rudely TOLD us to back up and sign in for seating. I guess business is so good during Covid that they feel like the can treat people as badly as they like. Further, it appears that they are contact tracing, which is despicable.

But, if you must wait, then reward yourself with the char-grilled oysters, which are off the hook. If you look behind the bar to where the guys are shucking, you will notice that they set the really big oysters aside. Those are the ones that get char-grilled, because they shrink so much under the heat. They are the tastiest thing on the menu, and you have to get them if you never have. The rest of the food is pretty adequate New Orleans fare. Nothing surprising, and nothing that you can't get better somewhere else.",

Hahaha.  I didn't get a bite of my boyfriend's po-boy, but he said he really good, so I'll take his word for it.  For dessert we got the bread pudding and the bananas foster ice cream cake.  Both were decadent and yummy, but definitely NOT the outstanding.

The service was excellent for accomodating a group of 20 and fairly quick too!  Maybe they just wanted to go home?  Possibly.  And the location is convenient, since it's right off of Bourbon.  I really wanted to give this place a 3.5 but decided to round up because it opens til 1AM!"
8JdSeMAk6fhfCYSuH8tivg,,,Amazing food and great service! Shared the seafood platter and worth every penny. Party of 7!
8K693boL0vWEk9wuxW5MnQ,,,"This was my first time in New Orleans and ate here my first night because I saw a line and figured it should be good, and the didnt disappoint from the great service to the well made just and undeniably the best food. All I can say is this restaurant was one of my favorites and would recommend the gator bites."
8L1mOZpx7BMVTTW0-WGlEw,,"PoBoys, Oysters, gumbo everything is soo good I especially love the frozen strawberry margaritas.",
8LCum1jsoVtaJTcRTSWQPQ,,,Great service!!!! Darrick was amazing and very nice. He gave us a list of places to go to for our visit! The margaritas were great and the blackened catfish was soooo good!!!!! Will definitely visit again!!
8M1mztu2ZHS1bR0IpYJ2BQ,"Before God destroyed Sodom with a rain of hot fiery liquid death from the skies, He didn't even make an opportunity to warn the heathens.  The same can not be said for wonderful staff of Hattie B's Hot Chicken.  You are strongly advised NOT to get their hottest hot chicken a.k.a. Shut The Cluck Up.  The fact that no one that worked there has even tried it should serve as a warning to others.  What makes Shut the Cluck up so dangerous is that it is made with a Bhut Jolokia a.k.a. Ghost Chili extract in the sauce.  This my hot head friends, is the second hottest pepper in the world, just trailing behind the Trinidad Scorpion.   I think they are legally required to warn you 3 times not to get it, after that, it's your own damn fault. Wearing my balls outside my britches, I get a quarter chicken, White Meat and Shut the Cluck Up.  What is served to me is Hemoglobin Red colored fried chicken. Its coloring is like a poison dart frog, it smells like hot shaved metal shavings, and all of this combined sending one strong uniform message. ""
Please Don't Eat Me."" 

Attached to the quarter chicken with a red plastic sword are two pickle chips stacked on each other.  I ate the pickle chip that wasn't even in contact with the chicken and choke from the heat.  Just being near chicken made it spicy.  Before I lose my composure I take a huge bite into a wing.  Within seconds, I am laughing hysterically.  Sweat pours out of weird places that I didn't think had sweat glands, such as the inside of my ears.  The pain is so intense all I can do is laugh to try to keep the laryngeal edema from closing off my airway for good, ending my life on the patio of Hattie B's.  My sinuses immediately drain all over the plate like I attached a Netti Pot to a pressure washer, my skin takes on the color of a tomato bisque.  

Next to me is a nice woman that requests the tiniest of bites of my shut the cluck up chicken.  I give her 1 micron of the red chicken skin which she consumes, coughs, sweats, and proclaims that she is now having a bad day.  I shake off the hallucinations of the ghost of all the chickens I have consumed in the form of an amputee Foghorn Leghorn and voraciously dive into the enormous task of the massive chicken breast, soaked through the with satanic ghost chili sauce.     

Meanwhile, the initial bites of Shut the Cluck up had finished searing my esophagus and was getting to work mixing with my stomach acid to form a new type of chemical weapon.  It was not unlike when Sylvester the cat ate the bottle of Nitroglycerin tablets and would explode with every hiccup.  My spittle now like the acid produced by the Alien in that famous horror movie which I can't not remember the name of.  As the hot chicken moves through you, it is unlike anything I have ever experienced.  I could actually map every single inch of my GI tract with the gut wrenching pain.  I could imagine the conversations happening in my bowels.

""Hi!  I'm a Sphincter of Oddi!  What's your name?""

""Hattie B's Hot Chicken, now give me your wallet!  I've got a knife!""

After all the taste buds on my tongue had been burned off, I was able to progress through the rest of the chicken with relative ease.

Afterwards, I attended the Radiolab Live show: Apocalyptical at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.  Halfway through the show, I was on the edge of my chair as my jejunum was being gang-raped by the ghost chili.  This is what Houdini felt like when his appendix exploded from being punched, the ultimate peritonitis simulator.  Ironically, I was going through the most pain during a segment of the show about Pepto-Bismol, and at the end of which the hosts unnecessarily swig down a big glass of the pink stuff.  I thought about leaping from my seat, running on top of the hipster's heavily gelled hair in the rows ahead of me to get to the stage and down that Pepto-Bismol.  A few hours later, I would drink one and a half bottles of Pepto-Bismol to no avail. My body rejected it as if the hot chicken was saying ""Bite the pillow, I'm going in dry"".  When your time comes (usually 6-24 hours later), you will wish for death on that toilet. I came up with a plan to Macguyver a milk enema gun but was in too much pain to execute it.  Your rectum has so many more nerve endings than your mouth and all of them very much exacting their revenge.  Even my urine burned after Hattie B's.  Nothing helps to relieve this, no amount of spicy tears will make it stop.

4/5 Stars.",,
8MQ9oMLJodE86Pvm9VfFuQ,"Be still my cluckin' heart!!! Holy Nashville HOTTTTT chicken! You are LIFE! I don't think I can ever have normal fried chicken again. After ten hours in the car and an immense amount of research into the best hot chicken in Nashville I was going back in forth on a few options until I realized that Hattie B's was literally 2 blocks from our hotel. It was rainy and we were tired so we just said let's do it. And Hattie B's did not disappoint.

We seemed to get there at just the right time because we only had to wait 20 minutes or so to place our order and only another 10 or so for our yumminess to arrive. I went for a small white which included a breast and a wing along with two sides. I couldn't make up my mind what so wanted so I went for the extra side for a dollar more. Ordered the collard greens, black eyed pea salad, and the pimento Mac and cheese. The greens were cooked to perfection with a delicious smokiness and a few dashes of the spicy vinegar hit the spot. The black eyed pea salad was basically like Texas caviar. It had diced onions and peppers and was tangy and flavorful. And the Mac and cheese. Oh man! But you are here to hear about the chicken, right?! 

I initially was going with medium but at the last moment I surprised myself when ""Hot"" came out of my mouth. And I ain't mad about it! The hot was the perfect amount of heat. It was spicy and definitely got my sinuses kicking but was not overwhelming. The chicken itself was cooked to perfection. Juicy, tender. Smack your mama damn good! And the crispy!! I could not get enough! I'm already planning an actual trip to Nashville so I can literally do nothing but eat hot chicken for days!",,
8MiQ5gmZU7flWculBareOg,,,Honestly felt sick after eating here. I knew something was off about the seafood texture but I kept eating because it tasted good. It ruined my new year's and we are owed a refund on our order.
8Ml3YcG5LllQTbfyhmoELg,,,First time in NOLA and we chose this place because of the great reviews! Victoria was our sweet server and Devon surprised us with delicious pickled green beans to try. They usually go in the specialty Bloody Mary.
8NB_8ts5tdrPl3SRUNOhng,,"Had to stop by before leaving The Big Easy... The chargrilled oysters are the business! Do yourself a favor and get the dozen. You won't regret it. While you're at it, get yourself an oyster shooter as well. In fact, at $1.50, get yourself a few :) 

Don't let the line discourage you. It moves pretty quickly. And if you get a chance, sit at the bar. Those guys will have you rolling!",
8NJnSGHRXit1OPwhFoe2cg,,"Food wasn't the best, our waiter was terrible, they don't split checks and to top it off if you want to split CC pmt you can only use 3 cards and the rest must be cash, do yourself a favor and go to the Bourbon House Kensie and Jake are awesome!",
8NSR4mO7HtbRHQIv8nPiGg,,,"Great place for a true NOLA experience! Sierra was our server and she was super sweet, helpful, and genuine. MAJOR POINTS go to the blackened alligotor tails! Not the deep fried blandness the rest of the city offers, you can actually taste the gator. Thank you Oceana!"
8NjW2RsAoaIGW3NddgV6bQ,,"This place is so good we came here twice on our three day vacation. There was a line and a wait at 3:00 PM and also at 5:00 PM. In our two meals, we ordered fried crab claws, crawfish etouffee (2x), seafood gumbo (2x), soft shell crab platter, and a shrimp poboy. 

I had the etouffee both times and I can't help but think it is the quintessential example of perfect, southern comfort food. It was zesty and flavorful, buttery, but not too heavy like a lot of the etouffee in Houston. The crawfish tails were plump, juicy, and fresh (moreso the 2nd time). Overall, probably my favorite thing I ate during this trip. The soft shell crab was awesome. Melt in your mouth succulent but still meaty enough to enjoy. Mark's in Houston was running a soft shell crab dish some time go and they take some pointers from Acme. 

Shrimp po boy looked average. Seafood gumbo tasted pretty good. I only sampled both. Fried crab claws were fried crab claws. I wish I had gotten the peacemaker sandwich to go, or some oysters, but the place is not cheap at all. 

Service was awful the first time, definitely sufficient the second time. But again, I think things are a lot more laid back here. 

I like this place a lot and I would go broke eating here if I lived in New Orleans.",
8No_rEDSSVDiksDSZsTqlg,,"Wow wow wow. Where do I even start with Acme? I guess I can start by letting you know that I went two days in a row and would have gone a third if I had enough time. Also, I try to eat plant-based as much as possible, but as soon as I booked a trip to New Orleans I knew that would have to go on hold, and that was one of my best decisions to date. 

I had never had oysters before and really, there's no reason to eat them if they're not from Acme. You'll have to stand in line outside but once you're in, get ready for an experience. We ordered the charbroiled oysters, crab hush puppies, and sampler of gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans and rice (unfortunately I don't have pictures of the oysters because we inhaled them as soon as we got them). Everything was amazing, but the oysters and hush puppies were the standout for me, and what we ordered the second day. When the oysters come out, they're still bubbling from the grill (you can see them doing it if you walk to the back of the restaurant) and all of that oozy, deliciousness is just calling your name. And it's not just because it's a chargrilled oyster, because I had some from a nearby restaurant and it was nowhere near Acme's level. Honestly, I can't do them justice with words. All I can say is, if you love yourself and believe you deserve nice things (and are not allergic to seafood), plan to eat at Acme when you're in New Orleans.",
8O0nlCoXfr51CJuGFmIxjQ,,,"Right in the heart of bourbon street sits this gem. You can smell the delicious flavors while you wait outside. We had a party of six so we waited a while but with a daiquiri in your hand, time goes by quickly. The grilled oysters were quite tasty and for the main course, I had the taste of New Orleans which was a sampler of jambalaya, crawfish étouffée and red beans and rice...It was pretty tasty."
8O1ZE6CNL80bP1sp2eFU2Q,,"Totally suggest using the Chipotle Tabasco sauce on the charbroiled oysters!  Delish!! Also opt for the bar, wait time is shorter and service was quick.",

8OBgJJF-3CYIy69RLqwz3w,,"Unfortunately, I did not come here during crawfish season so I could not get my hands on their boiled crawfish. I had their baked oysters, raw oysters, and fried crawfish. Their baked oysters was mouthwatering. I wish I had more bread to wipe up the garlic sauce. The raw oysters were not cleaned well, I felt as though I ate more dirt than oysters. Nevertheless, still refreshing. The fried crawfish lacked flavor. I tasted no crawfish and only bread. I felt like I was eating fried dough. Wait time here is not horrible but the line is rather long. I will come again during crawfish season and will update my review.",
8OHKL4w2GHYAz5GHtsqJgg,,Man if you want oysters this is the place. The best oysters in New Orleans HANDS DOWN. The charbroiled oysters are top notch and my favorite. The atmosphere is pure bourbon street but nice to sit down and not terribly crazy. I would suggest to anyone in the area. WARNING: you will have to wait in line because it is such a staple to New Orleans,
8OIhplRRHtI7NF2lUA3oqg,"I'm a Nashville native and though I will say Prince's Hot Chicken is the original ""Hattie B's"", this place is still pretty damn good. I usually just get the chicken basket at hot and it doesn't disappoint. The food always hits the spot, but something that has to be said is the wait you'll have to endure if you come here during a busy weekend in Nashville, which seems about every weekend now so try to go at odd hours if you want to miss the horrid lines. Other than that, the Mac & cheese is also a good side to have and you can't go wrong with fries ever!",,
8OW1e4qFmtyzgd_ezk3WSg,,,"Came to New Orleans on vacation and heard this was a must try restaurant while I was here. Decided to come the first night here and man was I amazed! From the blackened alligator bites to the bread pudding everything was beyond satisfying. I had the Seafood Platter as a main dish and it was definitely piled high with catfish, oysters, and shrimp. All I have to say is if you come across this place it is definitely worth coming in and having a meal. Lastly, the customer service was A+++! Everyone here seems so happy and very friendly."
8ObBFLVRItaD3jxfyvGvZA,,,"Had the blackened chicken, catfish platter and the po boy and it was all AMAZING my first time in New Orleans and I will be back ! Make sure to ask for Lavern !! Very sweet and really knew the menu, great service great food"
8OeCpQ3wov638TShw9ng-Q,,,"When I think about this place I instantly remember the oyster rockefeller dozen and the rest of the food was a forgettable blur. Soooo insanely good. Cheesy, buttery, HEAVEN! Crazzyy good. Makes me so angry that I know I won't find this in Miami!

The rest of the food was not bad. But not as insanely delicious as the oysters. I had a plate of red beans and rice. I enjoyed it very much, I saw my friends gobble down cheeseburgers and a Po'boy. Which both friends attested to it being very good. Needless to say, we had a good dinner here."
8Oq_liXEhbw6Qa899mRBhg,"Definitely worth the wait in line for some fresh fried HattieB's hot chicken! I wasn't too crazy about the sides. The mac and cheese was alright, the greens were a bit bitter. But the hot chicken...amazing. So crunchy on the outside, juicy and tender meat.",,
8OspSNYKYL0RkF2mN863iw,,"Oysters were great. The po-boy was 3.5 and the red/bean, jambalaya and gumbo medley was a 2. Ambience- ok. Wouldn't come back unless it was for the oysters only.",
8OzwNTmN3IPkns1UPZM1_Q,"Excellent spot if you want to experience good Nashville hot chicken! The restaurant is small; so expect to wait in line to get in. However, the wait went by fairly quick and trust me, it's worth the wait. 

You definitely need to have your chicken HOT. It won't set your mouth on fire, but you'll feel that nice burn. The gf and I had tenders (she normal, mine hot). The tenders plus two sides is more than enough food per person. We actually weren't able to finish since we also got banana bread pudding and peach cobbler (hands down one of the best cobblers I've had). 

Our sides includes fries, Mac n cheese, potato salads and southern greens. I was relieved the greens were the classic kind I want and not some reinvention of a classic that can easily be ruined. 

Like I said, you need to visit this place. Make sure to give yourself time and enjoy the moment.",,
8PTGrFheoglwnmHEKYCRlg,Always good. The wait for the food is long but soooooo worth it. I will wait all day for fresh seasoned chicken!!,,"Great good. Not a long wait for lunch. Fries catfish  and a New Orleans sampler. 
Friendly staff. The fish was seasoned great. We would like it fried a little harder."
8Pa5z4AeKC8kr8Mvlg7zCg,,"Chargrilled Oysters... do it. They are sooooo good! Buttery and garlicky and perfect. I do not usually eat a lot of bread, but I dipped all 4 slices of the French bread that was served with the oysters into the garlic/butter/herb goodness and enjoyed every last bite. We waited approximately 20-30 minutes on a Sunday night and sat at the bar because it was the first available. Service was good, but not great. I also ordered the crab cake plate. The crab cake was yummy- crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. The coleslaw it was served with was pretty good and the fries were just ok. When I'm back in NOLA I will return and get a dozen of the chargrilled oysters this time.",
8Pcbw_vNNJ5anl1LdOK9Ew,,,"Had a decent lunch with Grilled oysters, Gumbo, Crab Cakes and my young daughter a burger. It's situated in the French Quarter the location is excellent and the food is good, however, I did send my Seafood and Shrimp Gumbo back as it was cold? Obviously it was therefore not fresh. But this is the tourist area, not mother's cooking. I can recommend the restaurant as you will have fair food but at tourist prices."
8PmYg12cee5WiVvVwxOXCQ,"We arrived 5 minutes after they opened and the line was out the door. This place is the real deal. I got 2 piece white - hot. It was amazing! The crust was crispy  with a chili rub that made me sweat a bit. The chicken was very flavorful and moist. The greens were great and the pimento macncheese was perfect. My memphis friends will get upset with me, but I have to advise that if you want the perfect fried chicken---Hattie B's is the place to go! The best chicken I've ever eaten. Worth the wait and the drive.",,
8PnwGxXIh8OW5kSCN69PLw,,,OMG. I just had what I can honestly say was the best breakfast I've ever had.  I ordered the eggs Melezana.  It's fried eggplant with a poached egg ham and holendaze sauce. Truly nothing short of amazing. Fantastic service to boot!  It's a must.  My son ordered the Cajun breakfast and to wash great too!

Quality: 8/10
Service: 7.5/10
Ambiance/Location: 8/10
Overall: 8/10

Perhaps an unpopular opinion, but we think you could skip Hattie B's and be okay. This was our first hot chicken experience in Nashville, and it disappointed compared to the hot chicken we have in Columbus, OH. In our opinion, that should not be the case in the birth place of the hot chicken. It was good but not memorable.",,
8PvBY5sdQzp0hAO9FVFCKA,,,"This is a beautiful place for drinking and enjoying the good menu. We had Gumbo and Fried ouster. I like the Gumbo better than the fried oyster, but I personally don't like fried food so maybe because of that I didn't like it."
8Px4OPbvB19mLdxeHDot9Q,,"I am glad we visited this place early to avoid a wait.  definitely not worth a wait.  Ordered a dozen fresh.  Not bad, but sandy and dirty.  Ordered a dozen charbroiled.  A little small and dry.  We ordered some beers, some in bottles and some on tap.  The tap beer was served in tiny plastic disposable cups.  Very poor.  Even the water was a least served in a decent plastic tumbler.  The place has the ambiance and decor of a TGI Fridays.  Service was decent.  Really nothing special.  A tourist trap with mediocre food.  Had much better charbroiled oysters at Dragos and much better(and cheaper) fresh oysters at the Royal house (also much better ambiance).",
8Q0slxCU8xDAepTDbcZa2Q,A line out the front door is a good sign for good things to come. Another good sign is 1000+ reviews and 4 1/2 stars. I spotted this joint on Yelp and walked 2 miles to get there. I only had to wait 30 min in line and boy was it worth it. I got 6 wings one of each of their flavors. I ca't say anyone was my favorite because they were all good. If I had to choose it would be their hottest one. My biggest problem is that I live so far away from this place. Uhhh now I will have to do something about those late night cravings. While in line I met the nicest people who asked me to sit with them. Now that is some good old southern hospitality!,,
8Q1Gcr2G3q7XIBUSaPtVqA,,,Food was great and the wait staff was awesome. Waiter Chris was very helpful in helping to decide what to eat. If there wasn't so much to see and try out would eat here again this trip. Will return when back in New Orleans

She even let me in on an off menu tuna that they will make stuffed with crab...a total game changer.   Cooked to perfection.   

Huge thanks again to Mary..it would have been a great dinner even without her wise suggestions but instead it was a dinner that completely stood out.   The Cajun fries were to die for as well!"

2 leg thigh quarters plate , hot, with mac & cheese and blackeyed pea salad
jumbo tenders plate fried , medium, with mac & cheese and cole slaw
peach cobbler
banana pudding","Sat at the counter as they just assumed party sizes at the door (but no acknowledgement or greeting) and received the same poor servuce. The chargrilled oysters half dozen $11.99 were fine, but spend your time and money elsewhere.",

I asked for mild and it doesn't mild at all. It wasn't spicy at all, but the meat wasn't bad. I just expected the meat or the skin at least to be a little more tasty. Mac and cheese was pretty good. On the other hand, I can't say the same about the bean salad. It was sour(?!), maybe too much lemon/lime?! I have no idea, but definitely not getting that again.","$11/pound for crawfish and I don't regret it a single bit. Walked out loud and proud with 5 pounds to go because I don't got time to stand in that long line in the cold alone the day before Fat Tuesday. Definitely coming back for oysters and all that stuffs. Busy busy place! It can be also be because of Mardi Gras week. Seasoned perfectly; simple yet flavorful. Unlike all that saucy stuffs like how Boiling Crab does it out here in the California area. Needless to say, I packed 4 pounds with me back to California to give it to my boyfriend who's from NOLA. He forgot about great NOLA crawfish was until I reunited them after 12 years. (You're welcome if you're reading this, boo!) If you're wondering what happened to the other pound, I ate it all to myself once I got back to the hotel.

I was there at 11AM on Friday, just as they opened, so tghe place was empty
It was strange that they only sat a few people at a time and made the others wait outside. Not cool at all... they lost a star for this.

Wait staff: very friendly

Food Quality: I've only had oysters and the seafood gumbo.

  Seafood gumbo - decent but Royal House's was 3x better
  Raw Oysters -  very fresh gulf oysters. good flavor creamy, non-briny for gulf oysters which are really not very good if you'd had oysters from other places in the world but these were 

  Charbroiled Oysters - these are the stars! these rock, I could eat a ton of these.

We had actually just eaten, were totally full but figured seeing we were in the area we would call in our order to go and take it home to eat in a few hours.
We got the medium breast and hot dark with fries, baked beans, mac & cheese and cole slaw.  Nothing remotely impressed us....at all.  Everything certainly seemed fresh and well prepared and I didn't feel like anything lost that much quality on the drive home (we WERE stuffed but wanted to try a bite of everything before it headed into the chiller!).

Our waitress came and I asked about getting the shrimp and crab gumbo without okra in it and was told that I couldn't get it without okra. That is the main reason that I stopped into the location.

Since I was there I decided to get the Fried Shrimp Platter which was good but not what I was craving. I think that the okra should have been placed on the menu.",
8UWI-jB2uSYU4MdGvEko7w,,"Good and quick service.  They always have a long line outside, but it's well organized and it moves pretty quickly.  Hands down, the best chargrilled oysters, yummy po boys and  fantastic etoufee. Oh,  and the staff are friendlyh and attentive to your needs. I highly recommend Acme over Felix's across the street.",
8UymnRX7b7XwJ2s7vhNCew,,"No reservations and I understand there is typically a line. However I came in town during Covid. They are in Phase 2 and we were able to easily be seated. Hand sanitizer in the front and every employee is masked.  Bar seating and table tops.  Extremely casual dining. 

Our waitress was very attentive and very nice. We ordered a dozen raw oysters and they were HUGE! 
You must also try the chargrilled oysters. They are to die for!! I also had the soup of the day which was a corn bisque and it was very delicious. It could have been warmer but I ate it so fast I didn't have time to send it back. My friend who has been here several times ordered the gumbo and they just love it! 

I had to try the raw oyster shot in the menu. I mean I'm here, why not just do it. Vodka, 1 raw oyster and cocktail sauce. It wasn't bad. I'd be kicking myself in the rear later  if I didn't try it.  Something different you should maybe try. 

Acme - Definitely a French Quarter staple!  They have souvenirs if theirs your thing.",
8V0DriifK6ePvRfsugo1dw,"The line will be long, but it's worth the wait! Quick service, great food, and delicious local beer on tap. The best side to get is the banana pudding.  The mild spice is basically like getting a chicken tender, so be bold and get something such as the medium or hot style chicken. Be careful of the baked beans as they're extra spicy!  Enjoy your meal as you won't be disappointed by Hattie B's hot chicken.",,

I've had them made so many different ways, but the chargrilled oysters from Acme Oyster House is definitely one of my top 3 all time favorites! Soooooooo delicious! Soooooo fresh! And no joke... you won't be able to stop eating them once you start! Between 4 people we had 5 dozen! The fresh oysters were amazing too... but there was just something special about those chargrilled oysters. 

There was a little bit of a wait and the restaurant was filled with people, but you don't even notice or care once you start eating. The staff was extremely friendly & helpful when giving drink suggestions. And our food came out quickly... every single time we put in another order for more oysters lol. 

If you are in New Orleans you have to stop by this place!!!!",

8X7PjmPTDfUjSAtsfZX7gA,,,"I visited here during the Jazz fest and forgot to write a review. 
This place was great! It was after 11 pm when we got seated. We were treated as if these people had just started the day, still fresh. Service like that makes me come back again and again.
 The food was also superb. I had the BBQ shrimp.  Nice, big, plump, juicy shrimp. Lots of sauce for me to get all over myself. Lots of wet naps they gave me for knowing that was going to happen.
 I wish I would have written this earlier to remember more, but good food and good service. And clean. That is what you need to know"

8XIrtoZKc1K2wFnHLQ5now,"I like hot food, I like fried chicken, and I like the result of the two when they hook up in the deep fryer. 

Hatti B's serve hot chicken which is basically friend chicken that is done in such a way that the breading and chicken are both very spicy. This can be mild to Hot as Cluck, yea they named a heat level that. And be warned, Hot as Cluck will own 99 percent of hot food eaters around. I would put Damn Hot, the heat level under Hot as Cluck, slightly hotter than most 5 star Thai food around here. In fact Damn Hot makes my mouth go numb and impairs my motor skills. I prefer the Hot, which is still very warm and if I'm eating chicken and waffles I go for the medium because its in the morning and I don't want to worry about my empty stomach getting torched.

Did I say chicken and waffles? Yea, and hot chicken and waffles are better still. Get there on Sunday morning when they open, order your hot chicken and waffles and cover those suns of guns with as much Log Cabin syrup as you can stand. Epic. I love the tango of the spicy heat and the sweet Log Cabin syrup that reminds me of pancakes at my Moms except she never served it with hot chicken. :( I've always said Hatti B's hot chicken would be good, if not great, with buttermilk biscuits and I've sort of gotten irritated they wouldn't break tradition and serve it that way. I give them a pass now because that malted Belgian waffle is the perfect compliment to the best chicken in town if not the whole South. 

So why not five stars? I'm not crazy about any of their sides or the banana pudding. The pudding is good but taste pretty much like what you make from the nilla wafer box and the sides seem uninspired to me. I do like their greens though. And cmon, give me a buttermilk biscuit, heck steal the recipe from Barista Parlor, and serve those suckers during the week when I can't order the waffles. 

One more thing, don't hate the wait. Hatti B's is the Queen of hot chicken, not the Prince (get it?) and God Save the Queen. Just show up when they start their lunch service or accept the fact that your not the only one that loves great food. Folks are friendly, talk to them and be glad that Hatti B's is here!",,
8XJ7DpZhQrzxNIJDRShf5A,,,"Oceans Grill. The restaurant you can't count on in the quarter to have good food, at a great price , brought to you by great servers. 
 
The restaurant is narrow, but has multiple floors and multiple dining rooms. Both times we visited , we were seated in the 2nd floor which has good views. The decor is casual and colorful. The servers are very informative. They want you to be happy with your meal and have fun if you're visiting the area.

The food is that typical Louisiana cuisine. Po boys, seafood and rice, seafood and pasta. Seafood, seafood, seafood . They have a extensive bar menu as well, to-go cups available upon request.

The crab cakes were more bread-like than I would have preferred, but they are served with a crawfish cream sauce that was really delicious. They did the collard greens RIGHT, so I very much enjoyed that. The mashed potatoes are from red skin potatoes and are creamy and good; perfect for sopping up that crawfish cream sauce.

My second visit was a pre-drinking visit, so I had the fried catfish Po Boy, which comes with lettuce, slaw, tomato, remoulade, pickles and red onion . Delicious. The French fries were also fried a little harder than McDonalds' fast food chains fries and sprinkled with a little seasoning that reminds me of Season All. 

I'm told they are available for delivery, take out , so if you are visiting and don't want to leave your hotel, this might be a good place to visit:"

8XezE_lbvngW1TeDsKt3mA,,,"Not at all what I excepted!!!!  The Catfish Platter was filled with cold French  fries and 7 under cooked prices of fish.  The condiments portions were not comparable to the pieces of fish served. The coleslaw was bland and void of any kind of flavor. Definitely not worth 18.00. 

My next trip to the N. O. I will not spend any money at Oceana Grill."
8XlxYrch4J63VYMVyeojAA,,"Why the 4 stars? The only thing i like from this oyster place is their Charbroiled oyster that to die for and the Chef that grill my oyster was nice and very helpful also our server that also nice.

8YGcNsfWjls-dh88N8xK5g,"Never have I ever waited in line for fried chicken before.  Until Hattie B's!  And let me tell you, it was well worth it!  We came to Hattie B's about 10 minutes before they opened, and there was already a small line formed outside the door!  The line went quickly, and we got our food quickly once we ordered.

I ordered the chicken tender basket with pimento mac and cheese, collards, and fries.  I really like spice, but not gonna lie, I was a little nervous about this hot chicken so I ordered it mild.  I could've handled it a bit hotter, but overall it was super tasty!  My boyfriend ordered his medium, and he said they weren't super spicy either.  The fries were cooked to perfection and probably my favorite side item.  We loved the pimento mac and cheese and the collard greens, too.  All of it was very flavorful and delicious.

While I feel like this place may be hyped up more than anything, we did really enjoy our experience and liked the food.  I really did think the chicken would be spicier, but that was my mistake for ordering like a wimp! Overall, I would return and it was a great part of the whole Nashville experience!",,
8YSxVaD203mE_9FR4nCEVA,Chicken is very good.  I always call-in a to go order and pick it up to avoid the long line.  The sides are NOT good in my opinion.  I've been back for the chicken many times.  Enjoy!,,

Don't get intimidated by the long line outside. 10-15 minute wait max! Definitely worth the wait. I suggest when asked that you're willing to sit at first available. I ordered the char oysters and by far best ones I had in N'orleans. Also had a poboy with shrimp and fried oysters and that also exceeded my expectation. Oysters were perfectly grilled and full of flavor and not the overwhelming kind. As far as service goes, I always like to put myself in their shoes and I get it's busy but they seemed upset when I said I wasn't sure what I wanted. Don't come in here expecting smiles and hugs but definitely expect to leave with a smile from the food! 

I will definitely come back every time in town!",

Took Uber after checking they were open. Arrived to a closed restaurant with a lot of people standing around in disbelief, the same as we were.

Lines were a bit of a wait and you can't leave for a bit and come back because you'll lose your place in line, but sometimes they'll be able to seat you quicker than the line depending on your group size. When you actually see the line in front of you decreasing it doesn't seem like that long of a wait. I suggest going during non peak times, especially with Louisiana humidity",
8ZdT9aeq5KrIxVBS1bo54w,,"Slightly annoyed to give 5 stars, because I do think this is a bit of a tourist trap. Waiting 1.5hrs to get a table was only bearable because of the group of people I came with. That being said, I'am giving this restaurant 5 stars for their chargrilled oysters, which was impressive! The buttery cheesy oyster flavor was irresistible!  However, I do suspect you might be able to find something similar elsewhere, based on what I saw in other oyster restaurants in the area.

Some other noteworthy items on their menu are their seafood etouffee and seafood gumbo, which was flavorful.

Apart from the food, I really liked the decor and ambiance, which was so lively and unique; you really feel the spirit of New Orleans. Our server was also fantastic and interestingly looked a lot like the comic book character V. One thing that can be improved coming from someone sitting by the area where the plates were being put away/chucked, is to do it more carefully. It was so loud at times that it was disruptive. Despite that, it was still a good memorable experience and one of the highlights of my trip.",

Only thing I didn't like was the second time we ate there, we did a to-go order and the hostess doing the take out orders hardly acknowledged I was there. She was too busy talking and doing other stuff and I waited about 10 mins before she took my order."

I went solo prior to 11am fearing their would be a line. With the threat of storms I was about 10th in line which was great! Word is lines snake around the block. Why all the hoopla? Their hot chicken. I wasn't overhyping it in my mind for fear I wouldn't like it. 
Recommendation: The chicken sandwich...medium. Mac & Cheese and order an extra side of baked beans. All were outstanding. Their M&C is their own take on it. Pimento style. Delicious! 
Baked beans were a little on the sweeter side but they still were great. The star was of course the chicken. Juicy with some special hot sauce. People prefer their 1/2 chicken which is on the bone but the chicken on the sandwich is the same except boneless (of course). The coleslaw they put on it is crunchy and fresh. So good! Wash it down with a local brew. You're welcome. 
As I was leaving the line was pretty extensive. So get their early. Eat the chicken and enjoy!",,

I was excited not only for the mere fact of being on vacation, but all of the amazing things I have heard about food in Nola. No one lied. Most of the food we ate was phenomenal. The first place we had to go was Acme Oyster House. This was on my list of places to go because it was on Man VS Food. We sat down and started with an order of a dozen oysters.  Most of the people we were with had never tried oysters before, so this was going to be interesting.  Everyone was a trooper and tried at least one. Most didn't like them because of the texture and the taste of the ocean.  I believe oysters shouldn't taste like salt water.  These ones did.  I was not impressed by the oysters compare to other places in California and Florida that I have been to. Then we each ordered our entrees. One got a taste of New Orleans with red beans and rice, jambalaya, gumbo, and andouille sausage. Another got a shrimp and oyster po'boy. Another a turkey po'boy. I went with the boom boom shrimp.  The taste was amazing.  Spicy, but not overwhelming. Great flavors, great portions. The service was excellent.  They were a bit crazy and seems that they always have a line out the door.

Acme Oyster House is definitely an institution for New Orleans.  I've been to the great city twice and each time people from all over ask whether I've been to Acme.  Yes I have, and yes, it is fabulous.

The oysters are incredibly fresh, I had them raw, but the charbroiled ones looked amazing.    I also had the hush puppies and soft shell crab po boy, fantastic.  This meal was so good I even had to have it in the New Orleans Airport before I left.  I like to save the po boy and eat it halfway through the flight, just to make the other passengers jealous.

My business partner and I went for early dinner on day 1. Day 2, I took my wife and sales rep for early dinner...it was that good! Day 1 we ordered BarBQ shrimp as appetizer which is in a spicy lemon garlic sauce. It came with 5 medium shrimp and 2 pieces of french bread to soak up the sauce. It was AMAZING! The only problem there was more sauce than 2 pieces of bread could absorb. Thats a good thing because the main course size was large.  I ordered Redfish Tchopotoules (spelling) blackened with crawfish sauce on top of jalapeno cornbread stuffing. It came with collard greens (best ever!!!!). Every bite was fantastic...and I ate every bite even though it was double what I would normally ate. No room for dessert. Day 2 - 2 orders of BarBQ shrimp and all 4 of us wanted more.  I ordered Red Beans and Rice and lived every bite! I would order it again everyday if I could. For dessert all 4 shared the chocolate mouse cake...AMAZING! I am not a dessert fan but that has to be in my Top 5 favorites. I suggest going early because when we left both days there was a line waiting to get in and the place is 3 stories us a patio! The good thing about going early is that you can walk off the calories after dinner!"

There was a line but it moved quickly, don't let that stop you.",
8fJo_4li7-4Je6zKlLk9gA,,"Not quite sure what all the hype is about. We waited in line for about 20 min. Grilled oysters were good, but a little over cooked and over seasoned. Raw oysters on the half shell had zero taste. Service was not great... we got our oysters before our drinks. The best thing we had was the bread pudding. So good, we ordered another one. I definitely think Felix's across the street was much better.",
8fWWQG-TzAw1gVTteLxw7A,,,"Food ok, nothing spectacular.

Based on the yelp reviews, we had the crab cake and the gator tails appetizer, both were disappointing.  The shrimp etuffee was decent.  I had the special which was blackened red fish topped with shrimp in a white sauce.  It was served with some kind of cornbread hash and a side corn dish.  The gator tails and my special were stone cold.  I tried to eat it but just can't after a while.  I asked the waitress to see whether they can heat it up some.  She brought me a new special instead.

The service was good.  The food was just ok.  Don't understand the long line out front.  Out from all the meals we had in New Orleans, this one is the most disappointing one."
8fmJl_yJYP1Z5bHt2rfrjQ,,"I visit Louisiana at least once a year and this place is always a MUST have for me.  Depending on the time of day, there might be a line, but the Chargrilled Oysters are worth the wait.

I last visited on July 8th and enjoyed the great service that was given to us by our waitress Alisha.  She took care of us and we didn't have to ask for anything twice.

If I hear anyone I know is planning a visit to Nola, I always highly suggest they try this place.

Nothing fancy... just great service and great food.",

There was nothing that we ordered we didn't enjoy. 

Our server, Jessica, is a superstar. She made our visit 10x better. If you're ever there, ask for her!

8g9JNV1jr-TCoI6tw-ZNZA,"We ordered to go a large dark, a large white and a jumbo tender.  The large dark only had one leg and one back, which was only 1/2 of the order.  The top level heat was indeed very hot, even the 2nd level of heat would be too much for most people.  Other than the heat we did not taste any other seasonings.  If I had a chance I would probably try the mild or medium heat ones.  For what we just had, the unanimous opinion is this place is way overrated.",,
8gIYRItM6dbIt_piSWqBnQ,"I have been here many times. It is about the best balance of Hot Chicken you will find in Nashville. Sometimes there is a wait, but they usually process the line pretty quickly and people are generally friendly and courteous. I love really hot stuff but I can only go to the second hottest one they have and it takes me twice as long to eat it is so hot. Hot chicken is greasy by nature so if you want to save calories this would not be the place. The seasoning they use is great. I recommend this to all the tourist who love the Triple D kind of vibe they have.",,
8gMIe6ocBwUmtd3NVU0LjQ,"First time visiting Nashville and hear all about Hattie B's Hot chicken! Line was wrapped around the building but after reading the reviews I saw that the line is always wrapped around and worth the wait. Ordered the small dark chicken (leg quarter) with the hot spice level and the pimento Mac and cheese and collard greens. The chicken was really good and kind of spicy and the pimento Mac and cheese was soooo good! I could care less for the collard greens. Overall very good restaurant, will visit the location in Georgia to compare!",Open to capacity. Not that long of a wait on Saturday night. The alligator tail was so good. The fried crab claws was so good as well! The fish and shrimp was fried perfectly and the fish was very flaky. The cocktail sauce will open ALL of you senses lol.,

Got a combo medium and hot chicken 'large white' chicken plate with pimento mac & cheese plus fries. Absolutely fantastic! Hot chicken was not too hot for me. A couple of 'to go' platter orders helped share this great food with friends. 
This will be a regular stop on future Nashville trips! I highly recommend Hattie B's.",,

There is beer and un/sweet tea. The sides are all southern. We liked the collard greens, black-eyed pea salad (both vinegary), creamy cole slaw, and pimento Mac/cheese. You can't save tables. You order at the counter, then sit. There is a covered deck. Plan to wait in line. People chat so it passes the time. Wear sunglasses and a hat. There are coolers of water if you need a drink. We saw some carryouts. Buy a Hattie's T-shirt or cap. This is chicken heaven.",,

Great service though, and definitely recommend people trying this place at least once on their visit to NOLA."

Would have gone again another time, but had so many places to try on so little time."

One of those places people feel the need to go to, but isn't as great as you'd think for all the hype. And, this place as well as MANY others in the quarter, I found to have very bland seasonings on their so-called cajun dishes. Sad, I'm sure they do it because people from other parts of the country or other countries can't take the spices.",

8i6Lq4CbDTxqmb-stwCsIg,,"I personally think this place is an absolute must in New Orleans.  

The Wait:  Went on Saturday for lunch.  Was there around 1.30ish?  thinking it was a late lunch but the line was still pretty long (which I guess is a good sign).  Was told the wait would be 20 minutes for a party of two (with about 6 parties ahead of us) BUT we were seated in a little over 10.  :)  

Ambience:  Very casual.  I think would be nice for a comfortable date or a time out with friends. 

Food:  Ordered chargrilled oysters, red bean and rice and half and half fried shrimp and fish.  We ordered the coleslaw for the side.  All orders were pretty awesome.  I would never eat oysters anywhere else as I don't really like them but I had to while in New Orleans.  They were great and I would encourage non-oyster eaters to try oysters here.  They came with soft bread and the seasoning was very well done.  Really enjoyed the red bean and rice that came with sausages.  They didn't have overpowering flavor like gumbo which I liked.  The coleslaw was fresh, traditional, and tasty.  

Fried fish and shrimp were also great.  The batter was flavorful and crunchy, and the fish were flaky and still moist.  My husband (who's a serious foodie, especially of seafood) said that it was the best fried fish he's ever had.)

Service:  Very friendly and efficient.  My husband had some oyster spillage and they got him some baking soda and cloth.  Very accommodating.",

The chargrilled oysters were pretty good, but I was disappointed in the size!  It's not Acme's fault though, since every restaurant I ordered oysters in had tiny ones.  All of them were like an inch big.  Maybe not oyster season?  Oysters were lemon and buttery breadcrumb goodness.  But if I were to choose between Acme and Dragos...Dragos wins.  See my review for that soon.  Po'boys were OK.  I did love the tabasco infused mayo...wish I had asked for more!",
8kNic-R7QhDXwBmCdBUEbA,,"Oh my gosh, SO GOOD. 

My boyfriend and I arrived on Saturday at 11:45AM (right before the lunch hour) and surprise surprise there was a line. We luckily were not too far back maybe about 8 feet from the Acme Oyster House sign. We waited for about 25 mins. before being seated at the bar.

Servers/the oyster shuckers were super friendly at the bar and it was interesting to watch them shuck oysters so effortlessly. Lord knows, I would be STRUGGLIN'. 

We ordered the chargrilled oysters, soft shell crab platter, and a bowl of gumbo. All were definitely worth the wait. The soft shell crab was my favorite - seasoned perfectly and had the best crunch when bitten into. The platter comes with fries and a choice of side. We made the mistake of not noticing this detail and they defaulted to giving us hush puppies which I didn't think were that great. Make sure to pay attention and order a side you want! They were not serving raw oysters when we went. :(

Having it be our first NOLA dining experience, Acme Oyster House did not disappoint!",
8k_6Fv4BndJkmGH0v1Y0WQ,,Love it here. The service is always good. I love the oysters here raw and cooked although this last trip they were more burnt then just cooked. Gumbo is excellent I believe after my son had 3 bowls.  friends seafood platter was also very good and tasty. I recommend this place for ther oysters indeed maybe just make sure you not them know easy on the torch.,
8kqVJlimuYWNKCMP4r3w_Q,,"Chargrilled oysters completely lived up to the hype. They were so legit I cried, though most of the water in my eyes were mostly due to the burn after I slurped the first  fresh-out-of-the-grill oyster whole and not being able to feel my tongue for the next 5 min.

Tip: dip your bread in the leftover garlic butter left in the shells! AMAZING.

Service-wise, a guy who looked like Mr. T seemed to have taken my order but nothing happened while I sat at the bar for the next 10 min (not even water) until the guy next to him started taking care of my service. Mr. T also refused to smile and had a butcher face compared to the much nicer oyster shucker next to him.",
8krkSU0NCjPowlJU91ommg,"I arrived from Atlanta hearing the hubbub about Hattie B's and I wanted to give it a shot. I was used to Prince's hot chicken wanted to compare.

First and foremost, the chicken is southern fried and the flavouring is located in the skin. I had two quarters. One medium and one hot. The medium was no different than any other mild hot sauce I had. However once I bit into the meat, the flavours blended perfectly. Also, I had the hot. To me it was a blend of siriacha and habañero sauces. I love spice and heat in my foods and this did well. I was also surprised at how tender the quarters were. The meat was juicy however, the flavour was only localised in the skin.

The atmosphere at Hattie B's is great. Be prepared for a long line because the Nashville Hot Chicken craze has become a thing of pop culture.",,

I read great reviews and might had such high expectations, but left with disappointment and feeling that yelp reviews let me down (which doesn't happen very often).  What about the dessert you ask??? I would say the Whole Foods have better pecan pie hands down! So why two star??? The service wasn't too bad!"

I highly recommend this place and appreciate the friendly staff.",

Prepare yourself to wait in line, be rushed, pay too much and wish you'd ordered only grilled oysters and beer. Because nothing else is as good as it used to be. I long for the days when you could belly up to the bar on a fall Saturday and drink beer, watch football, bet on football and eat the errant oyster the shucker would dole out. Acme poboys were among the best in town. Nowadays, who knows? No one goes because too many people are there",

8pD-h427Y_aDcPxhDR7z8g,"I'll start off with this review discussing the biggest flaw that I found with Hattie B's. They don't have chicken and waffles every day. It was literally the saddest thing I had heard especially when the chicks and wafs were the headliner of all the Hattie B. gossip.

Alas, we dined anyway. And I'm truly glad that we did! Hot Chicken comes in a variety of styles, which I did not realize. I go the Southern style Tenders (~$9) which came out juicy and succulent just like I imagine Paula Dean's fingers to be. My co-diner ordered the white meat medium hot. Now, these chicken pieces required no sauce. Something to be said for the batter and the preparation. Speaking of, it is made to order! So it might take a little longer. No worries. Just grab your drink and watch the T.V.s they have mounted to the wall. ESPN and the news. Goes great with chicken. 

The decor is simple and the dining space itself isn't very big but there is a comfortable looking patio that due to cold weather we were unable and unwilling to explore. The overall ambiance is sort of outdoor picnic style with a faux picket fence and whitewash bench/tables. Only 5 or 6 tables so try to find an off time like 6 p.m. on a Monday!",,

But so worth the wait! It was about a 45 min wait to get inside. 
We got Lucky & found a seat immediately inside. But seats are limited 
We ordered 2 sm dark, one Medium & one Hot. They gave my sister an extra tender on top of her thigh because the thigh was a bit smaller. Which was awesome. Sides we got southern greens, Mac & cheese, potato salad, crinkle fries, & banana pudding
Everything was DELICIOUS! 
The chicken was so juicy! The crust had the perfect amount of crispiness and seasoning insanely flavorful. Sides were delicious! Banana pudding is always a fav of mines. 
You really get your moneys worth with the portion they give. 

If i could give them an extra star for their customer service i would. With it being this busy all the time. Everyone still has a smile on their face. Especially the older guy behind the bar possibly manager? Or owner? That bags the Togo's, helps everyone, & calls out orders. He was so friendly. A homeless guy came in & he stopped what he was doing. Grabbed him a cup of water and a togo box to box up leftovers that someone had gave him.

A local warned us and gave us some great ideas but we were struggling on what to get so we stuck with it 

The food is good 

Ribs are actually pretty great-- but if you don't mess up the ribs, they all ribs are pretty great! If you want to share get the full rack it turns out a little cheaper 

Atmosphere is kitschy quirky which makes it all work

It's a cool vibe but you can def skip it on the must see places and just go to a place with more food and less expensive"
8ra9XJLNRnPO_vkPAPgJfQ,,"Where do I begin? I first learned about Acme from the travel channel and have always wanted to go. Fourth of July weekend is busier than usual but there were still able to seat our party of two in a reasonable amount of time. My boyfriend and I ordered 1/2 dozen chargrilled oysters, red beans and rice, and a cup of gumbo. 

Their red beans and rice aren't really anything special. It's fresh and the flavors are alright and you might be able to get better at your local Popeyes Chicken. 

The seafood gumbo had good flavor but there wasn't much seafood in it.. Still yummy though.

The chargrilled oysters were absolutely amazing. They were delivered fresh and extremely hot. The cheese and sauce was blended beautifully on the oysters and they were large too! Add some smokey hot sauce and you have an artistic concoction. The flavors were so good, I dipped the bread in the remaining oyster sauce. 

Ambience was fun and active. We sat at the bar and everyone was very nice. Acme is a fun place for a great time.",
8rjDIXxyaBTRxkyJtT8qeg,,"The service was decent enough. Took a long while to get our orders and drinks. Food was decent. Worst party about it was the ""manager"" came up to us and told us there were families here so we needed to quite down when we had hardly loud and hardly cussed the entire time and been good. Would think since it's NO it'd be more open but they are strict and annoying. Probably won't come back.",
8s6RMuoMv4JzrNd_-WzrLQ,,Came here on a layover after being recommended by a coworker. We were really lucky when we arrived as there was no wait. We were immediately greeted by our server Michael and ordered our drinks while looking over the menu. He gave us great recommendations and gave us all the time we needed to make our decision. We started with chargrilled oysters which were AMAZING. We could have gotten another dozen! I also had the shrimp po boy and gumbo. The po boy was good- nothing too crazy and the gumbo was good. All in all the food was a 4 and the service was a 5. Michael was super helpful and always there when we needed something. I would definitely come back again!,
8s7WHr6Cd4GSOIibmrZ52w,,"All you need to know: grilled oysters! Need I say more????

8sCqwCOK0TArn_DBgMdarw,,,"We stopped by on a Thursday night for dinner and it was quite full. It's right off Bourbon Street so I guess that's expected. 

Not the warmest greeting at the door. We asked for a seat inside, though they also have a nice courtyard in the back. The ambiance was a little loud but that could have been just the parties that were having dinner that night. The atmosphere is nice with this red hue around you, sort of like you're in a club. They also have many clocks on the wall, each one showing time from a different city in the world (cool!).

Our server was really nice. We asked for no straws with our water and she paid attention to our request (yay!). She also gave us meal recommendations because their menu is quite large and, actually, so are their portions.

We ordered one of their specials, the red snapper pontchartrain. It was quite tasty. Especially the creamy sauce that covered it. The snapper had a blackened rub, it was nice and flaky. It also had shrimp in it which were well done. The was a side of yummy collard greens too. 

We followed this with dessert. Bread pudding with ice cream. It says a lot that the ice cream was nicer than the bread pudding. And the portion was so large that we couldn't finish it.

Overall it was an okay experience, food-wise. It's just that I believe there are better options in the French Quarter."
8sQIRSFgGbVnkbxMpHyd5w,,,"Best Food in NOLA!! I had the Oceana Red Fish, added blacken shrimp. OMG! The food was cooked to perfection. Nice size red fish that was the length of the plate. Perfect amount of cream sauce on top filled with crawfish. The mash potatoes & collard greens on the side was perfect. I ordered 2 Hurricane cocktails and they were even perfect! I'm in love with this place & I'm confident I'll be back every single trip to NOLA! Oh... The bread pudding dessert!!! 
You must order it!"
8sTWAHxwemyE13SJfY4QLg,"Chicken lovers rejoice. All this place is chicken, HOT chicken. The place is a little small for a restaurant that is busy. There can be a line literally out the door. Don't let that stop you. Their service was fast, accurate, and amazingly friendly. For all the chaos that goes on when it's busy, they hold their own and get you your food ASAP.

We love ACME and hit it the moment we get to New Orleans. During our first visit Pamela served us at the bar. Second visit, Rene' served our table. Both of these pros took excellent care of us. What did we have? Abita Amber on tap, oysters raw and chargrilled, New Orleans Medley (seafood gumbo), Fried Seafood Platter (oysters, shrimp and fried Fish) slaw. Love, LOve, LOVe, LOVE ACME Oyster House!","LATE NIGHT LIFE SAVER!
After a heavy-duty krewe day and night we revived at Oceana. When we arrived the place was packed, but friendly staff found a table and seated us right away. In minutes orders were take, drinks and food arrived."
8tG-VOcqZctOrhmhGIhsTg,,"Love this place!!! The oysters, raw and chargrilled were the bomb! Came here twice on my trip to NOLA (that's how good it was). 

First time, we ordered the raw and chargrilled oysters, oyster po-boy, seafood etoufee with the craw fish, shrimp and oyster po-boy, Rockefeller soup, and gumbo. 

Second time, got the oyster shooters. They were straight up vodka so be careful if you don't like shots. Also got the raw and chargrilled oysters and the oyster po-boy. 

Everything both times were amazing!! It is worth the wait and probably the best NOLA has to offer for an affordable decent meal.",
8tQ7B9quu7h3B88gHG4zKQ,,"Great service and amazing food. The charbroiled oysters with crab meat on top were great. They have purple haze in tap which was amazing. The red beans and rice were delicious. The alligator bites were crispy and flavorful. 

The shrimp po boy was decent so would skip that.",
8tc6qfcy_gakEWd-6yIBnw,,,Destinee our server was attentive but not annoying and pushy. The food was very good. Gator bites were delicious and tender. Crab cakes were also delicious and in an awesome sauce. Crawfish etoufee is a must and so very good. Jambalaya pasta was also good.
8tdpq4NS0rd9c0eyy9M2lA,,"It pains me to say this because this is such an institution, but I've lost some of the love here.  The oysters are still pretty good, as is the steamed seafood.  But I for sure have had better Po Boys, better Bloody Mary's, better fried seafood.  Also - count on a long wait here vs walk right in to other places for great food (see my other NOLA reviews)

I do love the old school feel inside, red checkered tablecloths, dark wood walls, classic bartop and shucking station.  

Give it a try if you've never been, but give other places further off Bourbon a try because they need your support too for what they do.",

We were doing the tourist thing and wanted to try the hot chicken that has become so famous recently. We got to Hattie B's at about 5 pm, and waited in a long line, although it didn't take that long. They move you through pretty swiftly. My husband and I shared a large dark platter with pimento Mac and cheese and southern greens. We ordered our chicken Hot. It was perfection!

8ubBK8XpGqhztb8S_gEGjA,,,"I can see why most people suggest going here if you're in the area. What a great experience. 

When you arrive at night you'll most likely see a line with at least 20 people waiting. Don't let this discourage you, it's worth it!  We waited in line for  about 20 minutes and once we were inside service was quick. We ordered drinks and food. Drinks came and not even 5 minutes later we were diving into our entrees. 

The crab cakes were incredible. The sauce just added to the seafood goodness. I got the corn casserole. I wasn't expected the burst of flavors and seasoning. It tasted amazing!  Everyone in my party loved their dishes. I have nothing bad to say about this place whatsoever."

It was actually the second Hattie B's that I've been to, the first near Broadway and John Lewis Way was about an hour wait so we went up to the one on 19th and Broadway and got in with no wait. I picked a good combo of waffles, damn hot tenders, and banana pudding. I would take it down a step or two in spicy heat. It was almost sickening hot but the waffles and pudding were my antidote. I know this because my friend tried it without them and was ill. These are some heavy Belgian waffles and thick banana pudding, both would be great alone but a necessity for hot chicken.",,

We ordered take out cause we wanted to eat at the hotel. Food didn't take too long took cook, about 15 minutes for two orders of pasta. I had the jambalaya pasta and my girlfriend had the shrimp Alfredo. Staff was friendly on the phone, we picked up our food and left. Food tasted great. Definitely have to come back here and eat at the restaurant to get a full feel of it but it should be enjoyable."

I was sitting waiting for my food when one the servers said I could not wait there for my to go order when a group of patrons right next to me were waiting for their to go order as well. The server did not say anything to them but came directly to us, and said we could not sit there. When asked why she only asked my group, she said because your kind brought the virus to America. We left immediately and will never return. I cannot believe this establishment would allow such racist comments to be made to their customers",,
8v-yD3pwuuIs0cRyb-YW7g,Good place for fried chicken! Busy and efficient.  Make sure you know how hot you want it before you order because even the mild is spicy. Loved the mac and cheese!,,
8vFpvgpKa58cOXpIlEpXMg,"Great chicken and much better than any other food nearby. I indulged several times in one week. Try to arrive before 630 or you will wait in a punishing line. Also don't come here if you're vegetarian. I like hot food and the hot level of chicken is probably your best bet, since it's definitely not mild but not numbingly it painfully hot. I also experienced their hottest level of spice (Shit the Cluck Up), which you should only eat to impress your friends or want your digestive system to hate you for the next 24 hours. Small is probably the right size but if you are two, you can split a large (even at different heat levels) which makes more economic sense. Sides were not bad, but unremarkable. The potato salad does have a good calming effect to counteract the hotness of the chicken. Decent selection of local taps but pricey beer.","I would give Acme 3.5 stars. The fresh oysters are nice and about market price. The char grilled oysters are tasty, but anything with that much butter should taste about that good. My shrimp poboy was tasty, but I could find an equally good sandwich elsewhere for cheaper. The ambience was pleasantly not fancy. The service would have been better off wasting less time checking to see how we were doing instead of making food arrive promptly.",
8vRGXGTp4LlJUx5DJXJ2_w,,,Such amazing Oyster Po Boys!  So good and such a landmark in one of my favorite cities!  Delicious crab cakes.  :)
8vcdXj8MwaidacTvFmgmng,,"Extremely excited to eat here. Sadly: long lines, rude staff and awful food.

We ordered 1/2 dozen charbroiled oysters, easily the worst I've ever had. Deanie's a few blocks away is far better. These were slimy, under-cleaned and just... gritty. The herb butter was awful as well.

I thought, fine, let's see what the rest is like.

The seafood gumbo? It was like someone had included a scoop of dirt and sand into the pot when making it. Dirty, dirty taste, like nothing I've ever had. 

The ""10 Napkin Beef' sandwich was extremely un-messy; I was looking forward to something messy and delicious - instead, it was basically a Subway sandwich. It was... fine, I guess, but almost identical to a Subway sandwich in quality.

The only reason this isn't a 1-star is that the manager was extremely, extremely helpful and friendly. The person serving me was angry, cold and distant, but the manager was caring and attentive; my partner has a nut allergy, and they were very keen to be helpful with providing for that.

I had to actually complain to the manager about the food; to her credit, she comped the whole meal (we ate barely 1/8th, it was so bad) and was overall very apologetic and friendly.

My advice; don't eat here. It's a tourist trap with absolutely lousy food. Rushed, angry, poor quality and expensive.",
8veMP-WQTFIf2rO_X6R-0A,"Being a Texas boy, I thought I had experienced the best fried chicken....... Man, was I wrong.... This was fantastic.  About the pimento mac and cheese, 6 stars and wash it all down with banana pudding..... Life does not get any better.",,

I was really wanting those chargrilled oysters and they didn't disappoint! I also got the seafood etouffe with some fried crawfish tails on the side. I tried the bf's gumbo and didn't like it as much as the etouffe. 

Third time's a charm in NOLA and Acme Oyster House!",

We ordered the charbroiled oyster. It had garlic butter with parmesan on top of the oyster. It was amazing!!!  The fish and chips were my favorite. It wasn't too breaded and the fish was soft and flaky. I can't wait to go back again!",

8xPxrYBIeI92-2tiOf4w2A,,Our family trip to New Orleans was great.  The Cajuns know how to eat.  Acme Oyster Bar has been recommended to us several times.  I believe it was a little over hyped.  The grilled oysters get 5 big stars.  Everything else was pretty good.  I did not feel it was overpriced especially given its locations.  The only big negative was they did make us wait outside in the cool for at least 30 minutes. I know their busy but that part was not a lot of fun.  Overall they get 4 stars just for the oysters alone.,
8xRPstWwX3i6H1Ir007vTQ,,,Really good food and service.  I had the blackened catfish Po Bo.   The catfish was tender and the sauce was great and the bread nice and crusty.   Kids had fun with the alligator appetizer.
8xWpIHQPHSN3kzsEgNQSwA,,Very good charbroiled oysters and the po boys were exactly what we expected. The only thing we did not like was the gumbo (they removed from bill without me asking). Can have long lines so go off hours.,

Service was fas and so professional, Ashley did a really good job.
Definitely will be coming here again."
8yCweX17e263zHXoh3DH7g,,,"The only positive was the service.  The quality and flavor was sub par.  People raved about the crab cakes, to us they were hard and not much on crab.  The ribeye was a poor cut and the blackened redfish was baked at best. Way too many other great places to eat in NOLA.  Diners beware."
8yGzF1Ap5adOoFWAwJg0_Q,"Well worth the 30 minute wait. Disclaimer: I eat spicy food all the time- adding hot sauce and jalapeños to everything I eat. I got the medium spice and was pleasantly surprised- nice amount of spice, manageable to eat. 
Chicken was juicy, crispy, and flavorful. We shared the pimento mac and cheese, greens, fries, potato salad, and baked. Out of all the sides I'd say the potato salad was the best in overall flavor. Mac and cheese was creamy and had good flavor. Greens could have been spicier, but were still delicious.
Only thing I regret is not getting more chicken. ,",,
8yoOFtOnr0zUXCXWnFdv3g,I got the mild spicy  and that was enough for my tame palate. I'll be dreaming of the Mac and cheese for many months. So gooooood.,,

Worst char grilled oysters out of three places we've tried them.  We came before 5, so wait was only about 15 minutes.  Service was fine.  I would not wait longer than that, better yet, go to one of other hundred restaurants in NOLA. Felix across the street was even better and no lines.   I'd say worst experience out of eating non stop for 4 days.",
8zNMidRa6k6MJ2aVkVY2Ww,,"I loved this place and would give it 4 stars i will explain.

First we got here and there was a line but our cab driver said it was short so we waited. We were in within 30 minutes. The thirty min yes outside sucked because it smelled like straight garbage outside. 

I got the chargrilled oysters and oh my god they were delicious. I also got the crawfish tails and they were good but I was looking for something more authentic New Orleans. I also got a side of hush puppies and they were a good side along side my oysters. My girlfriend got the Raw Oysters and said they were some of the best she has had. The prices were VERY reasonable. 

My only tiff I had with the place was they way people were seated from outside. There were many times we were jumped over, as well as other groups of two, for them to take in groups of 6-12. My thought was, if you would just sit our three sets of two then the people waiting longest wouldn't have to wait. Other than that, the food was worth the wait.",
9-ISAa4BtH5ZUUXRwo3iuQ,"Disgustingly good, and...punishing. The line-that-goes-out-the-door that you will inevitably wait in is worth it. As soon as you step inside you get hit by a nice hot blast of air that is: welcoming because it was 50 degrees outside and reminded me of home (Florida) so, it's ticked all my boxes so far. Please get the medium if you're a wimp like me, hours later I can still feel the sweet spicy tingle on my lips. It also seems like it's just hot enough for you to enjoy the juciness of the chicken, which must be farm raised its so darn tasty! It is also very rich and started kicking my GI system right away. But I was a glutton for punishment and kept returning for more abuse because the chicken tenders and chicken wings were out of this world. Okay, I think that's it. Also, the Mac n Cheese and beans were really good. There's also a scrumptious gourmet cupcake store next door.",,
9-PN5UkVKEuJNZRfkLJE8g,,"I'm just now getting around to writing reviews on a few places I visited in New Orleans a couple of months ago. Terrible, I know, but better late than never! Especially with a restaurant like Acme. I know they're an institution in NOLA, and because of the Chargrilled oysters, I can see why. Other than that, the place wasn't all that spectacular. 
The inside was cute, super loud with a cool bar area that you can sit and watch oysters being shucked, etc. We were seated at a really small table next to a large group, and I had to get up anytime someone in the larger party wanted to get up. Not ideal, but not worth complaining about.
Our server was generally nice. He recommended some beers for us to try out that ended up being delicious, and of course recommended the chargrilled oysters. These things were amazing. They came out piping hot, most of them were a good size, and the flavor was spot on. Cheesy, garlicky, buttery, sinful. We did ask for more bread to dip into the leftover sauce, because why wouldn't you. 
I also tried a cup of the seafood gumbo, which wasn't that great. It lacked that flavor punch I wanted, possibly because I had just eaten the oysters, but it was overall meh regardless. 
I'd come here for the chargrilled oysters again, a couple of beers, and call it a day.","I don't have to say it, but there are about 50 billion cajun/creole places in New Orleans, that it can be hard to pick a place to eat. Same goes for San Antonio with Mexican Food, etc. You may be sick of cajun food by your third day here, but that shouldn't stop you from going to Oceana. It was legit!
We had a larger party, so we had to wait a little while for a table. There was a small wait. The hostesses were super nice and accommodating, so we all started at the bar with drinks. When we sat down, our waiter was nice enough and thoroughly explained the menu, specials and what not. He wasn't the friendliest person, but then again we were edging closer and closer to being THAT loud and obnoxious table on account of the free flowing drinks, so I digress.
The food! The food was awesome. We started with the Oceanas Famous Oysters. They were delicious. I realized while I was in New Orleans that my favorite way to eat oysters now is chargrilled. So amazing. I ordered the fried seafood platter and split it with another person, which was the right choice after drinks and appetizers. It comes with a lot of food - freshly fried oysters, shrimp, catfish and french fries. Everything was seasoned perfectly. We also ordered dessert, which was great too! The bananas foster pie was everything it needed to be, and tasted just like a cold, ice cream version of the dish. The creme brulee was also really good.
With the myriad of options in NOLA for cajun, I'd go back and eat at Oceana, no question."
9-RPIqZ_p0O5gw3y7_baaw,"Cannot believe I waited for 90 minutes in blazing hot weather for this place. Luckily they had water stations at the front of the line! Eventually I made it in, chicken was served pretty quickly once ordered and at this point I was so hungry I stuffed it all down! I do love the hype of places though, it was definitely delicious, and glad I went! Not so sure I'd do it again though.",,
9-U-mPQdq3wwC4nEC37ppw,,,"The crab cakes were awesome. I loved the crawfish mushroom sauce they poor over the cakes, and I don't even like mushrooms. I had the fried shrimp platter for my entree with crawfish étouffée on the side. The shrimp was good, but the étouffée was great. To top off the meal, I ordered the bread pudding which was awesome! I would come back just for the dessert. And our server Eric was great. He was super friendly and so knowledgeable about the menu. I would also come back just to be served by Eric. Great experience."
9-YXwxhz4ptwSZ2rNjSjFQ,"I stopped here on my way to Texas, the parking was not good but this is the best fried chicken I have ever had hands down. I'm very picky with my fried chicken and they have perfected it for me. Crispy, juicy, spicy and heavenly flavors attack your tastebuds. The spicy Mac and cheese just adds to the plethora of amazing flavors you will experience. Only con is that because they are so good you can expect a line so if your impatient I would recommend you be patient so you don't miss out on some amazing food.",,

Manager should learn basic customer service skills!"

Since we were staying nearby we did....

It was the right move.....

As you can see by the pictures, the food and drink were BETTER than they looked!!

Amazing food (I had the sampler which had red beans and rice, crawfish etoufee and jambalaya)

My husband had the redfish etoufee which was delicious....

I had the Hurricane which was awesome and we topped off our meal with a great dessert (Oceana brownie topped with caramel  sauce and ice cream)

Delicious 

And tHe service was great and the crowd was very welcoming.....

We watched part of the Super Bowl there as well

I would recommend stopping by if you're ever in the French Quarter"

91Mo2-qrDaZsFC2zM8Yuqw,"The wait: Came on a Monday around 1:30-2pm, there was still line and it took about 30 minutes to get through it, ordered, and seated.

The food: IS AMAZING. Best meal we had in Nashville! We got a small white plate and a small dark plate, both came with 2 sides. The chicken is the KING/QUEEN here - the meat is SO juicy, SO tender, and so well flavored. We got medium spice it was just about right when it came to spiciness. It didn't taste hot at first, but built up as you kept eating, it was the perfect amount of heat. The chicken skin was fried perfectly and it was seasoned so perfectly, that it seeped through to the chicken too so that you're not just left with bland chicken within a fried skin wrapping. We also got: Baked Beans, Potato Salad, Mac 'n Cheese, and Greens. And the sides were all okay, nothing to write home about. 

The best part? Considering how much food you get and how popular this place is, they're pretty affordable for the quality of chicken you get! LOVE this place!",,
91QEgljZZAYpJfMHFtmCBQ,Hey Yelp! Add at 6th star for Hattie Bs!!!!. This place is unbelievable. Get here about 1/4 to 11 and wait in line! It's worth it.,,

91z9RokpfMdwbxkdAA3-nw,"If you've watched a Scooby Doo's episode where Scooby Doo and Shaggy snacked on a bunch of hot chili peppers and steam was coming out of their ears and noses *train whistle sound*, that's how I felt when I tried their ""Shut the cluck up"" sauce. There was even a Pirate symbol made out of 2 crossed sword in the sauce cup. I assumed they put it as a warning. The Pirate symbol did not justify how HAWT and SPICY the sauce was. I thought my arse would be breathing fire the next day. 

I have tried pretty much all of the level of spiciness in here and I liked ""Medium"" the best. I could taste all of the flavors and just enough heat of the chicken. Most of the sides were good, except the Black Eyed Peas Salad. The beans tasted too raw and too acidic for me. This was my first time trying Black Eyed Peas salad, so I wasn't sure if it supposed to taste like that. 

They have Chicken and Waffles on Sunday, y'all! Unless you like soggy waffles or pancakes, I don't recommend take it to-go. Make time for good food and sit at the patio! 

Last but not least, they have beer. Who doesn't love some good hot chicken and beer right!??

I will come back for more.

924PJEhAdbg2naw-v0RKzA,,,Def recommend this place 1000% percent! Our host Amethyst was probably the best we've had in a couple of years. Very warming and just amazing overall! We had a party of 9 and let me say we didn't have to sit around for her to come by and make sure we were ok. We will def be coming back.

92PBEhicdv17eoWLsxmaMw,"Grabbed Hattie B's to go while I was visiting Nashville this past weekend. Soooo delicious. I had been trying to do no meat and I was five months in before the lure of Hattie B's dragged me in. No regrets.

The chicken was moist (sorry for using that word) and flavorful and the skin was crispy and had the perfect amount of seasoning. I went with the mild which had a good kick without overpowering the taste of the chicken.

The pimento mac & cheese was out of this world and even the baked beans were awesome. Definitely recommend.",,
92pQkkz7Vs5Z4XA_1QQ4Mg,,This was the best place we ate the whole weekend in New Orleans...good prices for great food.  The seafood was fresh and good flavors.  The waitress named was Meg and she was great.  The atmosphere was great.  There is a wait outside to get in but so totally worth it.  I would highly recommend going!,

The service was good but my the food was not, First off it was cold. and it didn't have much flavor either surprisingly. I used to brag on Oceana but now I would recommend other places for authentic Creole Cuisines instead of here. I really think that they have fell off. It was other tables also complaining and sending food back. 
Now don't get me wrong our Server Rohman (If I spelled it correctly) was really great and went over and beyond to try to make the visit great but the food failed us, it just wasn't that good this time for us and we have been here several times before ,,,, so I don't think I'll be returning again unfortunately!"
9359MQTBKJvoORo1WTLxEw,So for all the ranting and raving I heard about this place I had to go check it out.  Food was delicious though the cold black eyed peas was new concept being cold.  The Mac and cheese was on point.  However my stomach didn't like something and been doing back flips since,,
93Fij2bg8CeZR1satYOICw,,,"Having visited New Orleans many times now, I have learned that Bourbon Street is generally not the best place to look for food. So we headed down Conti Street to see where luck would take us. A few paces later, we stumbled up Oceana. After perusing the menu posted outside, my friends and I decided to give it a shot. It was a Saturday night and there was no wait, so that was good. Although the place was pretty full. We sat near the side where they have the typical window/doors that open to the street. It was pretty loud, but that's what you come to expect in that area. The place is clean and the atmosphere is nice. 

Anyway, I ordered the Crawfish Étouffée and it was fabulous! OMG...everything about this dish was perfect. Even the rice was just right. I ate the entire thing, and it was a pretty big plate. I probably would have eaten a second bowl, or at least attempted it. Afterwards, I threw down some bread pudding that did not disappoint my taste buds. My friends all loved their entrees and they felt their portions were big.

The service was great and our waiter, Roderick, was genuinely friendly and helpful. The prices were average French Quarter prices, if you ask me. All in all, this is a good touristy place if you are in that area and want some good food. I am glad we found this place."
93dwjcTRKu15i2RFuq-akA,"Okay so I don't think Hattie Bs needs another review, but here we are!!!! Hattie Bs is a must if you're visiting Nashville, just an iconic restaurant that won't disappoint!! Try to go at off hours to avoid a long wait although just expect a wait if you're going. 

Nashville hot is a must and the Mac and cheese is decadent. You won't feel great after this meal, but that's okay!!!

You DESERVE alllllllll the fried chicken if you want it!!!",,

We got there around 3 and there was a short line. By the time we left, the line was quite long. So we were glad we got there at an off time. Our waitress was great and the food came out fast. We were seated by a group from the Bay Area and they were a blast. So we had a lot of fun and I was especially happy because the food was so tasty.","We got to Oceana right before the dinner crowd and was so glad we did. We ordered the New Orleans sampler with beans and rice, jambalaya, andouille sausage and gumbo. Very good but I prefer Acme. We also had the crawfish at two Faye which was also very good, a little pepper forward for me but still tasty. My husband had the rice and beans with fried crawfish and he loved it. The service was very good. We were seated right away. Fun atmosphere. Cajun fries were not spicy at all but what can you do? I think they might make them less spicy for tourists but the Cajun fries I've gotten at Five Guys had more flavor. All in all a very good food experience. I forgot to use my 10% discount for checking in with Yelp. That would've been nice if I remembered. Anyway, I would still recommend if you're looking for your classic New Orleans fare."
95A8l4dhpFsWVzJTYuQ_LA,,,"Not sure really what I can say at this moment as I am fuming mad. I will try to be straight across-the-board with this review. Over the last 10 years we've been to New Orleans 10 or 12 times we've  eaten at the Oceana almost every time. The food was always great as was the service. Today it was a completely different story. The steak or should I say steaks as my wife and I each ordered one. The steaks were as thick as a deck of cards and may be 2 inches longer than a deck of cards, you can see the fork in the picture to show how small the steak was, now if you've ever had dinner at Ruth's Chris or Maguires in Pensacola you know what a ribeye steak should look like. Believe it or not that steak in the picture was $29!! I thought when I saw the price it had to be an absolutely fantastic steak I couldn't have been more wrong. Here's how it went, we arrived there they were slightly busy no busier than we've ever seen, we were seated it took a waitress 10 minutes to get to us no problems so far but at this point we knew we needed to order our drinks and food and appetizer all at the same time, been through this before with other restaurants. Waitress came we gave her our full order, 20 minutes later he comes the food in this order, steaks came before the drinks, the appetizers came after the steaks, now are you picking up what I'm laying down? I fully understand that restaurants are understaffed for quality servers, cooks and managers but it kept getting worse. We have never been to the Oceana and not had a manager come up and ask us how everything was going and how our meal was, this time was the first time no manager came up, and now thinking of it I realized why. Getting our food getting our drinks getting what we paid for just seemed like we were pulling teeth every step of the way, the worst part of all of it is I know will never go back there again as it's obvious that the owner of the business does not care or he would be in there making sure to keep his reputation in great shape. I'm sure that more bad reviews will come in do to extremely poor management and ownership that must be going on there. As far as leaving a tip we love to tip so much so we have many many times had our credit card company contact us and ask us to verify because our tips are so large in this situation we did not leave a tip and I wrote on the bill about how unhappy we were with the service and the food. The ownership needs to get it together. They Brag and show pictures of NFL football players eating there my wife made a comment that if a football player would've seen the steak they put on our plates they would've laughed it right off the table. I can't tell you how upset I am mainly because I know We will never be able to go back there again. Oceana if you're going to charge $29 for a steak at least have it be bigger than what Walmart sells."

The oysters were only the appetizer for me and I already knew I'd make my way back here the next time I was in town. Simply amazing! I also had the fried soft shell crab and there is no replacement for the fresh seafood they get here every hour. The crab sent me on a voyage to the bottom of the sea where everything is beautiful and peaceful. Let me get started on the staff. I'm from Los Angeles and all I can say is: ""where the f@ck did all these extremely nice and lively people come out of?!"" It's really like out of cartoon.

Well i tried alligator blackened bites for appetizers  that where delicious but the catfish poboy was out of this world  for my main dish 

Anyone who come to New Orleans needs stop here and try the food the PoyBoys are made with great southern touch .

The only thing that could of been better was the wait time for food . It took a while to get the main courses , And I would of liked a refill on my coffee it was just taken with out me noticing and wasn't ever asked if I would like a refill 

Overall I still had a great time trying this place nice server and great food. Even tho ever place out here says they have PoyBoys they are not made the same be carful from where you choose to get them"

I suggest trying the Chargrilled Oysters and the BOOM BOOM Shrimp.

There's just so much history and culture in Nawleans and you will experience southern hospitality here.  The oysters obviously will blow your mind.  There's a full oyster bar, and you can get them fresh with lemon and hot sauce, rockafeller, or however you pleasure.  The shrimp and oyster poboys are awesome too but I got another spot in Nawleans for that.  The prices are affordable for good old southern comfort food and you seriously cannot beat the ambiance.  It's full of local history and will catch your attention as soon as you sit down, well IF you can sit down anyway...

Definitely a place I'm coming back to!"
99G0FvRcbxlQc8mWmnRLqA,"I ate here twice while visiting Nashville and truly loved it. Between the relatively quick service and very tasty chicken, Hattie B's is a definite must visit.

MENU:
The menu consists of what you would expect to find at a typical chicken place: different types of fried chicken and plenty of side options. There are multiple heat levels too, but be aware that these heat levels are true to their word. ""Hot"" actually is hot, so be warned.

PRICE:
The prices are about in line with what I would have expected to pay, maybe a bit high. Given the quality of the fried chicken and how fast the service is even when there is a line going out the door, I would say it was worth it.

FOOD:
The fried chicken is some of the best that I have had. The sides are also very good, but that is clearly not the reason to come here. The chicken is seasoned with what looks like a dry rub, fried, and then served on a slice of bread with a pickle slice or two on top. I tried medium, hot, and shut the cluck up. I don't think the heat level consistency is completely accurate because medium and hot tasted about the same (very spicy). While shut the cluck up is worth trying at least once (you can order a single chicken tender with it if you just want to try it), I would not order it again. While it is definitely spicy, there is no flavor, and the heat level tastes like all they did was dump black pepper onto the chicken. I personally preferred hot, but again, be aware that when Hattie B's says ""hot"", they mean it.

I definitely enjoyed Hattie B's and will be back. There usually is a long line out the door, but it goes fairly quickly. Come earlier in the evening (before 7 PM) to avoid the longest lines.",,
99J5SDwQ27zeETNZ9LPKsQ,,"This was my first trip to New Orleans and the chargrilled oysters would be one reason I would make New Orleans a city I would visit on a yearly basis.  The chargrilled oysters from Acme are probably one of the best things I've ever had.  We ordered 6 chargrilled and 6 raw.  The raw oysters were really good as well.  This is the first time I've ever seen oysters this big.  If you're hesitant with raw oysters, you definitely need to try the chargrilled.  It will probably change your life.

One mistake we made....we went to Acme Oyster our first night....all other oysters we ate from other places were no comparison.",
99SX3ljaydEZ0OAKFyi2AA,"Hattie B's has ruined any fried chicken for me in the future - I will never eat fried chicken again that is not hot. 

First, there is a line. Accept that. Pro tip - put your order in online before you head over, pick it up and eat it there. Despite the line, the place seems like a well oiled machine and you will get your food. 

I ordered a large white hot chicken to share with my boyfriend. The portion is HUGE. We each got a breast and a wing, some pickles, and white bread to sop up the spicy oil. My boyfriend said the spicy soaked bread was the best part... But the chicken. So flavorful, so juicy! Now I like spice. I generally ask for sides of hot sauce and I love me some hot peppers. The hot chicken was definitely hot, but still enjoyable. My BF (who has a great heat tolerance) agreed that while we could probably have eaten the damn hot, it would have just been for pride to say we did it and not enjoyment. 

We got 3 sides (two come with it and third for .50 cents more). They were definitely fine but not the star of the show. I saw other people's fries and they seemed ok but I wouldn't waste my time with that. 

To top it all off - Our total was $13.11!!!! Crazy! For the amount of food and quality... I just can't get over it. Definitely do yourself a favor and come to Hattie Bs.",,

We also ordered the Boom Boom Shrimp, which was great, but not spicy. Being our first night in New Orleans, I found it fitting to get the New Orleans Medley, which was a ""sampling of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and grilled smoked sausage."" It was fun to try each dish and we will definitely be back to try more!",
9AaD1lH1VCPlAZACrzo1mw,"It's good chicken, and really good sides (mac and cheese as well as the desserts)! Tourists line the streets so my biggest tip is to call and order ahead, then you can just walk in and pick it up. It's hard to sit there anyway since seating is limited",,

My husband and I came in for the first time today, hearing good things about the chargrilled oysters and the poboy. Helen was our waiter, without being pushy, she helped us decide what to order. She talked us in to ordering the full dozen chargrilled oysters, at first I thought she just wanted to sell more. When the oysters came I was very grateful she suggested a bigger order, she obviously has experience around this exact situation. The oysters were drenched in a garlic/butter sauce, similar to escargot. We also split the Crab Cake Maque Choux- delicious! I had the Seafood Etouffee which was incredible with fried crawfish tail on top. My husband had the poboy, he said it's the best he's ever had. In conclusion, even though this is a short trip, we will be retiring before we leave. When you come in, please order the chargrilled oysters (a full dozen) and if you can help it, get in Helen's section.",

9BI-YeiYy8YsqkbeM-jZpQ,,,"I went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. We had a 8 o'clock reservation. We arrived around 7:50. The line was down the street with people waiting to get in. We were able to walk right in and got seated immediately.

The hostess was very pleasant. She explained the menus and advised where the facilities were located. Our waitress arrived a few minutes later. She was very friendly and had a great personality.

She came over and took our drink order. A few minutes later she was back. We placed our entire order. We had the alligator bites for an appetizer, small Caesar salad, cup of gumbo, taste of New Orleans and the cajun jambalaya.

The alligator bites came out first. We chose to get half fried and half grilled. I personally preferred the grilled bites but they both were very good just a bit chewy. 

Wifey had the cup of gumbo. She said it was absolutely delicious and I had the Caesar salad. By the time the entrees were preparing to come out we were full. We chose to have them packed up to go.

We didn't eat that evening but warmed it up the next day in the hotel. I was a bit skeptical about how it would taste but it came out amazing.
The Cajun jambalaya was ""slap your momma"" good and wifey thoroughly enjoyed the taste of New Orleans. She stated the ""flavors are to die for"".

I would highly recommend this restaurant if visiting New Orleans. This is my 3rd visit here and one of my top restaurants to visit and the prices are very reasonable. This place will not disappoint. Good service, atmosphere and food. 

Tip- Make a reservation!!"
9BKpOl5GVRAGsMbei2uK-Q,,I know I know it's a tourist trap.  But huge crowds means fresh oysters too!  Most people on line were for parties larger than 4.  Tell the hostess you are only 2 and chances are good you will be seated right away!  Grilled oysters were great and lived up to the hype.  Sharp Parma cheese complimented the rich oyster very well.  The oyster poboy was also delicious!  It was obviously fresh out of the fryer and the breading was just right with a good amount of seasoning.  The delicate taste of catfish however gets a bit lost in the roll.  Raw oysters were extremely fresh so go ahead and get 18 dozen.,
9BkHju1KrQCvOU9Tz5qkJg,,,"The seafood platter was amazing our first visit and then a second visit prompts this 2 star review. I am so sorry I deleted pics and lost the ones for this place but the first time was no complaining needed! Everything was great. The second visit a few days later and it was like eating at the crusty crab. The shrimp were burnt, the fish looked like guppies from the Mississippi River. We won't be back"
9Bq09meTAggWpjIsier7iQ,,"Best chargrilled oysters I've ever had. I wanted to take the empty shells and just keep licking the flavor off them. They were warm, the cheese melted and tangy, and amazing. The red beans and rice were good as well. I had the raw oysters as well which were huge! But seriously, get the chargrilled oysters. 

I had such a great experience here as well, everyone was super friendly, and the food kept coming!",
9BzV0NBS2IlohMlxrJgoSA,,,Awesome food and service. The prices weren't bad. I think it was easily some of the best local food I've eaten in New Orleans. Highly recommended.
9BzlclzAH_XdTOijPQZaOw,,,"Was highly disappointed. The pictures on the menu of the corned beef hash looked nothing like what I got. It was canned corned beef they added a few carrots to with some Cajun seasoning. The picture shows a couple big chunks of potato not 85% small diced potatoes. 

I am guessing the biscuits were probably frozen as well. 

I would try again but go with maybe an omelette or pancakes etc. not the canned corned beef. 

Two stars based on the service and smell both were outstanding."

9CetphdXayShYv2fQM2GNA,"This is a review of the Charlotte PK location of Hattie B's.  GREAT CHICKEN and sides but a RIDICULOUSLY LONG WAIT for the food.  I would love to come back because the chicken was so tasty, juicy, and tender, but we waited OVER AN HOUR for our food today at lunch time.  We verified this with the time stamp on our order receipt.  Didn't order something difficult to prepare.  We ordered 2 small orders of DARK (a thigh and a leg) plus our sides of potato salad, and cole slaw.  I know enough about cooking to know that it doesn't take more than 12-15 minutes to fry chicken in a deep fryer.  There is just something wrong with their operations.....at least at the Charlotte PK location.  Other folks besides us were complaining about their wait times, too.   I guess if we go back, we will show up when they open at 11 AM and see if there is an improvement on timing. One of the servers brought us some free banana pudding because they recognized that we had waited too long.....so we appreciated the gesture.  Unfortunately, once you have a bad experience, it's difficult to want to come back.  Food WAS delicious but not worth the inconvenience on time.  I would be upset if we waited this long even at a 4 or 5 star restaurant. SO....be forewarned.   It's not like you're at a charming little street cafe sitting in a quiet spot enjoying the passersby while you wait.  It was hot and it was noisy, so not conducive to conversation and waiting for food.  Hate to write a bad review, cause the staff seemed like nice folks.",,
9Cn_5YadFF_GPF517D2a0g,,"Food here was great! Ordered a 1/2 shrimp 1/2 oyster po boy, and it wildly exceeded my expectations. They really pack in the seafood - there was an abundance of seafood in every bite, and yet there was always seemingly some more falling out onto my plate. Also tried the jambalaya - pretty good, in my opinion.

Atmosphere-wise, it was about as dark as a dive bar. Also, they were blasting the A/C, which is nice at first if you want to get away from the outside heat, but not when you're there for about an hour eating. Still, it's all about the food. 

Definitely get here early. Had a very early dinner (~4:30pm) and when we left, there was a line stretching about half a block.",

The appetizer, 1/2 blackened and fried gator tails, came out super fast, like under 2 mins which was scary considering it was quite packed, we had to go up to the second floor. They were very accommodating to my guy's restriction of pork, the mustard greens were tasty!! To me the crab cake was overrated, as well as the fettuccine but the service was decent. Will return for the red snapper & mustard greens definitely!"

Outside it seems like a small, authentic restaurant with typical NOLA/Southern food, but inside it is enormous. 500 seats! They do serve all the typical southern dishes, but we didn't like anything we tasted. The blackened alligator appetizer was good, but everything else was dry and flavorless. I loaded my food with the hot sauce (which was surprisingly good!) to add some flavor. 
We did love our server, Alex, though! He was very friendly and the best part of our dinner."
9DfIfmYB7zZRd2A3ybvJkw,"Wait about 45 minutes, which was well worth while. The chicken came out steaming hot, with the perfect level of spiciness. The southern greens and black-eyed pea salad were excellent, very authentic Southern cuisine. I would definitely go back next time I come into Nashville.",Phenomenal!

The first few times I came to visit, I avoided it because of the line (and inadvertently found a new favorite next door, bourbon House) We finally got in by swinging by for an early lunch. Two words: chargrilled oysters. UNBELIEVABLE.

I can't even begin to describe the experience of eating one, salty, buttery, with a sprinkling of cheese and a piece of bread to mop it all up. We ordered a dozen. Then another. 
Then another.

Po-boys are also good. And no ifs, ands, or butts. It must all be washed down with an Abita.",
9Fip8swdl_Lq46tC4QVY0A,"Honestly, if you're reading this you already know Hattie B's cooks up some damn good chicken. So, get over to Hattie Bs already and get some.

As for me, I like my spice level to be Damn Hot (1 below the highest). This is mainly due to the fact that as soon as I take my first bite I can satisfactorily yell ""Now that's some Damn Hot chicken"". The chicken yields that classic crunch as you bite into it, and combined with the eye stinging spice I'm in heaven. 

The tenders are my favorite option and then the whole wings are a close 2nd. Hattie's is open late, and it seems that nobody wants to be seen in the light of day consuming roughly 17,000 calories at Hattie Bs, since at about 10:00 at night it's packed. So stop by and realize why Hot chicken exists.",,
9Fltiu7MMOcyG7tfX9i-Bg,,,"After a day of walking around the French Quarter, we brought our appetites and were satisfied. With so many of us we got a good taste of the menu. For appetizers we liked the eggplant sticks and gator bites (blackened is the way to go), the Oceana oyesters aren't bad wither. The seafood platter is huge and enough for two people to share especially if they love fried seafood. Their bread pudding is the perfect way to end the meal. We were not fans of the crab cakes (lacked seasoning for me) or the seafood gumbo. I loved that they were able to accommodate our large party and the service was friendly and helpful with our questions and recommendations."
9FojzOP5HXVtHCvyVAvgHQ,,"This was the one place I was absolutely sure I was going to try while visiting New Orleans and I am so glad I did. Around 6 PM dinner time, there was no wait and my group was seated immediately. 
We ordered the chargrilled oysters since we heard so much about them. The chargrilled oysters were amazing! I wish it was an endless buffet because I just couldn't stop eating them. I love how you get a side of bread with the oysters because after eating the oyster you have to use the bread to get all that butter sauce! Beyond delicious and a great first meal in New Orleans. The first order of chargrilled oysters was eaten so fast that we had to order a second order right away. A dozen chargrilled oysters for $20.99 was a bit steep in price, however, it was well worth it. 
The New Orleans medley was also delicious! I love how you get to try a variety of things all in one dish. Especially when we have a hard time deciding what to get, this dish allows you to try red beans and rice, sausage, seafood gumbo, and jambalaya all in one order.  Everything tasted amazing, but I think I liked the seafood gumbo the most. The jambalaya and red beans and rice were a bit bland. 

When coming here I definitely recommend getting the chargrilled oysters because they were DELICIOUS. It is a must try every time you come to New Orleans. Overall, amazing food and service.",

I never had an authentic one but here I was not disappointed on the flavor. Each bite had a special crunch to it. Mike was our server and he was very helpful. Ooooh but that Alligator  I believe it was the alligator bites were off the chain soooooo good!!!"

The chicken comes in 5 different spice levels.  I got hot and my fiancé got damn hot.  Neither of us dared to get the hottest ""shut the cluck up"" level.  My fiancé LOVES spicy food, literally doesn't think anything is ever hot enough...well he met his match. He could barley eat his without his 4 glasses of sweet tea. This place is not for the faint of heart.

The chicken is juicy, moist and flavorful.  The sides are good, nothing fancy.  All in all worth the wait.",,
9G84FKUkMbEEqQNialslEA,I got the tenders plate with fries and pimento mac and cheese. The tenders were ok. They tasted like chicken. I really did like the Mac and cheese though. Not worth the 30 minute line. Cupcakes from Gigi's next door was pretty good though :),,
9G8EyOAEv5mfSOdsbrIF7A,,"Here's a little trick regarding the long line: when you first arrive, head straight to the door and put your name down with the hostess before getting in line. The line does not determine how quickly you get seated, your name on the list is what does. 

The oysters here are amaaaaaazing. They're the biggest, freshest, plumpest oysters I've ever had. The chargrilled ones are tasty, of course, but why would you let garlic, butter and parsley mask the flavor and shrink the plumpness of these amazing oysters? I would be entirely happy if they had put that same garlic spread on bread and called it a day.

I love that the menu has half-po boy options for those who want a sample of everything but not commit to an entire sandwich. We also shared a half crawfish po boy and a bowl of seafood gumbo and it was really yummy too. The bread served with our food was very soft and light on the inside with a crisp crust on the outside, while the lightly dressed lettuce in the crawfish po boy added a satisfying moistness to the deep fried, battered crawfish pieces. The seafood gumbo was rich with umami flavor - dozens of shrimp and lobster heads must have gone into the making of that gumbo.",

I tried three spice levels:
Hot
Damn Hot
Shut the Cluck Up

I enjoyed Hot and would order this tasty morsel again.

The Damn Hot was hot, but too hot too be flavorful and not hot enough to be ""an experience."" Bry says skip the Damn Hot.

The Shut the Cluck Up was an interesting experience. The heat comes on quick and penetrated the soft tissue of the roof of your mouth and your tongue when you first bite into the chicken. It doesn't linger too much. It does build a little as you have subsequent bites and I could no way way a whole piece of chicken. With trying IF you are a spice head.",,

The gumbo was flavorless and the crawfish etouffee wasn't anything special. 

However, those big fat gulf oysters were tasty. I tried one, even though I told myself I wouldn't ingest any gulf/oil spill oysters, but when they arrived at our table looking delectably good, I couldn't resist.

It wasn't too busy inside the restaurant at the time but the host at the front was not very friendly so I was a bit iffy at first. When I got to my seat though, my server-I don't remember his name at all I just remember that he enjoys acting on the side (haha pretty cool)! Anyways, so my server was excellent. He was very attentive, accommodating and very personable! Also, my table was next to the kitchen so occasionally the cook would stick his head out and tell us jokes or just do some entertaining bits with fire and whatnot. Pretty fun atmosphere! And for the food, I shared the Taste of New Orleans sampler with my boyfriend. To be honest, I ate like 97% of the plate and he took like 3 bites. I loved it and have been craving it ever since! Also, their bananas foster and the bread pudding were delicious. I would say bread pudding was the better of the two but both were amazing. I hope to come back here again one day! :)"
9IqLo4q-SseUKgOkAChEsQ,,"Im pretty sure this is a tourist trap. Well, it is,because that's what the staff told me. The food is kinda expensive, but I do appreciate that they offer a new Orleans sampler, with rice and beans, sausage, your choice of chicken and sausage or seafood gumbo (the chicken and sausage is more flavorful) and jambalaya. 

The gumbo was served with a bit of rice in the inside and boy was it a flavor bomb. It is absolutely filled with sausage and chicken in every bite, the broth is salty and salty and spicy,almost like a beef stew on steroids.  It's hard for me to judge because new orleans cuisine is definitely one I am not familiar with. I can say that it is delicious though,and that I'm happy that they offered a sampler platter. The chicken was tender, and not overcooked like it often is in chicken soup, and the sausage was full of meety flavor, adding its distinct saltiness to the jumbo. 

Whoa, the Jambaya is salty. Like super salty. It has chopped chicken (which had toughened up into something resembling chunks of pork) and sausage (chopped into small pieces)  in it. And both are flavored strongly enough to stand out from the rice of the jumbo (which is what is super salty).

The beans and rice  are pretty good. Not the best baked beans Ive ever had. Theyre almost like slow cooked red beans in Mexican cooking. Except these are a bit softer, and are simmer with chopped up pork. A nice diversion from the salt heavy dishes. 
The sausage is actually my favorite. Its not super salty, sliced long side and grilled, giving it a nice char. It was meaty, not super salty, almost peppery. Definitely different from any sausage I've had before. Drier, but made up for it with the char, which I liked. 

The chargrilled oysters smelled delicious, but for $11.50 for half a dozen, Im going to go and see if I can find a place cheaper before I come back and splurge. Also, the only ingredients on the chargrilled oysters are according to the man at the bar: garlic butter and romano cheese

This is how you shuck an oyster. Stuck the knife into the hole where the tendon holding the shell is. Pressure that hole until it pops, then cut both the muscles (one on each side) holding the oyster in place. And its so much harder than it looks. 

 In the end, the food here is average. But your not really coming here for the food are you? your coming here to for the atmosphere, to watch the people at the bar shuck oysters. Thats the main attraction here",

Even when busy, the wait for food isn't longer than 15 minutes.

We ordered oysters, chargrilled oysters, craw puppies, etouffee, gumbo, and oyster shooters. I thought everything was tasty but those chargrilled oysters CHANGED MY LIFE. I love oysters to begin with but the way they made these were SO GOOD! The oysters are grilled with some kind of sauce which is so delicious and to make it even better they also provide bread for you to mop up all the sauce that oozed out. I seriously need to return to Nola just to eat this again or possibly learn how to make these myself.

9KomoBovwq-3leNi1MFt2g,,"I ate here on the last day of my trip to N.O and was on a bit of a time crunch.  I asked the cabbie on our way to downtown N.O where a good seafood place was and he recommended Acme.  When we approached the door we saw a small line outside of the restaurant, which made my friend and I a little nervous because we had a plane to eventually catch, plus some last minute shopping.  However, we were heavily craving seafood and decided to check and see how long the wait was.  Once we approached a host immediately came up to us and told us that if we were 21+ (which we definitely are) we could sit immediately at the bar.  

After a huge sigh of relief we picked a spot at the bar and was immediately greeted by the bartender that quickly got us our drinks and took our orders.  I got the Peacemaker Po Boy (fried oyster and shrimp) which was so so delicious.  I will definately come back for the Peacemaker my next trip to New Orleans",

I felt obligated to go, so I went with my group and waited for two hours (no problem it was a 12 person group on Saturday night not why only two stars). The food was exceptionally average even after being starving from waiting too long (usually anything would be amazing at that point). Fried shrimp po boy was meh, the chargrilled oysters were good, and the jambalaya was all too buttery and tasted like your average store bought. Our server Tom was GREAT! Only reason it's not one star. He was so nice and attentive. Woman hostess was rude and made one of use move spots to fit a high chair... wasn't necessary to move him. She also jokingly said that they had a table ready after two hours but after waiting that long we weren't in the mood for a joke about that..... the guy hostess apologized for her and was trying really hard to seat us (he seemed sweet). Overall, definitely not worth it unless you have Tom. Not sure why this place is famous still.",
9LFPpMAL_x11t_6cZVL7sQ,"I'm always up for a road trip, and it has been a couple of months since I've been out of town.  This week I'm in Nashville, TN, and I have heard that Hattie B's is where you go for hot chicken.

I've had hot wings, but hot chicken brings this fowl medium an entirely different direction.  It's not sauced like hot wings, and it's not just spicy fried chicken.  After it is marinated, seasoned, breaded, and fried, it is slathered in a cayenne-based paste.  For a more detailed exposition of Nashville's hot chicken, you can consult Serious Eats.

I didn't feel like torching my palate so I settled on the hot chicken.  There were two hotter grades, but I was quite satisfied with my choice.   

The chicken was alive with flavor.  At first you are hit with a wall of cayenne. Then subtle notes of sweetness and hints of paprika bubble to the surface. It was incredible juicy and shrouded in perfectly crackly-crunchy skin.  The flavors were nicely balanced.  

It wasn't like eating a blowtorch, but nearly two hours later, my lips still retain a touch of heat and my esophagus is simmering with warmth.  I knew the line out the door was a good sign and I'm glad I braved the wait in the summer heat.  If you want hot chicken, you need to try Hattie B's.",,

We got there right at 4pm on the Sunday of Memorial Weekend and were the last ones allowed in. 
* Keep this in mind folks; we didn't realize they close at 4 but sure lucked out with our timing.
* The restaurant doesn't close at 4, that's just the close time for people to get in.

Food --- UNREAL. 100/100 stars.
* I got the Small Dark in Mild with Grits (only available on Sundays) and Coleslaw. The coleslaw was the best coleslaw I've ever had! And I'm picky on that. The chicken was next level. I've had other ""famous"" fried chicken in various cities, and while that was good, it was just another fried chicken to me. Not Hattie B's. This is its own food group. This stuff RULES.
* My boyfriend got the Large White in Mild with Pimento Mac n Cheese and Baked Beans. He was also obsessed.

Bottom Line --- Just do yourself a favor and come here. Don't let a line intimidate you. This place and the food is just AMAZING.",,

They aren't kidding about the spice levels (thankfully it's all in the skin) - I did the 'damn hot', which was damn hot.

I recommend getting a seat at the bar. The guys shucking oysters are really friendly and we had a great time chatting with them. They recommended the 'andagator' beer when we ordered a pitcher, so we got that. They didn't tell us until afterwards that it could only be legally sold as a barley wine because of the high alcohol content! To be honest, I didn't notice because the raw and grilled oysters were way too good. Didn't get a chance to try the rest of the food, but I know this is a great place to get oysters, they taste great and you really just can't stop eating them.","Terrible Service
Really really bad. We got ushered in by some guy catcalling from the doorstop. The bloody mary was great, the bbq shrimp appetizer was good. The rest of the food was only okay.

I don't know what the hype is about. The food was pretty mediocre. It was fresh but nothing really screamed ""WOW"" to me. There wasn't anything that I couldn't have eaten anywhere else in New Orleans. The best thing we ate here were the chargrilled oysters and I don't even like oysters that much. 

Would definitely not wait more than 20 mins for this place. One plus was the employees are super nice and attentive. Guess that's the good ol' southern hospitality for you!",

Everything is very sticky. Super overpriced. I have no idea why you'd wait in line. We didn't have to. We both had poboys that were good I actually really liked the dressing on mine. I had fried crawfish and my hubs had a peacemaker. The poboys a beer and a pop was 39$$ I couldn't believe it! My husband actually thought I said 29when I told him the total!

They now have the heat and flavor right!  Wowzers.  This is now a mainstay on the hot chicken circuit.

--------------------------------------------
UPDATED
I went back today to get the tenders, ordered ""hot"" again.  Chicken was juicy, flavor was great, heat level was medium at best.  The experience was better than my first visit so worthy of an additional star.  I will also go back to try the ""damn hot"" to see if this place can truly deliver some heat worthy of the hot chicken scene in this town.
--------------------------------------------
I am a very well-traveled hot chicken fan and this is not hot chicken.  It's decent fried chicken with a sweet, almost honey flavor, but we should not see them at the Hot Chicken Festival.

I ordered wings, take out, ""hot"", with a side of fries and baked beans.  The wings were huge and juicy, flavor was mild and sweet, heat level was almost zero, the bread was not soaked at all.  Fries portion was small and they were not seasoned at all - very generic crinkle cut - but whatever.  Baked beans were actually the best part of the meal.  Chicken wasn't compelling enough to finish my meal.  The fresh squeezed lemonade was great.

I may go back at some point and try the tenders ""extra hot"" with some different sides.",,
9QMPOB3vXULM7EtLHvsUiw,,,We went here because my boyfriend wanted to try alligator (not fried because he wanted you actually taste it) and turtle soup ...so why not kill two birds with one stone and go here? He ordered turtle soup and a blackened alligator po'boy ... I had a Greek salad. He LOVED the alligator and was very happy he found it somewhere that wasn't fried. My salad was a salad but it was pretty big! The waitress was really nice and the service was good.

I had the chicken breast plate meal, medium heat, with coleslaw, mac and cheese and I added the potato salad.  So glad I added the potato salad -- it was the best of ALL the sides.  I also ordered a peach cobbler and it was good as well.  

The chicken was moist and overall pretty good.  Not too greasy which can be a problem sometimes.  I would like to go back on a Sunday and try the chicken and waffles.",,
9RKd-YlzpnHQ-WvwEbmcSw,"Amazing hot chicken and incredible staff and service. 

So far I have been to this place twice and both times there has been a line. Honestly every time I pass by this place there is always a line, so expect to have a little bit of a wait. Also I highly recommend trying to snag a seat inside, because when you eat hot chicken the last place you want to be is outside in the heat. 

There are different levels of Spicy so far I have tried Hot, damn Hot, and shut the click up. I personally am not the best with spices so I enjoy level Hot the best. It's got a little heat that is quite enjoyable. With this said I DO NOT recommend getting anything lower than hot. Do not waste your money getting mild or medium, if I can handle hot I'm sure mostly everyone else can too. Damn Hot wasn't too bad the spice level is a little above my comfort zone, but nothing unbearable. Now shut the cluck up was of course hella spicy--wayyy spicier than I like. I do not recommend getting shut the cluck up unless you are eating this chicken purely for the spice adrenalin rush. Obviously this has a lot of spice but there is so much spice caked on that the texture of the chicken becomes gritty and the overall taste is just not good. Not only that but your stomach will definitely get messed up, if not during then after. Besides the shut the cluck up flavor each chicken is cooked to perfection--crispy on the outside but still succulent and soft on the inside. 

The staff is also incredible. Everyone working there is so friendly. They check up on you-- one of them even gave my friend a free milk for eating 2 shut the cluck ups. Not only that but they help you when ordering and also work in an efficient caring matter despite the never ending line of customers. The food is also made fast and fresh. 

My last word of advice is ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER! Do not touch your face or eyes. The friend I mentioned before made the mistake of eating the shut the cluck up and not washing his hands before he went to the bathroom...let's just say he felt spice in a place he did not want too...",,

The soft shell blue crab was soooo delicious too, I think we licked the entire plate clean!! This place was totallllly worth the wait!! The waiter and staff are also super friendly! I would consider this place my best and favorite meal in NOLA.",
9S85BzJTqotw9JqVwc_YyA,,"I guess I'm new to Cajun food, but just about everything is deep fried.  Not a good spot to dine if you're watching the calorie count.  

Food was pretty good.  Got the grilled oysters to start off with.  They were yummy, but just drenched in butter and completely covered in cheese.

I chose the medley as my entree.  The red beans and rice was probably the best thing on the plate, but the gumbo and jumbalaya were pretty good too.  Sausage was nothing to write home about.

The rest of my group got po-boys, and I have to say the shrimp po-boy was beastly in size.

The atmosphere is lively.  But gosh darn, you have a hard time hearing anyone at your table with all the noise.  We had to wait outside for about 15 minutes to get a table, so it's definitely a packed house.


Altogether, it was fun and the food was pretty good.  Important to keep in mind that with people waiting outside, you'll be ""pushed"" in and out fast.  Don't expect to sit around for dinner for an hour.  You'll probably be in and out in 25 minutes.",
9SMgQeO7TYetcFm_vm4RlA,,,Great ambiance. Would definitely recommend the Redfish Oceana and the Gator Tail bites. Yummy!

Someone else in our party had the burger and she said it was just ok, nothing special at all.  Crawfish etouffee was amazing also.

Normally the highlight of the sandwich isn't usually the bun, but this bun was incredible. Super soft, yet it held up to all of the ingredients. And trust me, this was a HUGE sandwich. The piece of fried chicken was massive and the coleslaw was cool and complimented the hot chicken beautifully. A little of Crystal hot sauce and this sandwich was freakin money! We also ordered the half bird and the chicken was super moist and crispy on the outside. Sides weren't that good, but let's be real, your coming here for the chicken. I would say that the chicken sandwich was worth the 45 minute wait in line.",,"This restaurant is the exact description of a tourist trap. I would avoid this place if you are visiting NOLA. We ordered the oysters, alligator bites, and the seafood platter. I'm not a big oyster fan but my wife and brother are and after they had one oyster they literally could not eat another one. The alligator bites were a little creepy. It was really chewy and not pleasant. The seafood platter consisted of fried oysters, catfish, and shrimp. The shrimp was the only good thing on the platter. The oysters and catfish were just funky. Lastly, the bread pudding was actually pretty good but it was a little too sweet. I wouldn't recommend coming here. High prices, and not very good food."

I got the half bird with half hot and half damn hot sauce.  The hot was perfect heat for me and truly amazing. It was a dry heat with good balance and complemented the perfectly juicy chicken.  The damn hot was a wet sauce that was VERY hot. The flavor was even better than the lesser hot version.  I've never had anything like it and the pain was sooo worth it.  I got 3 sides...pimento Mac n cheese, greens, and coleslaw.  None of them blew my mind but the slaw was tasty and nice change of pace from the heat of the chicken.  The greens were also solid when you put a good amount of the pepper vinegar supplied at each table.  Mac n cheese had nice creaminess and flavor.

We asked about their specialty drinks.  My wife really enjoyed her blue bloody Mary and I was really getting into the Acme Sunsets.  The chargrilled oysters were simply awesome.

Maria was our waitress, and she took very good care of us.  We followed her dinner recommendations and were rewarded with some great New Orleans specialties.  My wife had the NO Medley, with samples of sausage, gumbo, and jambalaya.  I tried a little of everything and enjoyed it as much as she did.  But my meal was even better than hers.  I had the ettoufee  with crawfish, and it was so rich and flavorful, and was just marvelous.

We finished up by sharing some bread pudding.  The whiskey sauce really made a difference.",
9UL2NzU6Y14JqDjTBIDKTw,Ordered the dark meat platter and wings... Cooked to perfection! Mild was blazing hot for me (a wimp) and Damn Hot was blazing hot for my boyfriend who seriously loves the heat. Potato salad and mac were pretty standard. Friendly service and solid beer selection.,,
9URHE0PL2EDZDOXbGqH3ow,"The 90-minute wait...outside in 40° was worth it for me. From what I was told, this is the Original Hattie B's Chicken so a lot of hype and history at this place. I had the Tender Plate (two Hot tenders, one Damn Hot tender w/ fries and coleslaw). I was a little worried about the spice levels but Hot was a little underwhelming and Damn Hot felt like it was right on the money of being spicy (caused a little sweat) without the misery. The chicken itself was so juicy! Fries and coleslaw were on point and was the perfect accompaniment to the tenders. Also ordered the peach cobbler to end the meal but it was pretty much a ""gloopy"" consistency and had a burnt taste. 

This location will always have a line of people so please make sure you show up at least an 1.5 - 2hrs before closing.",,

I love this place too much.  When I first moved to Nashville a few months ago, I went to Hattie B's a few times a week.  That was excessive and my ass showed it, but my mouth was so happy.  There are varying degrees to choose from.  I do the hot, which is pretty hot and you may not be able to which is OK.  There are two hotter degrees above that one, which I'll try one night when I'm trying to impress someone.  Oh, that chicken.  Mmmmmmm.....

We had crawfish boil, peace maker po boy (shrimp and oysters), fried softshell crab (my son's favourite on our Nola trip) and charbroiled oysters. The oysters were good but not as great as Drago's. They're not as cheesy but equally buttery. Highly recommend coming here. Atmosphere was unique and service was friendly.",

9Wb3MwNwg-k7T2XNOTLDiw,"Heard about this place on the food network AND the travel channel.. Couldn't not visit this place while I was in Nashville. The line was 35-45 deep on a Saturday night, the wait was about 45 minutes, when I got inside I placed my order and found a spot on the patio, I ordered a large dark...too much food for me BUT there was no way I could be convinced otherwise the chicken was THE BEST chicken I've ever had, so good I thought to myself ""is this what chicken is supposed to taste like!?""  It was heavenly....I'm not even hugely into spicy foods but the hype around this place had me going so much that I gave the medium a try, it was perfect, any hotter and I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it, the sides good, better than fast food joints & about the same as your normal southern restaurant, seating is hard to find unless you're crafty...id suggest if you're going with a friend have them claim a table while you order for the both of you, otherwise you'll end up sharing a table or sitting in a weird spot at the bar on the patio. I ended up coming back two days later to grab some more ""hot chicken"" for the road...it was a bit spicier than my previous visit but great nonetheless, definitely give this place a try while you're in Nashville, it's well worth the wait!",,

9Wqwbhir5nzDKuLtlDQsrg,"Hopped off the plane on a Saturday around 11am and drove straight here (because Prince's was closed) and couldn't have had a better experience to kick off the weekend. I'm a fan of spicy foods but went medium because I didn't want to ruin my time here in Nashville with an irresponsible spice decision. 

The combination of a killer hip hop soundtrack while crushing hot chicken, collard greens, mac & cheese and a crisp fountain soda really made this experience unforgettable. If I was to do it again, I'd up the spice factor and bring like 30 more people to own the outdoor porch scene. 

They also chanted ""40! -- 40! -- 40!"" for a dude who ordered a 40oz of miller high life. 

5/5, 10/10. Hell yes Hattie B's. 





p.s. line was crazy but doable. suck it up and deal with it. or get there at at off hour. idk. up to you.",,
9WvMB1HUVkj4DZrey0jE7A,I really loved the food but I had to try getting inside twice because the line was too long. So that is a downside but it is not a disappoint when you finally get to the chicken! Just make sure you have plenty of time to wait. There is no parking at the area so you'll have to pay for a lot. The staff was also very friendly which I can appreciate when the place is so busy.,,

It's simple.  Pick your chicken.  Pick your level of hot.   I'm not a hot sauce fan but went with the medium and got the chicken tenders and this was just the right level of everything for me.   With a side of pimento mac and cheese-which had it's own zip and was perfectly cheesey and gooey in its own way.   One of the best mac and cheeses I've ever had!     Back to the chicken.   Cooked perfect, fat chicken tenders with some zip and the honey mustard sauce cut the heat a little.

If only they did chicken and waffles everyday I'd be happy.   On the list for the next trip!   This is a must!",,
9XR4pMKRS5jotVKyhRnzaw,"Visited from out of town and the first person we asked about Nashville Hot Chicken recommended Hattie's! 

Now for those of y'all who THINK y'all know something about spice and claim to love spicy food ... come get tested by Nashville Hot. When we asked about the different spice levels - the server compared their HOT to like eating jalapeños; I love jalapeños and thought that was nothing so I tried the DAMN HOT spice level...NEVER AGAIN. 

We each had the Chicken sandwiches at DAMN HOT spice level. I was shedding tears after my first bite. Definitely more spice than flavor which is why this place loses a star. I also tried the pimento mac & Cheese along with the Dirty Bird fries (at the Shut the Cluck Up spice level- didn't even eat the chicken). I absolutely dislike pimento but love Mac & Cheese so tried it here and definitely enjoyed it. 

We did love the food and I will definitely come back whenever I'm in town.",,

We got one hot and one light mild and they both tasted hot... not a fan of a lot of spice so did not like that.

Charbroiled Oysters and the Crab Cake with Corn Maque Choux. Last but not least, the New Orleans Sampler (gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice and grilled smoked sausage) with a side of the best hushpuppies we've ever had. Everything was delicious.

I had my very first Po'Boy here, and let me just say it fulfilled my every expectation!  Beautiful courtyard, incredibly friendly staff.  We had 30 minutes to eat and run, and the manager made sure our wait staff knew that.  Our food came right away, they got us in and out, but very friendly the whole time.

Besides all that, the Catfish Po'Boy was absolutely mouthwatering.  I thought the breading might be crunchy, like fish n' chips, but it was tender and moist.  The bread was nice and soft, and the sauce they used was perfect.  Just a perfect first experience, and I highly recommend it!

If (hopefully when) I make it back to NOLA, this will be one of my first stops."

Chicken was over fried, I had a couple of pieces that were fried perfect, and a couple of pieces that were burnt.  Flavor, just ok, kind of a funky taste.  Maybe I should get a more than medium?

I'm always on the lookout for fried chicken, this does not rank in my top 5.

Oh and long wait for the chicken.",,

9ZXaiRPUbjBscTY5F2Kf_A,,"Went on a Sunday. Walked by around lunch time to check the place out and the line was so so long so I came back around 5pm for an early dinner. There was still a line so I went inside to grab a glass of wine. Ordering wine from the bar was kind of difficult- not because the bartender was busy with customers- but because she was busy chit chatting with her co-worker and didn't notice I was there. So I stood for there for about 5 minutes until someone told her I needed something. I ordered my wine and walked outside and within two minutes we were seated. 

Our server James was amazing. He was kind and made me recommendations when I couldn't decide what to order. Here's what we got. 
Raw oysters - nice and big but too sandy!
Chargrilled oysters - so delicious but also super sandy
Side of jambalaya - nothing spectacular
Fried crawfish tails - came highly recommended but all I tasted was the fried batter. Dipping sauce was great
Crab cakes - not enough real crab meat and too much filler 
Smoked sausage - out of everything I ordered, this was the best tasting item

Overall I feel this restaurant it way too overrated. The oysters could've been great had they clean the oysters well. The whole time I was eating, I was worried about cracking my teeth. This was very disappointing. Now I'm on a hunt to find a better seafood restaurant.",

For meals we got: jambalaya, gumbo, sampler plate, hot sausage poboy,  acme special poboy and a hamburger without the bun, add mushrooms, onions and gravy to make a hamburger steak. We then got bread pudding for dessert. Everything was delicious, and there was no speck of food left on anyone's plate :) The bread pudding is good, but comes in tiny cups. The service was decent as well. I would certainly recommend this location!",
9_oZjFPgbr9ARXpUtEfypA,,,Amazing food and service. This is the first place in New Orleans that I ate and it was a great experience. I ordered their world famous crab cakes and they were just as great as everyone says. Our server Derek was incredible! Highly recommend!!
9_xz4nr6ZRawENDPNHDGxw,,"Great oyster place in the French Quarter.  Can't speak to anything other than the oysters but both the fresh and the charbroiled ones are so good can't even think to try anything else.  Oysters are just fresh and has a beautiful brine-y flavor.  These are shucked well, no bits of shell inside, which I've found in other places.",

The wait was 45 minutes, the lighting was creepy and red and everything was super tight (you can't even stretch) but the food was great I came with 3 other guests. I asked the check to be split and the waitress says they're not allowed. I asked to speak with the manager who actually tried to degrade and embarrass me for this request after I'd initially asked pleasantly. Apparently, if you ""come as a party, you pay as a party"". So if you and your friends come in to dine, make sure one of you are ready to pay for everyone or be shamed for making a simple request.","To be the self-proclaimed ""best restaurant in NOLA"" ... no. 

As an hour wait I experienced very BLAND tastes across the board and a TIGHT seating arrangement. Couldn't even stretch. Won't return."

It was one of the better meals I had near Bourbon St, the prices weren't bad... the wait staff left a little to be desired, but it wasn't horrible, and I have to give them a little credit since this is a tourist haven.

I'd recommend checking it out if the line isn't too long.",

We came on a Saturday at 5:00pm and it took us about 45 minutes to get to the front of the line but we waited another 45 for our food. 

The food itself was good and I'm glad we tried it. I got the tenders with fries and potato salad. Make sure to ask for the dipping sauces like ranch and honey mustard. The chicken was tasty and delicious, but to be honest, it didn't taste a ton different than Popeyes to me. I'm not a spicy fan so I got the Southern with no spice. The BF and his friend both got mild and medium though. The medium was plenty hot they said. 

I'm glad we tried it but it was definitely a long and lengthy excursion to get the food.",,
9biXWKPOGmXTPrJJ9ZBKfA,"Honestly, I could not have been more disappointed. Having traveled from California to Nashville to try some hot chicken, this was such a disappointment. I even read all the glowing review but I guess it's hard to gauge people's spice levels...

We came around 7PM and waited a little less than an hour which was okay. I'm used to waiting for good food. I ordered the small dark at medium spice and my boyfriend ordered tenders at mild. 

The chicken looks very good. Red and oily and looks spicy. I was kinda worried about the spicy level having died at Bolton's over medium spice level. I took a bite and not even mild. No wonder why the people in front of me order damn hot.... I would have gave Hattie B's a higher rating if the chicken also tasted good but it was literally just super salty. Popeye's and KFC have better chicken flavor.

The sides were also not remember able. The coleslaw was pretty bland and very wet.

If I make it back to Nashville, I might give Hattie B's another try but with Damn Hot or the chicken sandwich.",,
9c-D_dCmnUF38dpYuWepzg,,,Food was good. Service was good but we felt rushed.  Appetizers came out and then food came out right after.  They took food back and kept it on heat lamp until we were done apps so it wasn't really hot.  Oysters were delicious

9cx1tPGujYkeQ2srAWI0dg,"This place was poppin! A little pricey for chicken meals but the quality was great. The chicken tasted fresh and juicy. The house sauce was perfect on the sandwich too.

I'm so thankful the hubs LOVES fried chicken and convinced me to wait. We got the hit chicken sandwich, the pimento Mac & cheese and two ala carte hot chicken tenders to share. As you can see, the portions are hearty and everything was cooked to perfection!  The hot is good--enough heat to live up to its name, but not so hot that it over powers the AMAZING juicy and crunchy chicken!!  I wasn't quite sure about pimento mac and cheese at first, but I can say without a doubt it was the best Mac & cheese we had in Nashville.

She said we can't have someone come sit with us after we're seated. Um, that was not necessary to mention especially if we just said the number changed to 3.

We were also seated in the back, next to the walk in which was FREEZING due to staff going In and out repeatedly. The server was nice and he was obviously busting his behind.

9h0frJGtPpRCOBp3cl4pWg,"In the 1980s I lived 2 blocks from this location at the corner of 21st and West End (I went to Vanderbilt). Back then there was no Hattie B's and hot chicken was unknown, even in Nashville. Hot chicken originated in the 1940s at Prince's several miles outside downtown. However, places like Hattie B's are the ones that made it trendy. Every time we had been to Nashville the line was always too long. On a cold, rainy night in January 2019 we were able to finally get in with only a 10 minute wait. The issue I have is that I am not really a big fan of Nashville hot chicken. I love spicy food, but find the flavor of cayenne overwhelming. The good news is that you can order your chicken at a range of 6 levels of spicy (starting with no spice aka Southern fried chicken). I ordered mine at level 4 or hot (there is an extra hot and a shut the cluck up). Next time I would probably go for medium. The atmosphere is great and if you are a fan of any type of fried chicken Hattie B's is worth a visit. I am just glad people warned me not to go beyond hot (most people suggested medium but I just had to at least try the hot)",,

Oysters: obviously their oysters are from Louisiana. I don't know if they had the caged, highly salinated oysters that they farm way out in the saltier, colder part of the ocean - the guy looked at me a little crazy when I asked - but the smaller oysters they had at the time were the best tasting, saltiest, most flavorful oysters I've ever had. The large ones were fine too, but the smaller ones were perfect. Their chargrilled oysters are also the best I've had - they're like Oysters Rockefeller but without the spinach. 
Other food:  I had the gumbo and the crawfish etoufee with a side of fried crawfish tails. I'm not from Louisiana, so of course the gumbo tasted wonderful to me. However, the etoufee was perfection. I'm back home in L.A. and I'm still thinking about that etoufee. It was a perfect example of what a good roux tastes like and how important a good roux is, and even though my mom is Filipina, this etoufee reminded me of her cooking. It tasted like home cooking for real. 
Drinks: Abita is the local beer. I had an Abita Amber and the Abita purple haze. Both really good beers, but I fell in love with the purple haze. It's made with raspberries - and I AM NOT a flavored beer fan - but I ended up ordering purple haze throughout my trip whenever it was on the menu. 
Service: we sat at the oyster bar, and while the guys oyster shucking caused me to get quite a bit of shell pieces in my oysters, the folks behind the bar were great, kind, friendly, quick, and generous. The guys shucked an extra oyster for me as a gift because it was the biggest one they had. 
I'm coming back here the next time I'm in NOLA for sure!",
9hr8tl52s61MNXYV-LvqqA,"OMGosh! Best fried chicken ever! Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Their sides are ok so nothing to rave about. Their service is inconsistent. Sometimes you get someone who is patient and smiles. There are times when you get that one who obviously hates his/her job and good service is not a top priority. Oh, but oh their chicken...just divine! Always super busy so order online to pick up. Trust me. Order online.",,
9i6L_mn_4MLQGwmE-L2QYA,,"The only item you really need to get here is the chargrilled oysters.  I devoured these within minutes and I'm not even an oyster lover!  The wait could be long at times, but the food is well worth it",
9iDTHVYy0eKrQw5m2Q2g1Q,,"So, I got another one of my oyster cravings and said to myself, ""Self, quit being such a snob and go try Acme.""  After all, it was a rainy Monday afternoon a bit after 1:00.  I decided that if there was still a line like there usually is, I'd bounce elsewhere.  Luckily, I managed to get there while there was no line.  This is a self-proclaimed New Orleans tradition, but I'm not sure how many of the patrons were local.  I was seated at the bar and decided to just get a half dozen oysters this time because they're EXPENSIVE (I've said it before, and I'll say it again, F**K BP.)  The oysters were good, of course.  I was disappointed that their cocktail sauce comes pre-made as I prefer to customize mine, but so be it.  Still, next time, I'll just bite the proverbial bullet and order a whole dozen.  Ordering half a dozen is like having halfway sex (uh, UUh,  OYEAH, huh, WTF!)

Then my entree sandwich arrived:  The Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy, which consists of fried shrimp and oysters.  When it arrived, I laughed a bit at my own naivete.  I was expecting the shrimp and oysters to be layered atop each other, but the sandwich was a typically NOLA half & half with shrimp on one side and oysters on the other.  I could have mixed them up to blend the flavors, but...naaah.  That could have been messy.  I have to say, the po-boy was STUFFED full.  That's a good thing, but for $12.99, it damn well better be overstuffed.  The service was pretty much what one should expect from a hyper-busy tourist trap:  not bad, not special.  I was glad that I was able to get in and out in 20-25 minutes, most assuredly a rarety here.  Everything was fine, just not spectacular.  However, at $28 (inc. tax & tip) for a half dozen oysters and and 8"" po-boy with no drink save water, this frugal diner (AKA, cheap bastard) will enjoy his memories and probably not return anytime too soon.  I'll be at Felix's standing at the oyster bar and laughing at the line outside across the street at Acme (which, btw, had re-formed by the time I left).",
9iQVl7cl50UzS6ioWAwbKQ,,,Excellent service. Food was delicious. The garlic lemon sauce on the crab cakes was fresh and tangy. The crawfish mushroom cream sauce complimented the spicy redfish. A real treat for the taste buds. My husband also ordered the bourbon pecan pie and it just melted in your mouth. Best meal of our trip.
9izOadii5XrZz3yIiTkC_Q,,"The oysters were just ok, the shrimp po boy was ok, the bread pudding was decent. But the server, sucked ass! Seriously, the worst ever! When she brought our oysters out she dropped the plate mid table, and walked off. Didn't bring small plates, or napkins, was rude as hell, and had the most annoying child's voice ever! Pass Acme up if it's on you're NOLA list, there's too many other places with muuuuuuch better charbroiled oysters (Drago's or Neyows)",
9jCLSyVvAn8q32zwHXZGDg,,I was back for the 4th time in NOLA  2 weeks ago. I am usually in town for the oyster festival in June and I have ate charbroiled oysters at probably every restaurant in the quarter and surrounding areas each time I visit.  I have to say that hands down these are the best I have had so far. Great service as well. I will definitely be back on my next trip to my favorite city besides my own (Miami).,
9jMQg7rAtygF96qBwKMhPQ,"Yummy is how i would describe the food here.  The chicken is cooked perfectly, the Mac and cheese creamy and delicious.  However the banana pudding was just mediocre which is why I gave it 4 stars.

9jeLuDqRTy8IcrIpTG8J6g,,"My wife and I recently ate at Acme Oyster House and had a great time.  We were walking to Bourbon Street and wanted to eat first before enjoying the bar seen.  There was a line out front but after talking to some people the line moved pretty quick.  We waited for about 20 minutes or so, we were seated and had beers in hand.  The place has a great atmosphere, very comfortable.
The waitress came right over to take our order.  We started with the crab cake and raw oysters for an appetizer which both were good.  The oysters for the price were very good, about a dozen for $14 or so.  For being from the Northeast I still can't compare them to a good cold water oyster from New England.  For dinner my wife had the beef Po Boy and I had the Fried Peace Maker Po Boy.  That thing was great, I would highly suggest it.  
The wait staff were very friendly and attentive to us even though the place was packed.  
If you're heading to New Orleans I would definitely suggest finding one of these places in town and checking it out.",
9jmV17BatOzASvxj7oQw1g,Part of the Nashville experience.  Food was awesome and the portion was big for the price.  I got talked out of ordering a hotter spice of chicken by a guy in line and it was a mistake.  I could have had another level up on the spice and I would have been comfortable.  I would come again on my next visit to Nashville.,,
9kIcMeveJXxWGVOVdXyQyg,,"Great little place right off Bourbon Street on Iberville. There was a line when we got there at 5pm, but it moved quickly and in a very orderly manner. Good crowd control by the restaurant.

I was told they have terrific Char-grilled Oysters, so I decided to go with that for my meal. I started off with a dozen and after tasting them ordered another half dozen. The oysters had a great light smokey flavor to go along with butter, garlic and Parmigiana cheese. The texture was perfect. They may have been the freshest oysters I've ever eaten.  

My sister went with Boo Fries which were drenched in a wonderful beef gravy. I sampled those in exchange for a few oysters. We also got an order of hush puppies that were quite authentic. You could tell they were fried in the same oil as the catfish which is exactly how it should be. She finished up with a 10 napkin beef po'boy that was wonderful. More of that delicious gravy on soft bread with beef. Mmm...Messy and tasty. 

All in all this was one of my favorite food experiences while I was back in New Orleans. 

Tip. Try to go early, it seemed like the line grew longer the later it got.

For good seafood and good cooking all around, y'all should try this place.",

We came here for dinner on a late Friday night....close to about 9pm and there was still a line out the door. Don't worry, line went by pretty quick...I'd say we only had to wait for about 10 minutes."

The best thing to order is definitely the chargrilled oysters. The sauce that it is soaked in is delicious and full of butter. They give you plenty of bread to dip in the sauce. We had to get a 2nd order because it was the best item of the night.

Other dishes are all quite good. I also liked the etoufee and the jambalaya. They have a sampler platter so you can try all the New Orleans favorite in small portions. I highly recommend it.

The service is pretty good even though it's busy. Food comes out quickly as well. If I'm ever in New Orleans again I would definitely come to Acme for more oysters.",

I had the shrimp platter with fries & a side of potato salad. The potato salad was good but the shrimp were the best I've ever had. Large shrimp that are fried perfectly!  Portions are plentiful.

I like things spicy, get hot wings medium to hot, again, on me. But what was not on me was the dryness of the chicken.

Second day we tried the crawfish etouffee and the Taste of New Orleans (this came with jambalaya, red beans and crawfish etouffe). Yet again, everything was delish!

9s9CsOa63sk72UBhS5bs3Q,,,Hands down when you come to New Orleans you must stop here. Reservations arent required but recommended but its not a must have. They are able to get people in relatively quickly if there is not a big convention in town

I got the platter with gumbo, red beans, and etc. It was just Ok. This place specializes in Oysters but the other food didn't make me crave more.",Ok so - Drink a Hurricane. Also the food was very very delicious. I think they got the whole Creole food vibe and taste. The service was great and she made excellent recommendations. I highly recommend this place!
9t0q6uTaBh0GmnZQ46hweA,,Always love eating here.  The food is always good. The lines are always so darn long.  No matter what time of day it is there is always a long darn line. But it is worth the wait.  The food was delicious and so fresh.  I cannot wait until next year when I return. .,

Please please get a menu and review it, it makes it easier when ordering . I had the hot 2 piece dark with pimento mac&cheese and greens, it was  wonderfully delicious. The other half had the 1/2 chicken Damn Hot and I will tell you he can handle some hot, he said it had a delicious spice and a lot of ""afterburn""  I think I seen him break a sweat .  The staff was friendly and super patient with those that needed a little more time ordering ( refer to get a menu). This is a repeat stop when in Nashville .",,
9tPew2ZY9crPYNHrL6Zwkw,,,"Great find! Came here at the suggestion of a coworker while we're in town for a convention. Left totally satisfied and needed a good long walk afterwards.

We shared a dozen raw oysters that were plump and fresh. Bowl of gumbo wasn't too thick and was super tasty. I had a jambalaya pasta which is a good sized portion to fill you up without going overboard.

Staff was friendly and our food came out quickly. Super plus that there was no wait to get a table either (around 1PM on Sunday)."

So good-Every time

Nashville hot and spicy fried chicken. Yum Yum Yum. Awesome chicken, awesome service, cool place, fun location and reasonably priced.

Order your meal in 5 or 6 spicy levels. Theres a ton of sides to choose from and the beer is cold. The peach cobbler is so good if you have room left to eat it. Ive been to several hot chicken places, this one is at the top of my food chain. :-) Yum.

9uoPfxPKCdV5Jl3HseVOHQ,,"Came here for lunch yesterday at 11am, and waited for about 30 mins. Had half a dozen chargrilled and half a dozen fresh oysters, both were delicious, but my fave was the chargrilled! We also had the fried shrimp platter topped with a soft shell crab, both were yummy but they have less shrimp than I saw in other yelp photos, maybe cause we had ordered the soft shell crab but there's an extra charge for that so I don't feel that it should reduce the amount of shrimp we got. The fries were kinda soggy, but the coleslaw was ok. The gumbo with the rice on the side was really yummy, much better than the gumbo I got the night before at the cafe at the HYATT French Quarter, where I'm staying during this visit. I also got a side of sausage, which was a perfect smoky flavor. I saw a line at this place all day since my hotel is next door so I recommend coming for lunch around the time they open for reduced waiting times.",

9usI1_rD-gYUNNe2SrQAwQ,,,Saw the reviews on Yelp and decided to try breakfast; it was amazing!  I had the French Toast with strawberries and the hubs had Cajun omelette and both were amazing! Can't wait to try lunch or dinner on our next trip!

My son got mild and said he could ""feel it the next day"". TMI, I know. If you are sensitive to heat, beware. The chicken was great but the sides were meh at best. We got the Pimento Mac and Cheese, cole slaw and greens and banana pudding for dessert. All were cafeteria quality.

However: 
The hot chicken and waffles on Sundays are ridiculously good.  Parking is bad, ambience well it could be better, but the food is silly good.
Spicy chicken is hot, real hot, and delicious.  The waffles are perfect.  
The Pimento Mac and cheese are recommended the cole slaw and greens not as much.

9wWlesygBUkb3aaFXYghWA,,,"There are very specific moments of my last trip to New Orleans which spring to mind, and one of those is my dining experience at Oceana.

Two words: Praline Duck

OMG. But let me back up...

My friend Anh and I initially entered and were seated near the front door, which turned out great for a spell because we were able to see and hear a brass parade going down the road! Seriously, that's one thing I adore about NOLA and which really sets it apart for me.

Once my husband arrived to join us, we asked if there was seating out on the patio. We were guided to a table in a central courtyard where we were surrounded by historic walls and windows going up a few stories. So the environment was already on a roll...

Enter the FOOD. Now, I don't normally gravitate toward duck, but I was in New Orleans and wanted to try something outside of my norm. When my eyes lighted on the words ""Praline Duck,"" I was hooked.

I am here to tell you today that it was one of my top 10 meals ever consumed. I ate every.single.bite. It was a perfect blend of succulent and sweet. I even got that look on my face when my husband (a notorious duck-lover) swiped a bite.

I'm going back to NOLA this spring and will absolutely be stopping in for more Praline Duck!"
9wbd8FVCFDpDUg3ZStSOGg,,,"The best meal in NOLA. Best oyster, best jambalaya and best dessert! Five starts definitely!"
9wfFBzEf-kikxhUTVAgCog,,,"We came here around 10pm for a late dinner. Everyone that we knew said we must stop by here. I ordered the Oceana's Famous Oysters which is Freshly shucked Louisiana Oysters on the half-shell, chargrilled over and open flame, smothered with our unique zesty garlic and cream herb cajun sauce, finished with a fresh blend of parmesan and romano cheeses. OMG trust me when I say you have not had char oysters until you have these! I also ordered their special of the night which was grilled red fish, mash and greens. Everyone was picking off my dish! Lots of flavor, grilled perfect and it wasn't too fishy. I say that because my sister in law doesn't like fish and she liked it."
9wsQh_8nqVXcA7DKx6V8NA,,"Acme by far has the best chargrilled oysters around! We had visited the Destin location before, and were so excited to go to the original!
Our waitress was so kind! We got 2 dozen of the Chargrilled oysters, and they're so phenomenal! I could eat these every meal and not get tired of them. They're so big at this location as well! I was so happy with this experience, and highly recommend it to anyone in the area!",

With oyster in the name, you expect the best.  The chargrilled oysters were good, just not as good as Felix across the street.  They were nice and cheesy, but very greasy.  I had the roast beef po' boy because it had the fan favorite star beside it.  It was good, but didn't blow me away.  The gumbo was apparently not great.

While everything tasted good, I would never wait forever in that line when I know how great Felix is across the street, which never has a line.  If you insist on going, go early or late.  We arrived 10 minutes before they cut off seating and only waited 15 minutes.",

Expect a line to order your food, then you will be pleasantly surprised on the uncommon occasion that the line is short or non-existent.  My favorite combo is the Damn Hot leq quarter and the black-eyed pea salad with extra dressing.  The dressing is the perfect offsetting antidote to that wonderful chicken burn.  If you're lucky enough to be eating at the one in West Nashville, Bobbie's is right next door with a soft serve cone to complete your food coma.",,

Mine as well drink on the streets if the law lets you.  While we waited, we met the most interesting retired couples!  According to yelp, Felix's oyster house is just as good and right across the street, but you have to try this world famous oyster house at least once right?

Started off with one dozen char grilled oysters.  I think it was close to $14 for a dozen gulf coast oysters, so it's actually pretty pricy!  The oysters were so fresh with buttery goodness combined cheese, herbs!  We also had the oyster, shrimp po boy with a bowl of red beans and rice...both amazing as well.",
9yGYVa3vzl7dm9vBCZ09gg,"Pepperfire was closed for ""an hour"" so we decided to trek to this well-known hot chicken spot. Boy am I glad we went out of our way to go here. Amazing. Definitely rivals Pepperfire for flavor of the chicken... but blows it out of the water for dining tables and location. They also serve beer. My favorite was the pimento mac n cheese and, of course, the fantastically moist and unbelievably perfect crispiness of the chicken. They also offered a no spicy option as opposed to Pepperfire's all spiced. I got mild and it was a bit too mild.. but packed with flavor. Love it.",,
9yHqe65dsNE2-OwEm58-2Q,"Hot chicken is king!

Let's face it, hot chicken has always been king in Nashville, but now there's a nice new local chain serving it up!

Don't cringe at the word ""chain""...

Hattie Bs is doing it right. Hot chicken, pickles, white bread, beer and crinkle fries. Drool.

The hotness? 

""Damn Hot"" is just that... 
""Shut the Cluck Up""? Yup. 

If super hot isn't your thing, then the milder sauces are delish... My recommendation, get the tenders ""Hot"" and have one tender in a hotter sauce as a sample. 

There's a line out the door during lunch or dinner. It's not a fast moving line so to avoid it go at an ""off"" time, like mid afternoon. There is also a new location on Charlotte and one announced to open in Germantown. 

Enjoy!",,
9ymM7luuOTk49lgxvQ-FXw,"We ordered the plates and the portion is extra large size piece of chicken if you know what I mean. Price is great and the chicken is fabulous. Personally I did not care much for the sides but the fried chicken was amazing. I got mine in medium and pretty dang hot but  I think next time I will get mild since I'm not too tolerant to hot spicy food.
But I have to say the BEST fried chicken ever. Line was too long so we ordered online and literally just picked it up in half hour. Food was still hot and fresh. 
So worth the wait or the drive whatever you are thinking. I went there based on reviews so I hope you consider trying it after reading this.",,
9yt8E8goZ8eUvUoNGIIkRw,,"oysters and hot sauce, oh my!!

first i have to say, don't be deterred by the three stars.  i definitely recommend this place, and you should wait in line for it (the line moves fast, and it's not like it's going to be snowing out or anything).

the good:

food!  i think we had 2 or 3 dozen oysters between us, some the traditional half-shell variety, and some of their specialty chargrilled types.  although i tend to be a purist about oysters, those chargrilled puppies were spectacular!!  i had to stop my boyfriend from licking out the shells.  but i didn't stop him from ordering more.

we also had a sampler that came with etouffee, jambalaya, and red beans n rice... nola staples.  good and solid, nothing outstanding though.

some interesting cocktails and local brews, but nothing that stood out to me.

decor and ambiance was meh.  the server was very nice, but too busy and we were often waiting on refills or to order something else.  i appreciate the kitchiness of the checkered tablecloths and down-home atmosphere, but you can still make it look polished, and it seemed like they didn't really bother.

i will reiterate that i absolutely recommend anyone to visit this place while in nola, but my biggest gripe is about places like this that are famous and get a ton of business, and thus don't really bother about the details since people are going to come in the door regardless.

anyway, just go and eat some oysters for me!!",
9ziHStUpDI2bN2G07om9uA,,,"First time ever eating here and it was absolutely delicious! We got the loaded fries with the cream sauce, crawfish and shrimp and mushrooms as an appetizer. It was perfect.

9zlIJ7Q5W4AENjpGgaNSsQ,,,"This place is a total scam. The food is gross and not very quality. I was fooled by how many reviews they had and the Yelp rating. I ordered the seafood platter for $26 and it all tasted bland and fishy. Even the fries :(. The hurricane was the best thing I ordered. They serve it in dry ice so it comes out bubbling and smokey. Looks pretty cool. The service was decent and to give the server credit, she did reccomend getting anything blackened but I didn't listen to her. Either way for $100 meal I left feeling ripped off and disappointed. Definitely will not go back."

Told the hostess, didnt matter.  Also asked hostess & serverz to move us, ""couldnt, no more seats"", yet people coming in, seated all around us, in the ""no more seats"" areas.  Also got to watch oyster shuckers, professionals at their kraft-will guve them that, but talk about dirty, if raw oysters make you ill, look at the shuckers & oyster prep area, what a gross mess.

A06ESi6XstQBOvrn_9mIxg,,,"The raw oysters were a little chewy and overall, not the greatest.  They were big, that's good, but not slide down the throat, that's bad.  They weren't very flavorful, that's bad, but I was drunk, that's good.  I would go somewhere else for raw oysters."
A0KXiEeL0QsjDTo__rdCqw,,,The line was so long but the the red beans and rice was worth the wait the service was ok and the rest of the food on the menu was ok the drinks was good but if you are in party of 4 or less your wait for your food once you order is so long

Jambalaya - nothing special, it wasn't bad but it didn't stand out either. 

Service: very attentive, but they get so busy that they will squeeze additional parties in with your table if there is room. They put a party of 2 to sit at our 8-person table with our party of 6.","Had a large group of 17 and we waited about an hour in their make shift line outside. Aside from our hiccup of waiting for a large table to clear up, once we got seated, the service was wonderful. They took our appetizer and drink orders first and were very systematic about it. We got the famous oysters and the crab cakes appetizer. They were both delicious. The oysters were coated in parmesan sauce which gave it a creamy taste. I got the Cajun jambalaya pasta and it didn't disappoint - creamy and slightly spicy with that Cajun creole flavor I was craving. They even split our checks individually for seventeen people! Overall amazing service and amazing food. This place may not be as popular as the other bigger names such as acme but it has a LOT of room and the food is great!"

A5FVwtSVdno7P3sZktiztA,"I waited in line for three hours just to order food tonight. This food is absolutely delicious, however there MUST be a better system than the way in which orders are taken to get a line moving faster. When I got to the front of the line I found that there was only one cashier in charge of serving a line around the block. That man deserves a freaking medal. I totally understand the hype surrounding this place but I hope this review can serve to help build a business that can move more efficiently and in turn gain an even better reputation.",,
A5R9Fpsa7Ka7zI6thqxaEg,"**UPDATE 11/7/2020**
Ok so we tried it again today and leveled up to Damn Hot - much better. Lots of flavor and a good amount of heat. If you like and can do spicy, I suggest doing Damn Hot. Still not as spicy as Hot level at Bolton's but 'mo betta quality!

 If you're cray, cray then try Shut the Cluck Up.

**11/6/2020**
The chicken is good but the spicy level seems to be off. We tried Hot and thought it was super mild. Good flavor but very mild - no eyebrow sweat!

Full disclosure, we tried Bolton's first and got spicy level Hot - that was pure fire. Lips felt like they were sunburned!

Perhaps next time we will go one level up to Damn Hot",,
A5T8ey1_3nQzopV0PcCmIQ,"There is an hour wait outside of this establishment.  I didn't think it was going to be worth it.

It was super hot outside and the only tables were outside (inside was full).  I didn't think it was going to be worth it.

Ordered the Medium Hot chicken.  It was worth it.

The medium is like using Louisiana Hot Sauce but better.  I would go back, but order to go and eat at the bar top.  Tables are reserved for dine in customers.",,
A6_xNk8TxxHGAqoBOLdnGQ,,"This place was a total letdown.

It was SO loud and it smelled really bad inside. The service was mediocre at best. 

I did like the grilled oysters, they were tasty and cooked right. 

The crab cake was ok, but a lot of filler and really bready and not enough sauce. The po-boy was just ok: there are much better places to get poboys. Etouffe was ok, again nothing special.

Maybe I'm spoiled because I live nearby think there are LOTS of places with better oysters/Cajun-Creole food for better prices.",
A6iKNXEJGgFEdmaHTSindw,"Must try in Nashville. Even the ""Hot"" was plenty hot, and the tenders were juicy and delicious. Sweet tea is great!",,

A7igVtyYA4A86HVJM0Rn0A,,,What an amazing place. Second time I try oysters and unlike my first experience I loved it. The crab cake was also great. But definitely try their special oyster the sauce is to die for. They are also open late which is great.
A7uNMKd0CgEiuORyxVaB9Q,"Since I was passing through Nashville, I obviously had to try Nashville hot chicken. All the reviews led me to Hattie B's.

I was worried that I wouldn't even get to try this place since the popularity meant long wait times and I was on a strict schedule for my road trip. Luckily, Hattie offers online ordering for same day pickup. I have no idea if there's a limit on those time slots, but I ordered while I was still in Virginia, about 4 hours out. 

I arrived 30 min before my scheduled time and had no problem finding parking even though it's a tiny lot. They told me they were too busy to move my order up so I left to fill up the car and came right back. Still no trouble finding parking. 

They brought the food right out to my car but forgot one of our sauces. My meal looked better than my family's, maybe tasted better too since I got medium while they got mild and country. Overall, the spices didn't give much flavor and the chicken tasted increasingly saltier as it cooled. 

They gave the slaw on the side even though I didn't request it that way. Maybe a courtesy for takeout orders. The slaw was seriously lacking. 

The pimento mac was delicious but overcooked. Maybe they need to make smaller batches so it's not sitting long. 

Glad to try this place, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it again.",,
A870_fiE0TLsdk-qbumavw,"I love fried chicken and now I love Hot Fried Chicken. I had the large dark plate, half medium heat and half hot heat. Don't be scared of the heat level as the hot was very bearable. Red potato salad was perfect side with the chicken. Service was excellent as servers were constantly moving around making sure you had what you needed.",,
A89VAV5WG6zrYrYjMS4q8Q,,,"ThIs place was super . We went during the weekend when the Niners played the Saints and it was just absolute pandemonium everywhere! I ordered food via yelp and I was so zonked out from partying, I fell asleep and didn't get to pick up my food! Lol! Anyway, I called the restaurant the following morning and told them of the situation. They told me it was all gravy and to just come in to the restaurant and let the person working know the situation. I get there later that evening after partying and shenanigans again on Bourbon...I actually had to explain to several people about the situation. I ran into some headwind, but eventually the gentleman obliged and went to the back to have my order remade. We got the baby back ribs, the Cajun pasta, and gator bites. Loved the ribs and man that pasta!!! Not a fan of gator bites so that's that. But I will say this, the New Orleans folk are wonderful beautiful people inside and outside. Their level of hospitality and genuine consideration is second to none. I will always remember this NOLA trip forever and ever. See you guys again in the future!"
A8BMl32898Uqryd1MjMS9A,,,"It was our first night in New Orleans and our flight came in a little late.  Not wanting to waste our first night, my friends and I hit the French Quarter to look around, grab a few drinks, and get a bite to eat.  We didn't really know where to start so we looked on Yelp to find a place that had a variety of offerings so that we could get a feel for what we might have to look forward to during our trip.  

We ordered the crab cake appetizer, fried shrimp platter, fried seafood platter, and a couple of Hurricanes and Swamp Tea to drink.  The food was fine.  You really can't go wrong with fried seafood & fries, the crab cakes were filling and satisfying, and the drinks were refreshing.  All in all, a solid first meal for a couple of hungry tourists.    

Though he kept forgetting our order, our server was friendly and it was fine that he left us alone to enjoy our food for most of the time.  The biggest plus was that the restaurant was quite large and we didn't have to wait for a table."

A8S38KY7VN2vv417JSmA-g,,This is absolutely one of my favorite stops in New Orleans. We came here for lunch the line was forming outside already but with a party of eight we were able to get a seat fairly quickly. I would say about 3 minutes if my entire group was there. The chargrilled oyster is delicious. We had three dozens. I could've had another order but I don't wanna be too greedy and the meter was up. A must have if visiting New Orleans.,
A8pAA0k6Y9LigCnn6h-5nA,"Got the hot chicken breast which was spicy and juicy as advertised. Sides are just okay, but you really go there for the chicken. It's worth the long wait times, apparently ordering before hand is best way to beat waiting in line.",,

A9ZYAy81XWfQnubt02uIPw,,"If you want good raw oysters, walk next door and eat at Bourbon House.

The raw oysters at Acme are huge!  They are also flavorless blobs that leave you completely unsatisfied.  I would never eat them again.

However, after they got the grill working again, I ordered the grilled oysters with butter and cheese.  I most definitely would return for those.  They took those aforementioned blobs of goo and grilled them in butter with cheese.  A killer combination for sure, but everything tastes better with butter and cheese!

Note, I sat at the bar and tried to engage the shuckers in conversation.  Never met a more surly bunch.  Just really no good reason to go to Acme in my opinion...",
A9y1QMO1NcCYjngLlx4xPw,We got there about an hour after opening and waited online for about 1.5hrs. It is not covered and can be very hot depending on the day. Overall the chicken tastes good and the portion was fair. I found out you can order ahead which is a great way to beat the wait and the heat. I don't think I would wait online in the future and would order ahead.,,

I would totally give them 5-stars except it's a pain in the butt to get there and almost makes it worth the extra $30-40 for delivery. Best hot chicken place in Nashville,,

AAWRUJmIpmGc0_rd6TBbfQ,,"The line here can be pretty brutal (went to Felix's across the street the first time we tried to go here because the line was too long) but we came back during an off hour on a Sunday and it wasn't too bad. Only waited about 10 minutes and sat at the bar. We ordered Fresh, Iced Oysters and Chargrilled Oysters. The fresh oysters were soooooooo good! Super fresh and plump. You know an oyster is fresh when it almost has a sweet taste to it and doesn't feel slimy or snotty when you're eating it. This was as snack for us so we shared half a dozen but I could've easily eaten a whole dozen on my own. I watched the guy next to me down 2 dozen on his own and he was ordering another dozen as we were leaving. I was jealous of him. The chargrilled oysters are good but I think Felix's wins the battle on this one. Although it was tasty enough, since I already had Felix's chargrilled oysters I felt these were missing that extra charred flavor that Felix's has. I do think the oysters here are bigger though even though I read somewhere that they are the same suppliers. I would definitely recommend Acme Oyster House if you have the time to wait in line...or better yet, just go when the line isn't too bad...we went around 3pm when it clearly wasn't a popular hour to eat.",

They are so good, I could probably eat a dozen by myself! I also had the half shrimp po boy and seafood gumbo, both were delicious. But by far the star of the show are those charbroiled oysters. 

I came during lunch time on a Tuesday and sat at the bar so there was no wait for me. However there seemed to be a short wait for those wanting tables. The service was wonderful. Curtis, the bartender did a wonderful job. I already have plans to return before I leave.",

ABYJ_vl-sFVUC8Yj4uv1QQ,,"We've heard good things so we decided to pay a visit. We were just about to leave because the line was looking like a two hour wait but the hostess told us they had two seats at the bar. We took them quickly making our overall wait time less than five minutes.

We take a seat and were immediately greeted by two friendly bartenders (who's names I sadly, don't remember).

We tried a half-dozen of the charbroiled oysters since we weren't sure if we'd like them but let me tell you, a half dozen was NOT enough. It was one of the best things I've ever eatten!

We had the seafood platter (catfish, shrimp, and oysters) with fries and hushpuppies which was also great!

Along with the amazing food and wait-staff we were poured some excellent drinks which were not light on the alcohol. We also drank few differnet drinks that the bartender had created herself. (she knew what she was doing!)

We ended up paying around $100 for the two of us.  (A dozen charbroiled oysters, two seafood platters, and 3 drinks each alomg with tip.)

ABlSOquUAEYSUvySN0AeXw,,"Acme is an icon off Bourbon Street. We waited in line about 30 minutes drinking our Hurricanes and enjoying the great 70 degree weather.

We were told we would have to toss our drinks by the person monitoring the line. She was like a drill sergeant. She even skipped over some people who had Fish Bowls but then later told them they could come in if they dumped it. I get it but she was a bit harsh.

The line went fast and soon we were greeted by our server.  We started with 6 raw and 12 chargrilled oysters. 

The raw oysters were massive, meaty, and tasty. Compared to our California Hogs Island, these Gulf oysters were cleaner tasting and zero slimy texture. Next were the Chargrilled with butter, garlic and Parmesan Cheese. Like anywhere else we have had them, they were good meaty oysters, cooked well. A nice pile of soft bread comes with the dish so you can dip yo bread. I dipped hard and dipped often!

Up came the main course of Shrimp Étouffée which was really good with a nice sauce that was thick enough to hold the rice and shrimp together like Sonny and Cher or Tony Orlando and Dawn (you millennials can Google that one!). I liked the dish.

The massive crab cake the size of a bread plate arrived. It's just a crab cake with no garnish, no sauce, nothing.  The crab cake was thick but abundant with crab. This dish was a bit on the dry side for me as this was a very dense cake, compared to lighter, more crumbly cakes I have had elsewhere. This dish was just ok for me.

Finally the Crawfish Boil special arrived and did not disappoint. These bugs were big and delicious. Nice amounts of seasoning were used for the boil as you get a good shot of that boil with each suck of the Crawfish head. Not too spicy.

Noise level was a 9 out of 10 but I found this to be the norm on any restaurant near or on Bourbon Street.

AC-A_c6GLpt6Og1jQj7bTQ,"First off- my boyfriend and I came to Nashville for 2 nights and we ate at Hattie B's...both nights. 

i seriously cannot say how much i love hot chicken now that i've had such an authentic taste. This restaurant's outdoor patio is perfect, it's hilarious seeing all the bachelorette pedal bars coming by screaming WOOO!! The ambiance and music are amazing in the evening underneath the string lights. 

The food is well worth the wait, both evenings we stepped up our heat levels, i was pleasantly pleased by the hot level and had plenty of nose wiping to do. My boyfriend pressed his luck the last night and opted for the Damn Hot- took him 45 minutes of snot and tears to finish but he said it was well worth it so i could not imagine ever doing the Clucking Hot. 

Only downside is their drink machines are kind of a pain when it's crowded- it doesn't flow well- not the machine the functionality. Also the floors are very sticky inside by the machines, but hey, what do you expect, right? 

Great place to check out!!! I literally can't wait to go back",,
AC9poOv9mgPngKC2ItbCtg,,,Food is good. Have really good drinks and food come out very hot and fresh compared to most restaurants. Only reason I am giving 4 out of 5 is because their greens are frozen and I expected the mardi gras pasta to be a bit more flavorful considering this is NOLA. Overall service was good.

I usually don't really eat shell fish or seafood in general because of allergy and personal preference, but I tried the sauce on the grilled oyster on a piece of bread and it's sooooo flavorful!

I ordered half po boy with fried fish (don't want to order chicken at a seafood restaurant lol) and it's delicioussss! On the side I've got hush puppy and it's pretty good as well! 

We shared a fries with their beef gravy and cheese - arg it's so good too!!!

The waitress delivering the chicken told him he was going to regret his decision, we laughed. He was surprised at the heat it offered. He was sweating, eyes watering, and feeling the heat in the first piece. He asked later what the used to find it was ghost peppers.

Love the collard greens here. The Mac and cheese is ok...
Local beers on tap. Paper towels on the table, enclosed outdoor patio. Casual picnic. The chicken is fried fresh to order, so it can take a while; but they have an online ordering system or you can call in your order.

I ordered the 3 wing meal with Mac & cheese, and coleslaw as my sides, the peach cobbler, and the large dark meal with no sides.  I ordered both meals super clucking spicy, after having howling rays secret menu nothing scares me anymore.  The super clucking spicy wings were delicious, soo spicy, and a little salty, I wish I had ordered some fries to balance out all the saltiness.  I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw, it wasn't vinegary enough for me.  The pimiento Mac & cheese was delicious though, next time I will be ordering a large size of it.  The peach cobbler was warm, and had a weird after taste, I'm not sure what it was but it wasn't strong enough that it overpowered the deliciousness of the cobbler.

We also had the alligator bites (chewy) and crab cakes. The sauce on the crab cakes was the best part of the meal. Just bottle and sell that. Put it on eggs, Mac and cheese, whatever. It's like cheesy, saucy goodness with some mushrooms for good measure.  

I'm not sure some of the patrons can actually taste anymore. Many are obliterated on various concoctions in adult sippy cups. I'm all for people having a great time - heck, it's NOLA. But 5 stars?! I imagine the regret the next day on those reviews is real, like noticing your dog was sniffing your neighbor's dogs excrement and then is licking your face like a prime rib bone on Christmas.

AGdCh57cZxVansHWrTjZaA,Food was awesome and the service was great too. I love the atmosphere. Bathroom was also very clean.,,
AGl0QrZnBNDLm4Y_5GEglw,,,"We ordered take-out from Oceana!  We ordered their famous crab cakes appetizer, oyster poboy, blackened redfish topped with crawfish cream sauce, and barbecued shrimp!  Delicious Cajun Cuisine!"
AGraTma9eEgsiJFDIy6tbg,,"Yes, this place has become very touristy since I last went there, but you cannot beat a dozen huge oysters on the half shell on the cheap -- along with some fried catfish, hush-puppies, coleslaw and a couple pints of Abita beer! We were smiling from ear to ear! 

The front door person and hostess seemed like they were power tripping for some odd reason, but whatever, just give me them oysters!",
AGs3E2QfaqQj_iovq076Tg,,,Best Gumbo in town I love how it has the smokiness from the bell peppers and the onions. Highly recommend if you're in the area. I tried alligator meat the first time here the waiter insisted and it was actually pretty good. Fun experience definitely would come back when I'm in the area.
AH0RBBpGok-2P0rIvN8EPA,,,Quick delivery to our hotel in the French quarter. Food was excellent. Blackened alligator bites were the best
AH8wv5undKcUIc26BpBKRg,We arrived 40 minutes before opening time. The service was great! Our food arrived quicker than we expected. We had the chicken and waffles with pimento mac n cheese & red potato salad. My chicken southern style and my husband had it mild. The mild had a little kick. Their natural lemonade was great!,,
AHPQKExp290YIwL6pHGJrg,,I love me some oysters! I can eat at least two dozen and be a happy Louisiana girl.,
AHi0ZeAoiBFro_ZO-mUT7w,,Every time I come tj New Orleans I come here for crawfish and chargrilled oysters. This time was no different. There is a wait to be seated if you have  a large group but I was alone so ingot seated right away and had greasy service. Don't let the line intimidate you if you go. It is worth the wait!,
AHmZGplnkQKBptHD4tz3ZA,,"The Chargrilled oysters are awesome! You have to try the pecan cobbler with ice cream even if you are not in the mood for dessert. It will put you in the mood for dessert and I guarantee you will not leave a morsel behind. The prices are very reasonable. The only drawback is that they only offer Tobasco sauce for hot sauce instead of Louisiana Hot Sauce, Crystals or Franks. The cocktail sauce is horseradish based. I'm not a fan of horseradish. But if you are, you will love it. The atmosphere is laid back and comfortable and the customer service is nice.",
AHoHT3OzVxWfV1UY1zvWdg,,,"The food was fantastic and the vibe was chill. Our food delivery goddess, Sierra, was amazing! She was super friendly and funny and made the experience even better. 10/10 would return!"
AHvnrDfBqqgrvF7-qI_c1g,"Best chicken in the world. There's nothing that compares. Fact. It's perfect, and if you don't visit this place, you're missing out!

I never thought spicy could be so addicting. After my first taste 6 years ago, I still haven't tasted any chicken that compares to this place. And the price is so cheap too! How do they even do that?!

It's literally amazing how much love and dedication they put into this place. Easiest 5 stars I've ever given.

If you're from Texas, just so you understand, this is like the Franklin BBQ of Nashville. Oh mah gahh.",,
AIGpDF99IUxpc7An8QMkCw,,"I love this place.
I wish it seated 600 people though!

Food is great but I almost always feel rushed. Not by the staff but because there is frequently a line outside and I feel like I want everyone to have some!

A must visit whenever I am in town.",
AIMkbFvY1_IUI9S02xJj9A,,"We stayed in New Orleans for nearly an entire week and sampled a lot of local food. But hands done, the food at Acme Oyster House was the best. It's a no-frills, low-budget place where the people who know wait in lines along the sidewalk for a coveted table. There is nothing fancy about this place. The waitstaff is nice but all business. The cutlery and dishware is standard diner material. But the food....goodness gracious...the food is delectable. Do not pass your chance to have their grilled oysters. They are so good. Plus, I can say with clear conscience that their seafood etouffee was the best in town. I sampled the dish at several places but none could compare to the depth of flavor as the one at Acme Oyster House. If you are in town and looking for a low-key, delicious meal then check them out.",
AIQRKl2Jzo56CZNUbtPVqA,,,Fiona our server was soooo cute. She was so helpful and kind. She brought us anything we needed and did not forget about us. The best!
AIgG2rbJHMdVFv6BO64TVQ,"It's a good indicator that the chicken is good when the line is out the door at 4:30.
As we were in line we were advised by a local as to what we should order. This was helpful.
There is southern style with no heat and all the way up to shut the cluck up that is extreme heat. I opted for mild, husband medium(could have done hot) and the kids southern style. We each got 2 sides with our 3 jumbo strips including pimento mac and cheese and potato salad, which were delicious, greens and HOT beans. We also got banana pudding that was off the hook. 
I loved the build your own teas and lemonade! I had unsweet, a little sweet and topped it off with lemonade. 
You grab a table after you order, no holding tables. I was happy there was an empty table waiting, phew!
As my teens said, it was hip and lit. 
4 thumbs up!",,
AJHLqQ6EwGYy-UzggHJEEQ,,,"So, we found this place on accident, with Yelps help, and we were very happy we did.  We tried to go to a few different places before, and they all had fairly long lines, so we kept walking and yelp helped steer us here.

We hesitated at first, as it seemed, ""Dennyish"", but we were hungry and there was no line.

All hesitation washed away quickly, as every part of our breakfast was very solid at worst to great at best.  The service, the food, the pace, even the feel of the place.

Our food was great.  I had a crawfish omlet and my wife had french toast, which was also great.

Our servers were super friendly, as was the busser and the manager who stopped to check in.

I started this review completely planning to write a 4 star review, as I usually save 5's for places that wow me.  Nothing really wowed me about this place, but looking back on it, I don't see any reason to knock a star off. 

They were even super gracious in taking 10% off for the yelp checkin coupon."
AJNqywCtnoMAlDf6gbYcOg,,,"Great chargrilled oysters. Decent drink selection.  Fast and courteous service no matter how crowded. So far have tried 3 different entres, ranging from seafood to steak,  and have not been disappointed yet. The bread pudding dessert was fresh and really good."
AJfu6Pqq9HRMx6ADvkC3xQ,"Had read about princes online, but that was a 25-min cab each way, while Hattie's was a 3 min walk from Vanderbilt hotels. Yelp showed incredible reviews, and we felt the same. Delicious chicken, with mac and cheese on the side that was some of the best I've ever had.",,
AK2b-jsWG7UuXqVUJ9tc2A,,"This place has been here forever and always has a line out the door.  So, imagine my good fortune when at 8:30pm on Halloween, on my way to a party, I'm walking by and there is no line.  I took that as a sign that I needed some oysters.  I sat at the bar, talked to some interesting visitors and inhaled the first dozen.  I then savored the second dozen, and finished with 6 baked. (Unfortunately, those were overdone!).  There are other things to eat at Acme, but it's an oyster house for good reason.  It is busy, loud, touristy, a little shabby, but still the place to have a few.  I will be there each time I am in New Orleans, because it is a ritual now.",
AKCjKMJ2h18ai_2PmgGeUQ,"Although this place is extremely busy, the staff remain composed, respectful and helpful. Southern hospitality at it's best!  Thank you. Without comprising the exterior crunch, the wings and tenders are well seasoned, juicy and TENDER! Delicious!",,
AKJBlJl_ZEP18jFcrbh84Q,,"Acme was pretty good. I'd go back. I can't give a higher rating because it is dark, crowded and loud. But I would say it's pretty good. The food is nice and the staff are lively. A pretty good experience all around.",
AKMN_6Tdako5ISZ00JfA2w,,,The place aligns with the New Orleans culture and the atmosphere is great. The meal was perfection and the staff was  wry accommodating. I have made it my mission to eat here at least once when I'm in town. I look forward to my next trip.
AKTT2jyiEr6pLF51M-MGzg,,,"Wow! This place was recommended by our tour guide and I'm so glad we went! The ambiance was great and the service was too. It was my first taste of NOLa food, and I left there so satisfied, that we ended up going back a second time! I had the Jumbalaya pasta. It was wonderful! A huge plate of food, that I unfortunately couldn't finish... it was heartbreaking. I can't take too much spice, but the spice on this was just right. (If you're looking for spices, you may have to asked them for a little extra). My brother had an Oyster Po'boy, fried crawfish and crawfish etoufee. He was very satisfied!
The restaurant is in the french quarter and close to everything, so it's a good stop on your way to party.

The second time around, I had the crab cakes. They were so big that, it's all I ordered. They were delicious! The best I've ever had!

A definite must do when in NOLa!!"
AKc1anx1qGCe3Fy6U3NtZA,,,"Oceana is the best place for brunch in the FQ. We came everyday. They had the best gumbo and étouffée I've ever had! This being my first trip to NoLa and all. The first time both dishes were hot and full of seafood! I almost had to change my panties it was so good! Came back the next day (Monday) and ordered the same thing. Whomp whomp. It was barely warm, watery, and barely a shellfish in sight. I guess we had the leftovers, which wasn't much, and they added water to make a serving. I was too hungry to care or send it back. So I subtracted a star. But still go there and order these dishes, just ask when it was made."
ALC83xxe9Tguk3u5abl9aw,,"We went on a Monday night and were told that the wait was 45 minutes for a table, but we only waited for about 20-25 minutes. We ordered the jambalaya and fried catfish were both excellent. The catfish had the perfect amount of batter, not too much, not too little. The waitress was super friendly. They do not split checks here.",
ALCxAt7aKEn5C6R6arzYig,,,"This restaurant is actually pretty big with multiple floors. I think the environment is pretty good and staff were nice, my review reflects my particular experience with the food itself. Came here to eat some seafood, tried the combination seafood player and was pretty disappointed. The seafood itself didnt taste very fresh but more importantly how can you serve a fried dish cold? That means you basically just fry a bunch of stuff and left it there for a while. At least refry it a bit to let patrons enjoy warm food."
ALNUwFXAHXmFeQ9V2gCTfA,"Oh. My. God. 

Hubby and I got three tenders & two sides meals. Hubs got mild and said it was super flavorful. I got medium - heat was comparable to mild buffalo sauce which was perfect with pickles and bread that come with the meal. 

Sides - we wanted to try them all but went with:

-Bean salad: my favorite. My Great Gram made a 3 bean salad and this reminded me of it. 
-Pimento Mac: creamy and delish, but little different style. I like Mac a little bit more noodley with thicker sauce. Still good. 
-Potato Salad: so freaking delish. Perfect all around with a bacony flavor. 
-Cole slaw: hubs and I agree, meh. Splurge on other sides :)

Got the kiddos banana pudding. One order was good for 2 kiddos - we over ordered. Very thick & rich. 

This place was no joke. Line out the door and all. They do online ordering so you can pick up and eat your yummy goodness at the park or your hotel (like we did). 

I will dream of this place...",,
ALj3JMyGnVWheJ5IuPNdiA,,Worth the wait.  Sit down with an appetite and share with the table.  Everything is really well made and the taste is true.,
ALj8pXYG9MKtd4CoU6WNfw,,"I am a loyal customer of ACME OYSTER COMPANY....on Iberville at Bourbon

Here are some personal highlights...

*community tables are fun, standing in a long line outside should be fun and you should encourage a communal gathering
*Portions are large, read the menu...you'll find fried foods...you'll discover broiled oysters
*Prices are well below other seafood meals in NOLA 
*I've always had extremely professional, attentive and deserving of high gratuity wait staff....ask questions because they like to share their favorites
*Bread Pudding....Bread Pudding
*Thoughts like...consistent, welcoming, quality, professional, inviting are key to me

Baby, I love the smell of freshness and how it triggers my tastebuds.....

Edit begins here...

2 DAYS LATER AND I'VE RETURNED.....because of friends recommending the CHARGRILLED OYSTERS I did go back for them.     A dozen freshly sucked, chargrilled in the half shell oysters with garlic, butter, parmesan cheese et al is a hit.   PLEASE TRY THEM OVER THE RAW.

Personally, I prefer the RAW....these were unlike Amy I've had before.....they were so so so rich that it really was too much for me.   

I ALSO ROLLED AWAY A FAT HAPPY MAN AFTER A CUP OF THE OYSTER ROCKEFELLER SOUP.....I can't believe that this could be replicated...thick and creamy, adequate spinach, extremely large fried OYSTER....a definite must for me from this point forward.",
AM7Z60l9kxA-X_oqK7jLBg,,"We came here because my husband cousin can't stop talking about this place. She said if she could eat here everyday she would. She recommended the chargrilled oysters and fried soft shell crabs omg she is so right it was best we ever had in Louisiana. The long wait tells you have great the food here. We waited for so long to be seated but its all worth it. Hush puppies, potato fries, fresh oyster, bread pudding for dessert hmmm it was all good. My mouth waters thinking about it now. I can't wait for our next trip back to new orleans. I wish we have Acme here in Tucson.",
AMTjQzWR3V7q0TGiqTKlkA,"Was totally awesome! On our way back from seeing Hank3! Beer and chicken sounded awesome :)  Had a couple PBR's and a 'half chicken' It was super moist and the breading was out-a-this world!!! We also had the Mac and cheese which was kinda weak. (Only reason I rated a four star) Will be back! If your in Nashville gotta check it out!! 

Cheers!",,
AMlG4aXYVuzP7jdArpPXlQ,"This place is great! There are 800+ other reviews raving about the food, but I wanted to add something on about the service...

My partner and I came here with a friend, and although we ordered before her, she got her food first--we waited another 20 minutes or so, when she was pretty much done with her dinner, until we caught the eye of one of the guys delivering food to tables. He sent his manager over, and the manager apologized profusely for losing our order in the crazy shuffle that is Saturday night, and brought our food over with three free desserts and beer! We were definitely a little frustrated up until that point, since we had waited an hour in line and another 45 minutes for our food to appear and we were ravenous. But hey--free beer, banana pudding, and peach cobbler made it right in our book. Thanks, Hattie B's!",,
AMmjKbKKSSiffwBITGbcEw,,"We came on a Saturday with 6 people around 3 had to wait for an hour but we were so excited to have oysters from here we didn't care, while we waited several street musicians came by one was playing a saxophone which sounded terrible. But it was okay! Once we came in we waited like 5 minutes to get our drink order taken which is okay seeing as they were full and our server hot sat 4 tables in like 10 mins... We order the boo fries which were recommended in a few reviews on here, they were not amazing or even great they were simply good, I probably wouldn't get them again unless they were complimentary, then our raw oysters came...

It was life changing. The oysters were massive! They were so plump!!! Normally you find them all wet and slimy but these oysters were so plump and amazing they taste so delicious they definitely deserve 5 stars on their own! We ended up getting 2 dozen raw oysters! Then after the raw oysters we got some char grilled oysters which were great as well but not as good as the raw oysters. We also got the seafood platter which had fried oysters which rocked my world! If you go to acme I would definitely recommend the oysters and the seafood platter! The 6 of us ended up sharing 2 dozen raw oysters, one dozen char grilled oysters, an order of boo fries, the seafood platter, a single serving of bread pudding, and 6 oyster shooters. Our Bill was $150 after our $20 tip. Which was decent seeing as there were 6 of us. We all left pretty full :) the food came pretty fast and our server was as good as she could be seeing as she most likely hadn't sat down her entire shift.",
AMrhEi4bLvaAcC2XggeBsg,,Absolutely delicious seafood! This restaurant definitely lives up to all the hype. I had the chargrilled oysters with herb butter sauce and topped with cheese as well as the soup of the day which was lobster bisque. The food here is incredible fresh and you can actually sit at the bar and watch oysters being shucked right in front of you. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who visits New Orleans!,
AMud0SEe0kBK6aCdtPWzqw,"Definitely a good hot chicken spot. 
But I will say two things:

A) There are definitely better Hot Chicken spots in Nashville. (Slow Burn, Subculture, Hurts, Pepperfire, 400 Degrees, etc.) 
But this place is a solid choice due to the consistency and professionalism of the people that work there. 

B) Hattie's is 100% a tourist trap, and as a result, the line is always out the door at every location. 
I would thoroughly recommend ordering on their website so that you can skip the line and take your food to-go. (This will save you a solid 30-45 minutes.)

Overall, definitely worth checking out even though there is better Hot Chicken in Nashville.",,
AMxmNyE2JzbapIUO69YzuA,,"Okay, this place has like a million reviews and the line is out the door. I'm sure you're thinking, this place is absolutely touristy but in actuality, this place was BOMB. The wait is worth it. Actually, to make you feel better, the host is so organized that she will come out of the restaurant walk down the line in the cold and will write your names down, the number in your party, and which table seating you would prefer. Because she does all that, you maybe 10 up but if there is a table for 2 that is available NOW, you save like 25 minutes! So we really only waited like 30 minutes instead of the infamous ""hour wait"". Acme is located one block of Bourbon st. So what I suggest to do is make your wife or someone weaker than you wait in line and you go to a bar near by, meander your way through the crowd, get some beers and bring it back in line because in New Orleans you can drink on the street. Time flew so fast and the southern hospitality of the people in line really creates great company while waiting. The food was absolutely delicious. Everything you imagined this place served, they made for us. Softshell crab, charbroiled oysters, crab legs....fries. They also served PURPLE HAZE beer which is basically purple drink in beer form. SO GOOD. CHARDBROILED OSYTERS were the best we ever had! The attention and detailed put into making these oysters were so good, we ordered another batch even when we had a bunch of food on the table. Our server DaVon (?) was so amazing, she was quick and sharp and you can tell she knew the menu like the back of her hand. She had a huge table next to us and she still got all our orders right. Touristy? A little. Amazing food? Yes Will you regret it? NO!","Came here late after our drinking because we wanted some oysters! We ordered an oyster plate and got some alligator sausages to munch on. The oyster plate was okay but it was originally supposed to come with this cheesy sauce and we didn't want the cheese, we feel that the oysters weren't at their full potential. The alligator sausage was okay. Our server was sweet though, she really took the time to explain the details of the menu and then gave us a to-go cup for our beer (which is so cool that you can do that in new Orleans!)"
AN2FDyLeoZkjZhlofo2VsQ,,Oh MY!!!  That's what I have to say about their Chargrilled Oysters.  A lil' bit of heaven on a plate.  Never in my life have I had anything like this and 2 out of 3 days we were in NOLA we had them 'cause we couldn't resist.  Everything we ordered there was delish.,
ANG4YcHCHjyp0hNc3N51ZQ,,Had the crawfish po-boy and it was DELICIOUS. Service was pretty fast for it to be so busy.,
ANGX3Sa8U4zbvLbiPCQ5JA,,"CURTIS the bar tender was a riot. Great to talk to full of suggestions, super polite, friendly and funny! I had half fired fish and shrimp platter. There was enough fish for two people and about 8-10 fairly big shrimp. The fish was fresh and fried to perfection, I got sweet potato fries that were delish too! My friend had the fried oyster sandwich and it wasn't much food for her and she's a small gal, she ended up eating the second piece of my fish, so if you're going HUNGRY just know that and order more. The man next to us ordered a dozen raw oysters and he raved to us how good they were and I saw how HUGE they were",

ANdgtfSAUIww2Pstp-yMqA,"Hot half chicken - perfectly seasoned with right amount of heat. Juicy. Red skinned potato salad - best ever. I mean evahhhh. Greens - perfect. Not too soggy, not to crunchy. Seasoned the way the South only seasons it. Carry out. Took 7 min from them taking order at 4:30 to walking out door. Exceptional. They were slammed.  Staff was helpful, courteous and friendly. Parking was tight. Premier Parking Lot available within 100 steps, but they offer carry out spots if they are not filled. Price was reasonable with no complaints.

We waited about an hour outside on a Wednesday night, which normally would have been fine, but the stench of their trash bins from the alley next to the line were pretty gross. After we got in, the service was attentive and friendly despite the crazy amounts of people. Our favorite thing we ordered were the chargrilled oysters; they were wonderfully seasoned and had fantastic flavor. Looking back, I wish we would've just ordered these. We got a few po' boys and a fried oyster platter, all of which were just okay. I would love to go back for their oysters, but I would be tempted to try a few other places that are less crowded.",

APBrAQokuGy5zCARWyuwLw,,,"My husband and I walked by this place a bunch of times with no real desire to go in. I don't know why, but for some reason their sign was off putting to us.  We ended up going because it was one of the few places open during the tropical storm and right across the street from the hotel. 

I'm so glad we made it to this restaurant! The service was great, we had Jamal. We started out with some drinks. The Ruby red was delicious!! We split the Cajun fries with blackened alligator and the jambalaya pasta. Boy, those Cajun fries are so good. We added the blackened alligator to it, and it's almost a meal! The jambalaya pasta was also good, but I could have just eaten the Cajun fries and I would have been very pleased!"
APwpzHx7Jm91ohPx7dyUMw,,,"The food is BOMB! Now, if you're here for Essence Festival be prepared to wait. I had a cup chicken and sausage gumbo and cat fish platter and couldn't finish all the fish. The gumbo got me full! The frozen strawberry margarita was good as well. No room for dessert."
AQA2144dzVsed820TLijKg,,"As the Yelp reviews and people waiting outside indicate, this place is as good as it gets.  My girlfriend, who absolutely abhors seafood, loved the food at Acme!  How can you eat the oysters at this place and leave feeling disappointed or disgusted?  You can't!

Luckily, the line outside moved quickly and in about 20 minutes we were seated.  Of course, we ordered the oysters; char-grilled as opposed to raw, since I compromised with my girlfriend.  Within a few minutes, a delicious plate of oysters was sitting in front of us waiting to be devoured.  Reluctantly and boldly, my girlfriend picked up a fork, loosened the meat from the shell, fastened it to the prongs, and ate it.  Surprisingly, she loved it and even had two.  We also had a plate of red beans and a ""peace maker"" po-boy, and these were awesome as well.  However, the story here is obviously the oysters; it is, after all, the reason why you dine at Acme Oyster House.  They know their oysters and they don't play around when it comes to making sure they are served perfectly...raw, grilled or fried.",
AQALrGOdocj2wb5n12loqw,Yum!  Worth the wait in line outside the door.  All the diners were friendly and visiting among ourselves as we all were from out of town.

Wings were huge and juicy.  Breaking tasty.,,

We are visiting New Orleans and we wanted to try some authentic cajun food. Our food was clearly microwaved before being brought to us and wasnt even hot lol. The alligator bites were good but not hot. I dont think any of their food is made to order. I would not order oysters from this place."

I just had the half oyster poyboy and cup of seafood gumbo.  I have to be honest when I say that Acme has a pretty good damn gumbo.  I find this hard to come by in a city deemed the ""Melting Pot"" of the South. Anywho, ice cold beer on tap and oysters. What else do you need in life?",

ARFM4LrI_zxogm1L29ZKng,,,"We came to Oceana the last time that we were in Nola and it was very good. A little pricier than some of the other spots but food was worth our time. Today, we only needed a little snack but didn't want any of the fried specialties of the area, so we went with a cup of seafood gumbo. Best choice of the day. We came in a shallow bowl/plate and served with 2 little slices of buttered bread and a pile of rice in the center.  There were big Gulf shrimp and crab throughout. All that was missing was the okra. Thoroughly enjoyed this quick bite and our server. Shaun, super nice. Will be back to Oceana for a regular meal before we go home."
AROKTcPuWEVtG_MA6KtTEw,,,"Usually when there is a line for an establishment the food is assumed to be pretty good. Me and the Mrs. Entered and was seated upstairs. A 7 minute wait for our server wasn't pleasant. The server was polite. Ordered a blackened shrimp po'boy, Cajun fries, and etouffe. 

Tell me how do you wait 20 minutes for cold food and upon complaining it takes less than 5 minutes to return with hot food? Answer...you microwave it. If there is one thing I despise is shortcutting quality especially if I'm paying for it. At the end of the day that's unacceptable and if the manager doesn't oversee that, it means that the standard is pretty low to be considered a top 10 restaurant in the USA. 

I wouldn't return."
ASCsE_Fl_7IzOEF55M_xTA,,,"Tyana was a fantastic server - she was attentive and friendly and gave us some really great food. The food was amazing. 10/10. Would return! Get the ultimate Bloody Mary. It was great. The fries - whoa. Unreal. Try the soft shell crab. It was great. I learned that it's actually not a different species of crab, but it's a crab who has just undergone the molting phase. So now you know! Get it. You won't regret."
ASH4bONpdw5V4L2mhCmxAA,,,OMG you have got to eat the crab cakes or the duck here both were fantastic!  The service was great even on a very busy Saturday.  The beer was cold and not terribly expensive and the Hurricane is not too sweet.  Overall the best meal we had in NOLA.
ASNStoSpWzhq64GYunBBKg,,,The food was amazing. Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. My waitress Bre took great care of me during my visit.
ASYAcVi7VHvDnKDA0sr3Kg,"I don't believe I've had fried chicken as good as this. No disrespect to my Mother, Grandmother and those whom I've encountered that may have thought their fried chicken was the best. It wasn't. Hattie B's chicken is so good I found myself going back over and over again. I also found their prices extremely reasonable. I can't say enough about this place. And their Banana Pudding!!?? Their ""championship"" Banana Pudding!? Absolutely delicious!! 

This isn't a review. I'm simply sharing an awesome food experience with the world around me. From California to Tennessee. This place ROCKS!!",,
ASatJBoaeXrYb3kpx8NZig,We got arrived at 10:30 there was a line already waiting to get in. Seating is at a premium as the building is small and some patio seating. The chicken did not disappoint. If you like hot this is the place for your hot chicken ! The sides I got crinkle fries and Mac and cheese. The fries were seasoned with spices and the Mac and cheese was heavenly! Will definitely stop back in when in town.,,
ASgFTKXA_E84xRhKSOuIBg,,,"Deanne, our server was so friendly and gave us the best recommendations. All of the staff was helpful and our food was delivered hot fresh and in record time! We are so glad we came here to try authentic southern ""Cajun"" food! Amazing! 

The Oysters Rockefeller are incredible!! I would recommend them to seafood lovers as well as nonlovers. The flavors are unbeatable!  

The barbecue shrimp was also a winner- but prepare to get splashed!"
ASofNUS7Hyii5Df4TWMkyA,,,"Excellent food and ambience.. We had crab cakes,  jambalaya,  shrimp po boys  and gumbo."
ATSgPBtU0RIM2l317hpVww,,"The food was really great! Especially the oysters. They were so fresh and thicccc!! The chargrilled oyster was slightly salty but still good. Would def come back in the future. 
Our server was also super nice and good at her job! She knew we wanted more food and recommended us good options.",
ATteiNcdLaYYs19BDususg,,"ACME is a fun, very casual place to enjoy other dishes as well like gumbo (really good) Po-Boys of various types (shrimp, fish, chicken, beef, etc), red beans and rice, jambalaya and more. We look forward to eating here every time we visit and really go for very specific dishes. 

Favorite place in NOLA to eat oysters on the half shell!  they are always shucked so nicely, the perfect temperature, fresh tasting (not fishy at all) and served with delicious condiments. 

I'm very picky about red beans and rice and Jambalaya and was minimally impressed by my dishes this weekend. They were both very bland. The sausage served with the beans and rice was extremely flavorful and spicy which I loved, but otherwise I probably won't order those a dishes again.

The PoBoys are super yummy and usually stuffed with whatever meat/seafood you select. we've tried the shrimp and the fish and both were delicious!

If you like bread pudding you have to try theirs. The flavor is phenomenal, however I could do without the raisins (not a big fan) and wished the texture was a bit ""breadier"" and not so mushy-none of it stopped me from eating the whole darn bowl though!!! 

Depending on time of day, there is usually someone at the front door letting people in as patrons leave, so expect a line sometimes. There is plenty of seating as the restaurant is pretty big. It's lively with chatter and music. There is a full bar in the front section and tvs throughout. 

Seafood restaurants are a dime a dozen in NOLA and people expect certain flavors from the dishes they order-NOLA Does a great job at representing the cuisine of this region and is definitely a place you should visit if you haven't already.",
AU8g92shJzlnXV_2CJ0ihw,,,Great service. I tried gator for the first time -- it was surprisingly delicious! Our drinks were great and waitress was phenomenal! Definitely on my list of places to stop in whenever I visit NOLA again.
AUE4nM2XHFmGESHNRwHyZg,,,Smelly New Orleans restaurant.  Dirty and in need of a good cleaning. Food is just ok as this place is all about location. Better places off the main drag.
AVGcCUTOqqPSFfgrGOE21A,,,"This place was fantastic. If you're looking for top notch seafood, look no further. Ask for Kim - she's the best."
AVgI1UgGLUT_hspU5F--QA,,"If you come here be prepared to stand in line. This was my second time and I think the charbroiled oysters are amazing accompanied by a beer. However, the rest of the menu is all fried food and poboys. Definitely somewhere you have to try when in New Orleans, but I will not be back a third time since there are other good places for oysters (I recommend GW Fins) that also have good entrees.",
AVlPC5AQX_qQMEf02H-wug,,"Love their raw oyster and fried fish. Although always need to wait for approximate 30 mins to be seated but still worthy. I gave four stars because the waitress put the wrong order for us. Otherwise, food and atmosphere were neat!",
AVpExFKoE6ttULv8EFKASg,,"We sat at a community table and loved the experience. Grilled oysters are a must, but the red beans and rice and gumbo are also great! Get a draft beer and enjoy!",
AW00RYO_5w5FjVqtTE5Atw,,"Of all the places we ate in New Orleans, this was my fav! The chargrilled oysters are AMAZING, and that's an understatement. We got there shortly after 11a on a Saturday and was able to be seated after about a 10 min wait. Seemed like perfect timing because once we were seated, the line quickly formed along the sidewalk. This is definitely the place to go for chargrilled oysters! They are the best, hands down! We also had fried fish, red beans and rice, and the fried shrimp and oyster platter. Those dishes were good but nothing compared to those chargrilled oysters!!",
AW1422Obbm8BVHytgyQWkA,,,"I was in town for a conference and we had dinner here one night. Our server Fiona was great! She provided some good recommendations as well. I had the redfish, which was very tasty. I think the sauce helped that quite a bit. The vegetables/sides were just average. My dinner companion had the taste of new orleans. This was a good choice to try a few different items. All were pretty good, but nothing spectacular. We had sazaracs for drinks (of course) and although they were good, the pour was not much, especially compared to other spots throughout the city that we had the same beverage. 

I would give it 3 stars because it wasn't anything that was ""amazing"" or ""to die for"" food wise or even drink wise, but I added a star because our service was great. Thanks Fiona!"
AWBqk9FbIexyaLMM2-bNqA,,"I travel at least once a year to New Orleans and this is usually a stop.  The food is top notch for what it is.  But the price is now a little high for my taste and the wait was obnoxiously long.  I can get substantially identical food in many other places nearby.  The seating is tight, but if I had an active audience like that I would have as many seats as possible too.

If this restaurant were anyplace else on the planet it would be at least four stars, but its not, its in the French Quarter.

Abita on tap is also a winner.",
AXhRaEx2WAeHZwczlAJQRQ,,"I visited Acme for my best friend's birthday and I was pleased with the food and the service. The wait time was not bad because we sat at the bar. The bartender/ waiter was pleasant and attentive. We had the chargrilled oysters and the seafood étouffé (large) with crawfish tail. The oysters were the best I've ever had, I would go back just for the oysters and order 2 dozens instead of one. We also ordered a cucumber martini which was very good and even though it didn't taste of alcohol it was pretty strong (which speaks volumes of the bartender's skills). I would recommend this restaurant and I will go back when I visit again for those oysters!",
AXm-mf55LoCBhrzoBtZgQg,,"If I had a last meal on earth, it would include Acme's chargrilled oysters. That is all.",
AY3GIgSGJ3xtDP3VEH22Eg,,,"Brunch with Josh is a must while in Nola. He will brighten your day, put a smile on your face and get you drunk all at the same time. Food was very good. Bottomless Mimosas and Mary's are a huge bonus. And if you're wonder why the place like ooks so clean it's all because of Farren's (?sp) eye for detail. It's a must stop!!"
AYSOgJKZKr5v9L7HfgOdzg,,This place was very very good. Long line outside the restaurant moved very quickly. Fried oyster was delish.,
AYT5S3fwj5R0rBmRjkK6_w,"This place lives up to the hype! The chicken is unbelievable, tender, spicy, hot, savory. It's the chicken sandwich you didn't know you needed. But now it's staying on my mind, like the ex you just can't get over. Also-- the best sweet tea in Nashville.",,
AY_cjY1bRAD-I_K11dYvOA,,,Stopped by in november  gumbo was excellent. Shrimp  was good but crawfish was small. Alligator blackened was good. I had the pecan pie which was microwaved with a soggy crust.when I complained to the manager he did nothing
AYdWDW88lh5cj35Hn1JWOw,Delicious hot chicken. I ordered medium spice and that was just perfect for me. The sides were great as well. Would come back to Nashville just to eat this!!,,
AYgwry-YLmyMGHmUJRX9Nw,,,"Excellent food, even better service. Jamal was the best server I've had in New Orleans. Definitely try the crab cakes and blackened gator bites."
AYwtxiYYUOQ5wg08Aui7Fg,,,"If you want a place that has some New Orleans specialities, this is the place. I loved the gator bites ; both blackened and fried. Their crab cakes and ribeye steak was also delicious. Po-Boys, gator, crab cakes; and different seafood alike - this place is pretty darn swell especially if you're not used to New Orleans cuisine. If you get Brad as a server, you're bound to have a fantastic time !"
AZAqLKXHZdw1Uw8BIIBapA,"Did you even go to Nashville if you don't go to this place? No you didn't go anywhere. This place is hands-down one of the best places that serves hot chicken. I had the white chicken and a size small. I got mac & cheese as a side obviously. I also got the peach cobbler which I highly recommend. Of course there's a line. Of course it does take some time for your food to come but that could be because you're salivating as you're waiting. However, this is one of the best fried chicken places I have ever been. This is a must see. This is the gold standard of southern fried food. Do not miss this place. There's plenty of stuff to do around the area so it's definitely worth checking out.",,
AZMSn04cth5WR4y6LrtSBA,,,"amazing!! minimal wait time for lunch! food is very good- we had the fried fish platter, the blackened catfish dinner, and the crawfish étouffée! all very great!!"
AZOWnmnshNmKv5fKWGEwaw,"The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of the long wait BUT that's due to the number of people, certainly not their lack of effort. The food was delicious and would certainly go back if I visit Nashville again. I will say, it's HOT. To be expected, but if you're not big on spicy food, keep in mild.",,
AZSCsrKw7R1mXOQRK-tI3g,"The chicken were no doubt good.  Would I stand in the hot sun for two hours good?  Hmmm, I don't know.  The hot chicken was good with good spice but also greasy.  The Mac and cheese were bland, black eye pea salad was so-so.  The fries were nice and crisp.  The 2 hour wait really left a less desirable feeling to go back to Hattie B's.  Especially after trying Puckett's grocery and restaurant.  Puckett's food is just as good if not better without the painful wait.  I would be more inclined to suggest Hattie's if they would improve their process..... the unlimited refill of sweet tea and lemonade was totally a plus when waiting in the sun with no cover whatsoever....",,
AZzX2pLJ-ZUyDiBNnQrVVQ,,,"The food was great! The prices were a little steep for my taste but hey, most seafood is! The only non star giving attribute was the loud and freezing cold atmosphere. We got the crab cakes and types of pasta dishes! The servings were small for delicious!"
A_JjcWkgLrvJS3Ct2aAH3A,"Without question, the best customer service I've ever experienced. And I've dined at 5 star restaurants. The hotel I was staying at gave me the wrong location to order from. So when I showed up they didn't have my take out order. And if you know this place, the walk-in line is around the block. So they not only put my new order in on the spot, they called the other location, canceled my order and gave me a refund! I wasn't expecting that. The hot chicken was incredible but they were just truly nice people and very customer focused. Wish I could give them 10 stars!!!",,
A_fK0SfUyjOF-ZUbqqxl4w,,,"It was a good place to catch a bite. We were a party of 5 so we ordered two platters and an appetizer. It came out fast. It was fresh, hot and yummy. Our lyft driver was the one who recommended this place to us."
A_m2NJRTF5rILSUt8jyBrw,"Good hot chicken.  I am still more inclined to get Prince's, but Hattie B's is typically less wait if you are in a hurry!",,
A_wJcAAWhvY2lXoLxgxaJQ,"My favorite hot chicken place in town! They are always busy though with a line out the door so I usually order ahead of time and pick up, there's a separate line for pick ups so you don't have to wait in the line. The chicken is always hot, crispy, and juicy with the right amount of heat for me. I usually get the hot level and it's definitely got some heat but not too much that you can't enjoy it. If you manage to get seats it's a nice place to hang with friends for beer and chicken. The location out West is usually more manageable than the midtown one, there's more parking and seating. The newest one on 8th ave I haven't been to yet but I hear it's hard to get parking there since it's next to a residential area.",,
Aa-y0DPl25Q1t_1Mdr4apw,,"This place is popular with tourists and for good reason. Very loud inside, but the service is fast. I went alone, and they put me at the end of the bar where they unload the trash, but that's after I got to skip half the line (woot) . Really liked the Char grilled oysters. I also tried them at Felix next door, but I like the ones that Acme because they're softer and you can really taste the texture. Also really liked the Etoufee.",
AahKUx6vGomtLwLaIommJQ,,,Great Cajun and creole food. Some of the best in New Orleans!
AatJiK2L2CKSK3P9whi8Lg,,,Decent place. Quick service. Not as outstanding as some of the places in the area but the quick service and ease of seating made up for it.
Ab13kzk6urFlyjgcLmHUZw,I have never had fried chicken before but this was amazing. We ordered pick up so never got to dine inside. Food was fabolous,,
AbIvRoRSmSw4V86LiLIfpw,Man oh man....Hattie B's has my entire country fried heart . Their sandwich is life changing and their pimento mac and cheese is what my dreams are made of. This is a MUST in Nashville and don't let the line discourage you...this is your Hot chicken destiny !  (A great tip from a Nashville local: order ahead online so you can sit on the bench and enjoy!),,
AbTQpLuG2KO5kdtYkQ93yw,,"I had wanted to try Acme on Saturday night but the line was out the door.  So on my way back from dinner tonight - I noticed there was no line and had to give it a try.  What a mistake it was!  I just ordered a half -dozen raw oysters and a beer.  The oysters had sand and debris - all six-  an they were not tasty.  I had oysters at Luke Restaurant and they were by far so much more exceptional! 

I didn't even bother
finishing the beer - just wanted to leave the place. Not worth the wait for the raw oysters.",
AbW_481683jXsZ_s_h0HsQ,"The place has over 2,000 reviews so I doubt I will tell you anything you don't already know.  It was freezing outside so there was almost no line (a win for us). The place is small with about 6 inside tables and a patio, but at 15 degrees it was down to only 6 useable tables.  If you think of it as fast casual, you will get the service model.  You order at the counter and food is brought out to your table (you can also order online and Togo).  I had the hot chicken sandwich, you can choose the spiciness of your bird (from none all the way to shut the cluck up).  I did hot and while spicy, I could handle it (and I am sensitive to spice).  My fiancé was starving so she go a half chicken also set to hot.  I ordered two tenders (at $1.50 each a total steal) one at damn hot and the other at shut the cluck up).  The heat really goes up from there.  I could barely finish the damn hot and the other felt like instant heartburn.  We also had some delicious apple cobbler and lemonade and sweet tea.  I felt the lemonade was better.  The service was good and the crew was hospitable.  Highly recommend!!!",,
AbaTtTAkBR-pcgxRaAtTuQ,,"Get the chargrilled oysters!!!! (Skip the Poboy)  We came here on vacation, and the line was down the block.  It moved pretty fast, and the wait just made the oysters taste so much more divine.  I begged to return every evening on our trip, but my husband wanted to try other restaurants.  At the end of the trip though, we both agreed that Acme had the best oyster hands down.  I took off a star for the cleanliness... it's NOLA, so it's so be expected but...",
Ac6R1IQkV7w74yC1q41HNA,,,"First time to New Orleans and Oceana Grill was the first place we tried and we were not disappointed. EVERYTHING on the menu looks delicious so it's hard to decide, our waitresses name was Whitney and she was extremely helpful with not only the service but also her recommendation on what to order and how to order it !! 5 stars not only for the food but also the amazing staff and atmosphere they provided"
AcBRMPQOOzVCRnony0XC-Q,Amazing chicken. Love the fresh squeezed lemonade and free refills plus they had great service. I just wish they had more sides without pork.,,
AcT3jC-l2En7zoVXbFGKJg,"Order the small white and a tender with the Mac and cheese, I  also got the potato salad. The food was made to go. I drove from Nashville to Chicago. I'm glad I locked it in the trunk because the smell was amazing! The food was amazing and heating the chicken in the oven brings out all the flavor. I'd drive back and do it all again just for the chicken.",,

I reccomended this place for any tourist looking to get some good seafood. 

Make sure you order the bread pudding!!!!",
AdDU0TbMYhVC_K8_WvqEag,,,My wife and I stayed at Hotel St. Pierre and we came here because they had worked out a discount with the hotel. The food was great and our service was impressive.  We both had omelettes on a Sunday morning and were excited to find another New Orleans breakfast spot! The bloody mary's were awesome and the Saints fans were entertaining!  If you're looking for a great omelette and bloody mary you may want to give this place a go!

good food
good service
 great place for the grandkids",
Adq8M8-or37nmjCep-H2DA,,,"Food was good, we ordered a couple poboys, and I ordered the blackened catfish with mustard greens and jambalaya rice. My dinner mates liked their sandwiches and whiskey Sazeracs, but my fish was a little on the thin side. But the thing that really burned us was that their credit card system was down. One person was willing to pay with his card, but we had to pay cash. Their suggestion when we said we didn't all have cash? Go to the ATM. So go find am ATM, pay the withdrawal fee, and we won't offer a discount."
Ae1Vn7-eAStBmAzptDxkPQ,"6 levels of heat (from southern= no spice to shut the cluck up= mouth on ). 2 breasts + 2 sides or 3 good sized chicken tenders + 2 sides makes for a pretty hefty meal (average female not a big guy). Sides: good pimento Mac n cheese, nothing special seasoned crinkle cut fries, & good slaw. Fresh squeezed lemonade & sweet or unsweetened tea. Line to the end of their outdoor seating took 22 minutes to reach the counter. $20 for my trucker hat & $20 for husband's t-shirt. 

Head to Gigi's after for a triple chocolate cupcake for dessert to seal the deal!",,
AeNtoUjo3LBSWg8D1Rpvmw,,,"If you're in the area, go to the Oceana Grill for good food for a decent price. Shell oysters were good, but could do with more - something. Po boys were very good. Service was great. Atmosphere was rowdy though; made us feel like we were in a bar and not a restaurant."
AeSmUK-WIs02lW0IEIGwWw,Super excellent chicken and love the level of spice. I like relatively hot things but didn't feel like being in pain today so I got the Medium level heat. Definitely still had some heat and was perfect for me. The pimento Mac and cheese was also great. Obviously this type of food is gonna be pretty heavy and I took a nap after,,
AeV4cjjoSiGcpWOCSuVkug,,Had the sausage po boy. Was good. My wife had the seafood gumbo. Was not very good. Had like 3 little pieces of seafood in it.,
Af6F1VRATSBiYp7s_QakEg,,,"I loved everything about my experience at Oceana! The service is great and the food was excellent!  I had the salmon burger and jambalaya with a hurricane and my husband had the alligator sausage Po boy and fried egg plant. We shared the bread pudding for dessert. It was all DELICIOUS  and I'm still dreaming about that bread pudding. I highly recommend this restaurant  for anyone looking for good authentic food, great drinks and great service. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in NOLA."
Af_kB4bhol1QZBzMmYoRwQ,"Does it live up to the hype? Not sure! I can't be mad though because we barely waited in line. Went with my husband and daughters, and we waited maybe 10 min in line and found a table right away. We didn't wait long for our food either. I recommend going for an early dinner to avoid the long wait- we went at around 5 since we had gone out for a late breakfast and had skipped lunch. We ordered the small dark mild and medium. For sides we had the Mac and cheese (which was really good), fries (crispy and delicious), coleslaw (didn't like it - funny taste I couldn't make out), and baked beans (pretty good). The mild chicken had the right amount of kick for me. The medium wasn't too hot according to my husband and daughters. The flavor and quality of the chicken was good, but I wasn't wowed. I think I'm okay with not going back. Glad I gave it a try though as it's a staple of Nashville, and I think anyone visiting should, too. If I had waited an hour or longer I would definitely agree with other reviewers that it's not worth it.",,
Afe5k734zKCGqzWSf131bw,,,"The service here was good but the food is kind of an afterthought, small kitchen just trying to crank out as much as they can. My fish was very over cooked and the jambalaya was bland and mushy. Their oysters were fresh and clean and the beer was cold so that's a plus!"
AfeS2ROwdveygY3jkdF2zA,,,"We loved it so much that we returned! Like spicy? Then enjoy the Cajun Crawfish Scones Delight. Also, try the Pain Perdu (French toast) to ease your sweet tooth after a long night in the French Quarter. Continuing the party during breakfast? The Bahama Mama is probably the best cocktail available in NOLA. 
Restrooms are super clean and Angela, our server, was top notch!

TIP: Just hold your nose on your way to and from so you don't ""lose your lunch"""
Afgb8FbNDO2GGXU7CRKRoA,,This place was great. Everyone was so friendly. One of the guys told me he handles about 900 oysters a day and they are busy from start to finish. It was awesome. The fried fish po boy was great.,
Afo1vqbb1OUFHzqI6ikH6A,,,"The service and food was awesome!!! I especially loved the seafood gumbo was my favorite!!! The red beans and rice, Cajun pasta with alligator sausage, and mustard greens all delicious. Our waiter David was extremely nice and knowledgeable of all the entrees."

Ag38-dsYrMu0vNU-5regYQ,,"I don't know if this place is worth the hype. Yes, the oysters were outstanding. But the place was dark and filthy and the rest of the food we ordered (po boys and gumbo) were mediocre at best.  My roast beef po boy came and there was gravy slopped all over and under the plate.  It was good for a one time visit for the oysters. Wouldn't run to go back.",
AgAXgBfSVz7ze9jysOxkVQ,,,Loved this place. The service was amazing!!! The charbroiled oysters were delicious!!! All the food was great. Good cocktails. Will be coming back
AgJxCwwC90WwUOv7g3tiXQ,,"During our stay in NOLA, we only got to try Chargrilled Oysters at Acme Oyster House so I can't really compare it to anything else since I've never had Chargrilled Oysters before until now. 

This place is super packed and there is a line out the door as soon as it opens.  We arrived at 10:45am (this place opens at 11am) on a Saturday morning and there was already a line and we still had to wait.  We weren't really seated until closer to 11:15am.  Just to warn you know, it can be a bit chaotic when lining up.  They only seat you if your entire party is there.  Otherwise, you have to wait in line and they will skip you and seat other people who are there with their entire parties.  It can get crazy when there are huge groups of bachelor parties in front of you.  On top of that, there is no setup for a line.  There were some arguments that broke out and people were upset thinking that they were in line the whole time.  Just be ready for a mess! 

Once seated, they are pretty quick at taking your order and serving you.  We ordered the three dozen Chargrilled Oysters split between six people.  They come smoking hot to your table and bubbly with the melted cheese.  They can be very rich but they are definitely different and different meaning good.  

We also ordered three dozen raw oysters to split as well.  They serve Gulf Oysters which are thick and large.  I'm more used to the smaller varietals and felt that it was a bit too much for me.  I'm still a novice oyster eater but everyone else at the table loved them.  

We also got a soft shell crab platter and fried oyster platter.  By far, our favorite dish was the Fried Oysters.  Those were really really good.  Deep fried, juicy and tasty!  The soft shell crab platter was also another great dish with deep fried soft shell crab, not like the Japanese type of soft shell crab.  This was hearty and big and yummy! 

The gumbo and jambalaya were meh.  

Overall, we were in and out within an hour.  Is it worth the wait?  I'd have to say YES if you haven't tried Chargrilled Oysters.  But it's really more worth the wait for their other dishes which are just as good.",
AgODs-aJK7T9DNJq8cZJ1A,,"The wait is a pain, but the food is delicious. The oysters are perfectly cooked (didn't try them raw, don't want to), and the crab cakes were fresh. Only issue is that you cannot split checks. I understand not splitting the oyster orders, but when everyone gets separate plates of food there should be a way to get separate checks. Other than that, great atmosphere and staff.",
AgU71lgnkoIIfK0KZ0C0lg,"I LOVED this place and I think it is worth all the hype!  The chicken is so good!  We went on a Sunday afternoon so we can get the chicken and waffle dish (which is only served on Sunday).  We went around 3pm...the crowd wasn't too bad..it was actually one of the shortest lines we stood in while in Nashville.  I would definitely recommend it...I almost wish we had enough time to do it again before we left.

You get a decent amount of food and it's reasonably priced!  It's also a nice atmosphere to sit outside and watch the football games or talk to some of the people you end up sharing a picnic table with.  It's very low key and a great place to eat! 

Definitely come here, you will not regret it!",,

And the sweet tea tastes just like we drink in the south! Delicious!!! This is a must on our list when we visit Nashville again!",,

AiMoQZgU8hw2dYAyp4vqvg,,"There never seems to be a shortage of restaurants that rely on quantity over quality.  Acme is no exception.  Just three weeks ago, my wife and I drove to Boston to eat at the Neptune Oyster Bar.  We savored the delicate flavors of the kumamotoes, the kushi's, maine and cap cod oysters.  Some reminded us of the sea, the kushi of cucumbers.  Heading to NOLA, we were excited to sample LA oysters for the first time.  Oh, what a disappointment.  

We asked to be seated at the bar so we could see the oysters shucked.  We immediately noticed that the oysters, and the bin the oysters are held, are covered with Lousiana mud.  The shucker's hand, and shucking tool, also were completely covered in mud.  After opening each oyster, he'd use the muddy tool to separate the oyster from its shell.  

Lousiana oysters are big compared to oysters from the pacific northwest and the northeast, as other yelpers have pointed out, and not terribly expensive.  But as we were disappointed to discover, LA oysters are also rather tasteless.  Quite frankly, the only 'flavor' I could taste was the gravelly mud that was smeared on the oyster, from forementioned muddy tool.  They just weren't good.  Expecially in contrast with our experience in Boston where the oysters actually had subtle flavors of sweetness, saltiness, and so on.  Sadly, another case of quantity over quality.  Not surprising for an establishment that hangs a sign with names of patrons that can dozens of oysters over a short period of time.   I suppose I'm not the right target customer.  The Acme customer is the guy who recently yelped that he could ""throw down oysters"" and had ""36 oysters in like 5 minutes"".  

We also tried the fried oysters and the char-grilled oysters.  Fried oysters weren't bad, but it wasn't because of the oysters.  It was the fried dough that was good.  The char-grilled oysters were alright, but again, nothing special.  

Acme was strike #2 for our NOLA dining experience.  See my comments on Commander's Palace for strike #1.",
AiT5sd4lS9gP6Hyn4w3U_Q,,"Great recommendation from our UBER driver. Must try charbroiled oysters, deep fried crab platter, red beans and rice. You can't go wrong with trying them. The place is not fine dinning, but a great place to hang out at the bar and usually a line out the door.",Great crab cakes and must have a po boy too! Service was fast and friendly. UBER driver recommended this place and glad we came here instead of another place.
AihjjVmWIghfw2eSfxv85A,,,"I've been to Oceana twice, and both times the food was excellent.  However, the first time our service was awful.., like, deplorably terrible and I swore I would never go back.  However, a friend raved about it and finally offered to buy dinner if I would give it another shot.  Not one to turn down a free meal, I agreed... and had a great experience!  Again, the food was amazing, and one the second go-round, the service was fantastic!  They have a great menu, an amazing cocktails menu, and they make the best Sazerac in the Quarter.  Because it's on Bourbon Street and little pricey, I'm a bit gun-shy about going back on my own dime, just because when I spend upwards of $70-$80 on a meal for two, I appreciate a server who is polite and maybe even a bit friendly, and I've found the service there to be inconsistent.  But again, food was great on both trips."

AjXZCmAMx5-c98MEpLUMog,,,Can I just say this is my most favorite restaurant in New Orleans. The staff is so friendly and sweet. Damon was our waiter and he's excellent. The drinks are spot on. The redfish and pasta were just mouthwatering. I can't say enough about the taste. We have tried so many restaurants and it's really hard to pick a favorite when the food is so good all around. But this Hass to be it. Don't mess Oceana grill if you're in French Quarter.
AjrLTXeOy8cuNTMA-KTZwA,,,"Nice restaurant, good stuff. I would recommend crab cake and crawfish etoufee(served all year round)."
AjzxC-vjHNL92sTWybVYHg,,"We got an order of the raw and chargrilled oysters. The raw oysters were very fresh and the chargrilled oysters were delicious! We also ordered the boom boom shrimp which were good in flavor but cold. Seems like they would have tasted better warm at least. I ordered a cup of the Chicken/Andouille Gumbo which was delicious as well. Last but not least we ordered the new orleans medley (Sampling of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice and grilled smoked sausage). We decided to get the seafood gumbo since I had already ordered the chicken/andouille. It was ok but i would definatly order the Chicken/Andouille gumbo over the fishy seafood gumbo. The Jambalaya was good buy i still like Felix's jambalaya better. 

The seating seemed a bit unorganized. They sat us at a table where another couple was already sitting at and they had ordered their food as well. The couple came back from the bathroom and got mad at us for sitting there. We tried to explain that we were sat there by the hostess. Needless to say they moved to a different table and the waitresses involved didn't seem one bit surprised. I guess it happens a lot? Anyways I could see the guy complaining to everyone around him about us and he kept pointing at us the entire time. Kinda annoying but people are weird. Just made the visit a little uncomfortable due to the fact that the waitresses didn't seems to care about the mix up.",
AkBtT43dYcttxQ3qOzPBAg,,"""Stormin Norman"" keepin' it real at the bar.
Talk about oyster shuckin' madness.
This place is probably one of the most talked about places to eat oysters while in New Orleans, but apparently, people should be talking about Stormin Norman who is world famous for his oyster shucking skills.

The line was down the block , but lucky for me, a party of one or two can scoot right up to the front of the line if willing to sit at the oyster bar. I don't like to wait in line, so I would have sat on the curb to eat oysters that day.

So fresh and so good!

It's packed inside, and loud, but the energy is that of New York or any city where time is money and people love your food.

2 words...Do IT!!","Oysters oysters oysters!
The interior resembles a Bubba Gumps or other chain, but we sat at the bar and simply enjoyed the food despite the average ambiance.
We tried 3 different types of oysters here. Fried oysters, oysters on the half shell and baked oysters that were so frickin delicious, we could have eaten 3 more dozen.
I would absolutely go back again and again to get my oyster fix.
The bartender was a treat as well. Informative and a great mixologist - she made our experience even better."

If seafood doesn't do it for you, I recommend their gator po' boy or anything from their BBQ.  Great service and desserts, as well. The ONLY downside is the slighlty crammed seating, but is not bad at all if you visit during their less busy hours.  I'd give this place six stars if I could."
Anam0Ck1ZsFrA6FhVP-JEg,,,"Epic little place that we found while meandering the streets of the French Quarter. Have walked by dozens of times but never even noticed the place! Somewhat hidden and unassuming venue off of Bourbon street on Conti St.

There is a really large area upstairs that can accommodate larger groups, which is near where we were seated. Downstairs has a few tables and a decent sized bar area.

I started off with a bang via double Absolute and Red Bull. Yippee-Yi-Yo-Ti-Yay!!! Great start and at $14.50 for a double, fairly reasonable. Next came the BBQ peel and eat Shrimp appetizer for $8.00. Another great deal considering the size and amount of shrimp, as well as the overall flavor. Saturated in a tangy, savory sauce, they were everything I expected and more, (including the mess). I typically am not a big fan of peel and eat shrimp, (mainly because of the messiness), but these were well worth the effort. Served up with a couple slices of soft, fresh and warm sourdough bread. Perfect for dipping into the leftover BBQ sauce!!!

Followed that up with a ""Taste of New Orleans"" entrée, priced at $16.00 Excellent value there... The etouffee' was killer good, jambalaya was deliciously piquant, sausage appropriately spicey, (it really brought the taste buds to life), and the red beans / rice were out of this world.

Service, while a tad on the slow side, was extremely hospitable. The tempo of the service didn't really bother us though, as we were in no real hurry to leave. Definitely worth a repeat visit when I go back in May!!!"
AnbvqiiOGhg_0XSQfreLnA,,,"I'm really disappointed in myself for coming here. Despite the great reviews, this place is just like any other chain restaurant. I was fooled by great rating into coming here.

Let's back track a little - the service was great, I'll give them that much. But the quality of the food and the atmosphere was very much like an Applebees or Red Lobster. I also only had a long weekend in NOLA and wanted to immerse myself in the culture and authentic food and this was not it. If you're like me, I would not recommend this. 

There are so many places with great quality food in the area."
AnfsOXXkRQuMCL8eYP5YZQ,,Went to the one in Harrahs and the line was ridiculously long around 3:30pm. The food was ok. I was really looking forward to the charbroiled oysters but they didn't have it at that location. The seafood gumbo was good and the seafood poboy was mediocre. It didn't have the infused Tabasco in the mayo like the description has said. And if you ask for anything else you have to wait in line again.,
AniKUwEfQ_EkkZ8hfAbl9w,,"Boo fries! I thought they sounded gross...they do sound gross! However, they are DELICIOUS!!

I hate oysters...the chargrilled tasted so great and not fishy at all, truly delectable. Great Moscow mules in copper cups. I had the crab cake and coleslaw BOMB. I just wish they dressed up the crab cake with something, but flavor was great.",
AnmnLjGURagnzk9PukE-ZQ,"This place rocks! Sure, it's the equivalent of going to Tony Luke's for a cheesesteak in Philly, but that doesn't mean you won't love your meal.
I stopped by this afternoon and the place was jumping. Tip, use the south door entrance so you are coming into the line to order, whether it's take out or dining in. Large menu right in front of you, so it only takes a minute to figure out what you want. Canned macro beers, numerous local draft options and soda, sweet tea self serve just past the counter. Staff super efficient, busy and so friendly even with the rush. Very impressed. 
I decided on a chicken sandwich (Damn Hot! level) and it was very hot. I was very impressed. I ordered a $2 chicken tender of Shut the Cluck Up and it is pretty evil. Side of collard greens and I was a very satisfied customer. Take out and it was ready in 10 minutes. They are so on top of their orders, it's ridiculous. What a gem.",,
AnwhuHXSh2KwetXKv5OPKA,"The chicken was good, it was spicy (and I got the mild) but it had a good taste to it.  It was nice and moist inside with a crunchy & spicy breading on the outside.

AoDVtc6jI0MK60-yk91mSw,,"Acme Oyster House was phenomenal. Where do i begin?! Order the charbroiled oysters, a surreal ectasy of flavor displaying new orleans talent in food. We ordered red beans and jambalaya as well, really owned the night.  Their bloody marys are worth your money too",
AobI_RvAQskLRLdm1PjGTw,"This place is amazing! One of the best fried chicken I have ever had! There are different levels of spiciness that you can choose from, but I was only able to go as far as medium. The mild has a nice kick to it, but the medium had a nicer spice. The sides are amazing such as the fries, coleslaw, and mac and cheese. Even their banana pudding was delicious and a nice way to cool the tongue after eating all the hot chicken. My boyfriend tried the spiciest level, which is ""shut the cluck up"", and he was dying. He's usually a pro when it comes to spicy food, but after one small bite, his tongue started to burn and sweated profusely. This place does not fool around when it comes to their hotness and spiciness. But I would definitely recommend this place! 

**Side note** There is always a long line here, so if you don't feel like waiting on line, locals have suggested to order the food online and pick it up to save yourself from the long wait.",,
AogU8KsnISqDTJV19saECQ,"What a great place. Food was fresh and delicious. They even let us in a few minutes before closing and let us enjoy our food while they cleaned. I loved that the bread soaked up the goodness of the chicken. Also, super impressed by all the local beer on tap. I'd pick this place a thousand times over Loveless (I'm sure some people will send me hate comments for that). Oh well, totally worth it!",,
Aonu6ywGPKoigMcn1QR_dg,"""What the hell is hot chicken?"" is what I said when people first told me about Hattie B's. The best way I can describe it is crispy fried chicken with spicy flavors in every bite. That hardly does it justice, but just take my word that It. Is. Delicious!

Lovey and I split the 2 breasts and wings meal. It was $11 and it was enough for the two of us to share. It came with 2 sides, so we opted for the greens and baked beans. The sides complemented the chicken well, but oh, that chicken... mouthwatering and perfectly spicy.  By the way: They have varying levels of heat. We chose ""Hot"" (two guys sitting by us got the ""Damn Hot"" chicken and they were sweating profusely). I don't think I would go hotter than ""Hot"" unless I was drunk or dared by a friend.

Bottom line is: Run, don't walk, to Hattie B's! There will be a line out the door, but go anyway-it will be worth it.",,

AqME_d03oH-RKrBbkBe_QQ,,"Waited about 45 minutes in line expecting to be blown away with my food. I was very disappointed in the gumbo. It was watered down and basically like a chicken soup. Maybe I'm just used to a more Creole, ""dirty"" or heartier gumbo with okra, shrimp, oysters, crab, chicken, sausage, cajun seasoning etc.  Red beans and rice were just okay, but I didn't have any kick to it. Everything was just a little too ""vanilla"" for me.",
AqwTAjoyG5HfhQi2-ab4cw,"Now I understand fried chicken and I believe! I don't know what spices they used for the brine or batter, but whatever it is, wow, it was amazing! Granted, I had the thigh and drumstick, which is more forgiving than white meat, but that was, hands down, the best fried chicken that I've ever had. 

It actually wasn't as spicy as I expected. I had 4/5 on their hot scale and I wasn't begging for mama's milk or anything. The spice is subtle and lingers on your lips. It was just so juicy and flavorful. It didn't taste greasy and the crust was so crispy. My husband had the tenders and since there was more surface area to volume for the batter and spice mix dusting, he was sniffling and drinking big gulps of water. I tried a bite of the tenders and it was ok. Folks, go with the bone in portions and leave the boneless stuff for McD's. 

I had the pimento Mac and cheese and that stuff was legit. Full flavored goodness and simply melts in your mouth. My second side was the greens and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There was a big chunk of the ham in my cup, too. They definitely didn't skimp. I tried a bite of my husband's baked beans, also packed with bold flavors. It was on the sweet side, not sure if I would want more than a few spoonfuls with the other rich sides. 

For a sweet finish, we got the banana pudding. I found the bananas to be a bit gummy and could taste the corn starch in the vanilla pudding. I probably prefer the custard to be more thickened with egg yokes and less starch. Didn't stop me from eating half the cup, though. 

Be prepared to wait. I live in San Francisco where waiting for food is an endured pastime so the 30 minute wait from getting in line to the first bite sounds minuscule. I would wait a lot longer for the deliciousness dished up here. If I ever come back to Nashville, this is a must stop.",,

Ariwz06at3CtbWZM-gPMAg,,,"2.6 stars, no more; I have rounded it up to 3 Yelp stars, per the rules of basic arithmetic. This restaurant could have earned 4 stars, but for the obnoxious behavior of two male bartenders regarding solicitation of good Yelp reviews that I will detail later below.

This restaurant has a good menu, and particularly lots of seafood and related dishes, but it also offers a number of classic staple American foods, including hamburgers. 

Across several recent stays in the French Quarter, I have eaten dinner at this restaurant twice. Since the tables in the seating area were always filling fast (it was always at or near dinnertime on each occasion), I chose each time to sit at the bar, even though I do not drink alcohol (I know... what an anomaly for a visitor to the French Quarter!). 

The menu selection was good, the food was quite good (I ordered an appetizer and a dinner selection during each visit), and, despite the fact that the restaurant was often filling with dinner customers rapidly, the food was nonetheless delivered within a reasonable amount of time.

BTW, I have never sat, nor eaten, at a table in any of the dining rooms, and thus I cannot comment on table service. 
 
And now it is time to be really frank and blunt: The reality is that I would, under ordinary circumstances, have been tempted to give this restaurant 4 stars, but I can, in all honesty, give them only 2.6 stars at best due to certain behaviors of two male bartenders (I never had this experience with any of the female bartenders who served me) in relation to their attemtps to solicit good Yelp reviews on each of my visits; I will detail those offensive behaviors below.

During each of my two visits to this eaterie, when I sat at the bar, the bar was staffed by at least two or three bartenders, and, during the course each meal, I always received service from at least two of the bartenders, each time from one female and one male. During each of these visits, at the end of my meal, as I was reviewing my bill and paying, the male bartender (a different one each time) grabbed an oversized business card and handed it to me, telling me that it contained a link to the restaurant's Yelp review page, and asking me to leave them a good review (UGH, UGH, UGH....!). 

Each of these two male bartenders then told me their names very clearly, and told me that it would be very good if I would mention them by name (MORE UGHS!). Gratifyingly, each time that each of the offensive male bartenders mouthed these obnoxious words, I noticed the nearby female bartender in attendance (who had also served me during the course of my meal) roll her eyes to the ceiling in acute embarrassment! 

So, the bottom line is that two of the male bartenders tried WAY TOO HARD to try to get customers to leave good Yelp reviews (better never to ask for a good Yelp review at all...) for the restaurant, and were thoroughly obnoxious in trying to get me to mention their names in said review. TOTALLY OBNOXIOUS! Thankfully, neither of the two female bartenders with whom I interacted during my two meals at the bar ever tried any of these offensive shenanigans. 

So, potentially 4 stars, but degraded to 2.6 stars because some of the male bartenders try way too hard in relation to soliciting good Yelp reviews!"

There was a line outside but they kept to the 15 minute wait time that we'd been quoted. Ashleigh was GREAT!!!!! She told us about the specials, one of which was a blackened red fish with sautéed shrimp on top, a crawfish stuffing, and smoked mustard greens. The mustard greens were not cooked with pork! She made it sound so good we both decided to order it. Our food was room temperature when it arrived, but after informing Ashleigh of this when she came to check on us, she insisted on taking our food back and having them made fresh. Ashleigh provided AWESOME service and we'd definitely return the next time we're in town."

My only advice is DON'T get them with crab meat on top - it'll run you an extra $8 and you'll hardly even notice that it's there.",
AsQnKqb8jf73mLXYPM5RCw,,"The oysters were excellent, and jambalaya was very good. I was disappointed by the shrimp po boy, it was a little dry and lacked flavor. Recommend sticking with the oysters for sure!",
AsUDg2wZZqkgZzl0kuFvIA,,"Crawfish extravaganza.  That's pretty much what we did.  The crawfish were a little more expensive than I had thought they would be ($9.99 v. around $4.99), though the latter might just be the actual cost, and $9.99 what all restaurants charge?  I'm unclear on this.   

Regardless, the crawfish were wonderful.  Perfect amount of seasoning, and when you sucked the heads, all the delicious flavor came streaming out.  Excellent.  

The sides were kind of bland, and the crawfish took a little too long to come out.  We had ordered in increments to avoid over-ordering.  Overall, a wonderful meal centered around crawfish... the tab came out to be more than we expected.  I did not get to try any other restaurants in New Orleans that served crawfish, so I don't how to compare situations.  

Not a 5 star by any stretch of the imagination, but a solid 4.

P.S. We waited in line for an hour.",
AsUvXYx9ZVn3IMJmAIwhYw,,"Acme Oyster House is for tourists. And that's not always a bad thing. The constant hordes of people and long lines are enough to intrigue you to check it out. We arrived at around 5:30PM and waited in line for around 10 minutes before we were called in to eat at the bar. 

We started off with a dozen Chargrilled Oysters and also got the Seafood Étouffée. While waiting for our food, we ordered a couple of mixed drinks at the bar. Word of warning: sugar overload. Lots of sugary mixer, not a whole lot of alcohol in these drinks, which isn't a huge deal to me but perhaps not so much who actually want to get their money's worth here. Skip the drinks and get your drink on somewhere around Bourbon Street instead. 

The Seafood Étouffée arrived quickly and while the flavor was on point, the shrimp was a tad overcooked and a little chewy. I found myself eating more of the rice to sop up the savory roux sauce. The chargrilled oysters came soon after and were served alongside thick slices of bread. At first, I was confused on why we needed bread for eating oysters but that garlicky, buttery sauce went pretty nicely layered on top.",

All staff members were courteous, from Larita the hostess to our server Sinny (cute name & face to match), even the bus boy (whose is unknown).  The atomsphere was busy yet not overwhelming.  

The food was good to the taste and cost effective.

This restaurant get a ++++ in my book.",

The po boy didn't wow me per se, since I thought the bread was kinda stiff. But the shrimp itself was great and in a fairly generous portion! The jambalaya I was thought was much more well prepared,  perfectly spiced and seasoned. 

I'm a huge shrimp fan, so I had to get something shrimp, but definitely will need to try the oysters next time!",
AspX78mYHKHdBhvcLXvRIg,"If the line is about 20-25 feet out the door, you're looking at an hour at least to order. It's so worth the wait, I got the medium and hot chicken tenders and both have kick. The hot is indeed make you sweat, burn your mouth hot but it's a flavorful hot not just a knock your socks off hot. The fries have a Cajun spice on them which is good and the Cole slaw is good. The Hattie's sauce is a Cajun aioli which is really good and has a slick kick. I'm not a spicy chicken guy but the manager told me to give it a try and it's good. As far as portion sizes, I got 3 tenders and two sides and I can't finish one of the tenders and most of the sides. I have been told more than once that I can pack away the food. These tenders are big, juicy and filling!",,

My daughter and boyfriend each had a po boy they came dressed. The waitress didn't ask and we didn't specify that they wanted them undressed so be aware of that. My boyfriend got the smoked sausage po boy and said it was spicy but good. My daughter got the ham po boy and said it was exactly like you'd expect.

I had crab cakes that had a scrumptious mushroom and crawfish cream sauce.  And with it came greens and garlicky creamed potatoes. Seriously, I have eaten greens all my life and these were the best ever! Hubby had redfish topped with mushroom cream sauce and fried crawfish on top.  His also came with greens and he thought the greens were amazing too!

Aw2H2fMoVEoSdqpoV8aIOw,,"This place is so popular that we had to wait in line for 10-15min at 4:20pm!! And with so many complimenting comments & reviews, we thought highly of this dinner before we really had it. My friend and I both agreed this place is overrated.
As u might see in the pic, two of us ordered one dozen raw oyster, 1 dozen chargrilled oyster, 2 soft shell carb, and one shrimp po boy. The raw oyster came first, and it was actually super good. The best juicy oysters I have ever had. And it was so cheap. One dozen for 15 or 16 bucks. Then, as the other food came, we are getting more and more disappointed. 
I will give 6-stars for the raw oyster only. But 2 or three stars for the rest. Especially the P.O. boy. We had a great P.O. boy before in SC and was kind of expecting a similar one. Apparently, it was not as good.",

The husband got the mild tenders. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful. The service was awesome. Mike behind the counter has an amazing sense of humor. The vibe is awesome. The line was long and the weather was not warm, so waiting outside sucked. I would recommend calling in your order and just picking it up.",,

Other friends with me ordered from the menu a couple poboys and those looked good too. Overall, the oysters were worth it but beware of the extremely salty chargrilled oysters as it may be overload to some. I've also had Dragos' chargrilled oysters and they were a bit smaller, but about the same. Take what you will of this!",This restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel on prytania st. We took the trolley up and it was about a 5 minute walk from bourbon and canal. We got the crab cakes as an appetizer (it came as 2) for $15? Those were definitely worth it. Also got the blacked catfish poboy and alligator sausage poboy. The remoulade sauce is to die for. Our waiter was a little spacey and seemed to forget about us for a bit. We sat upstairs; the atmosphere seems like a sports bar but with cool decorations. Four stars because the service could've been better. Overall it was a great first meal in NOLA!
AwGP1zmqNZVnRmYFliCq6Q,"Hattie B's is a Nashville staple and I'm so glad we made it here before leaving town!

That being said, I do think they've got some serious room for improvement and there are some things you should KNOW!

1. Don't expect to find a parking spot nearby. You'll most likely have to pay to park in the lot behind the building. 

2. Don't arrive too hungry! We went on a Tuesday at 9pm and STILL had to wait in a long line...out in the cold...for nearly an hour! A couple of groups that were waiting with us ended up quitting, but no sir, I wasn't going to miss out on my last chance at Hot Chicken. 

3. Eat it at home! While I applaud the kitchen at being able to pump out a monstrous amount of orders in a short time, its dining area is so small it'll leave you standing around staring at other people as they devour their chicken until you're able to snatch up a picnic table for yourself. The whole thing is a little barbaric for my taste, especially when someone ""cut us in line"" and stole seats that were deservedly ours. 

4. Order a bucket of pickles because they really compliment the chicken well.

The chicken was good but at the end of the day it's just fried chicken with extra flavor. Unless you're a fried chicken connoisseur, which I understand many, many people are, I'd pop in when they're not so busy to save yourself the trouble. 

I consider myself a mac-n-cheese fanatic and Hattie B's left me perplexed at their lack of skill in making this soul-food staple. It was flavorful but watery and had the consistency of mac-n-SOUP. There's something to be said about a hearty, cheesy bowl of the good stuff. *sigh*

Finally, my poor boyfriend has a dairy allergy and was forced to order his chicken ""naked"" (without breading). As you can imagine, the experience was not so great for him. They charged us less for it, but it came out late and a little raw. Whoops! 

Despite everything, I'd highly recommend others visit this Nashville specialty. Try it for yourself!",,
Awj031P0Gxa1uh3EWiTC5Q,"On a recent visit to Nashville my wife's one request was to go to Hattie B's. I was a little taken aback by the wait, but OMG!! So worth the wait!!

AxSRSwJi7XdamZwLU6QuEQ,"Considering the hype and the long line outside - more bc there's no space inside than anything else - the chicken was just ok. Nothing mind blowing. But I guess someone said this is a must-do when visiting Nashville and it stuck. Having lived in the area for three years now, I much prefer Party Fowl chicken. In my opinion, it's on a different level compared to HBs. If you must have it order online and pick it up. Check it off your list if you must. Wait an hour outside in the heat if you must. But I would personally drive 5 minutes up the road for a better meal, wait time, and seating area.",,

While the food is good, there's nothing special about it, at least in comparison to other NHC joints. It's just--meh. The chicken is...okay. The ""damn hot"" is medium at best. If I wanted NHC with medium heat, I'd go to KFC. No, this is Nashville, so I want an experience that I can't get at a regular fried chicken place. The meat is also a bit dry.

Now the sides are a different story. The black eyed pea salad is worth going for alone. Don't even bother with the chicken. Just get yourself a cup of the black eyed pea salad, take it home, and eat it with some homemade fried chicken!",,

There were six of us in our party at Oceana Grill but only one thing he and I had in common, the Blackened Red Fish.  I remember it tasted a bit off but thought it might be the mix of spices.  I now understand that was wishful thinking as I reached for another half dozen squares of 2 ply Charmin.  On the brighter side my buddy and I have cut some weight over the last 24 hours and there's no place to go but up from here.  No I cannot recommend the Oceana Grill and I'd like to apologize to the guy next in line for the restroom at Enterprise."
AyVI_VJ3My6ibiIkcLQYGw,,"There was a line getting into Acme Oyster House like it was a club. The hostess was super nice and pleasant. She made the wait easier.

So, Acme Oyster House has a 15 dozen raw oyster challenge and initially, I got sick of the thought of 15 dozen oysters.. It's too many, I thought. And after I went, I got tough like I coulda woulda shoulda. I wished I had tried. If you don't finish it in the allotted time, you pay. If you do, you get your name on the wall and that 15 dozen is free.

If the challenge interests you at all--- DO IT!

Now in the restaurant, there's table seating or the oyster bar.. With a long line outside, you get what's available and we got a table. Our server pointed out a few things on the menu and that they're famous for their Chargrilled Oysters. Yeah, the Chargrilled Oysters are sooooo fantastic.

I got the seafood gumbo, and the taste of New Orleans. I was super excited to try the food since I was looking forward to some real gumbo!

I got the food, and it was. Just okay. I felt like something was missing from the food! I don't know if it was the spices. Or just the flavor in general. But something was def missing.

We did share our food, there was 5 of us. I also tried the bbq shrimp, the fried shrimp, the crawfish something and Cajun jambalaya pasta. The shrimp was spot on. The pasta was a bit on the spicy side tho.

Its not like I don't recommend the place or anything. But I guess try something else? Not sure. I wouldn't try this place again. The servers were really nice. But just the food something was off from it and it just bugged me :("

AznsQ60apcdmn4klSTpwtw,"One of my new favorite places to get hot chicken in Nashville. I will always be a Bolton's man through and through but let's face facts: Bolton's is kind of a dump. I've always said it is more of a shanty than a shack. I really truly do love it but I always have a hard time recommending someone go there for hot chicken, especially people from out of town. Enter Hattie B's which is drastically more upscale comparatively speaking than all the other hot chicken joints around town.

So, down to brass tax... how's the hot chicken? In a word: legit. By my estimations it is as good as any other hot chicken in town. Granted, some days it is hotter than others. Once I had it and I didn't think it was as hot. Other days I have had it and I thought it was a bit hotter. So, par for the course with all my other experiences around town... some days the chicken is just hotter than other days. On average, it's about the same heat as I have come to expect. The biggest draw for me is that like Bolton's chicken on a stick, Hattie's offers a boneless hot chicken in their tenders. I'm not really a guy who likes to fuss with breasts or thighs (chicken bones: ain't nobody got time for that) so this is a welcome option. 

The damn hot here would be comparable to hot at Bolton's or Princes and the 400 at 400 degrees. The hot is still up there but probably much more manageable for newbies who want something heavy on the heat but not really sure if they can handle it.  If you want to go balls out you can get the ghost pepper infused ""Shut the Cluck Up"" which isn't on the menu.  It packs a different flavor profile than the damn hot. It may not seem that much hotter on initial taste but it comes on a lot stronger than the damn hot the more of it you eat. Both the damn hot and the shut the cluck up are a mix of ghost pepper and habanero but also have some sweet brown sugar in the mix. The final product is a sweet and spicy paste-like glaze that induces fire breathing bliss. 

Hattie B's is an offshoot of Bishop's Meat & Three in Franklin which is a solid southern option well known for their sides. Rightfully so, the great sides have found their way to Hattie's as well. The pimento mac and cheese is my particular favorite but you might be better served to get something served cold. Take a tip from brother ry ry, when tears are streaming down your face and your head is about to burst into flames from capsaicin overload, the cool red potato salad is a welcome relief. 

In summary:

Legit hot chicken.
Patio.
Lots of seating
BEER!
Nicer than all other hot chicken dives.
Fantastic sides.

It's a winner.",,
AzvY0p7Wl6ketGDGSGDjjA,"What a fried chicken experience! As someone who calls herself a fried chicken connoisseur, this was an important stop for me when I visited Nashville. Hattie B's was the highlight of my trip. 

There are a few locations, midtown is likely the busiest as I was told by my Uber driver on the way there. The wait was about 45 minutes on line, and then another 15 or so for food. Waiting went by quickly, so don't let the queue deter you from fried chicken heaven!

The portions are generous and the prices are ridiculously fair. Two leg quarters and two sides cost $12. You can also buy an entire gallon bag of tea or lemonade for $4. I'm not kidding, they serve the sweet tea in a bag with a handle and spout! 

Seating is self serve, and they'll bring the food out to your table wherever you find somewhere to sit. They have a covered patio with a bunch of picnic tables. We didn't have any issues finding a place to sit.

The food itself was divine. Easily one of the best fried chickens I've had of my life. It was juicy and moist inside, and crunch on the outside. The seasoning and flavors on the skin and meat were so good. We ordered the mild and the medium. The spice on the medium is perfect. It's enough to burn, but not make you regret it. 

We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese, and it was equally satisfying. The chicken and the sides made a great leftover the day after too.

TLDR; Perfect meal of perfect fried chicken.",,

B-zQIv-POBeV7Q23vLF5DA,,,"This place was one of the most highly recommended places in New Orleans. This was only my first food stop when I was there, & I was extremely overwhelmed with joy. Everything was so good especially the famous oysters. I also had the redfish special which was decent, but had a taste of a friend's redfish etouffee which was even better so I would get that instead next time. The blackened alligator bite was an amazing snack as well. The jambalaya was just okay to me, it had a ""spaghetti-y"" flavor which I wasn't expecting (not sure what authentic jambalaya is supposed to taste like but I didn't care for it here), & both the shrimp & chicken gumbo was really good here when Louisiana hot sauce was added.

Came back here another time & had crawfish  Cajun fries, SO good. Also, shared both Jambalaya pasta as well as the chicken Alfredo. Both pastas needed more seasoning for sure. I wouldn't come back for the pasta next time.

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because after trying other places, I realized there were better chargrilled oysters & jambalaya elsewhere (refer to ACME on yelp & to my Coterie review). I definitely think this place is just a popular touristy restaurant & would suggest you look into other restaurants for specific dishes that its known for. However, if it's your first time in NO like it was mine, going here to experience it at least once wouldn't be a bad choice. I still feel like you'd leave here with a happy tummy like I did. As for coming back, I would stick with the famous oysters, gumbo, Cajun fries &/or blackened alligator next time."

I got a beer, a roast beef po-boy (the Acme ""10 Napkin Roast Beef""), and some hush puppies and watched lots of Louisiana oysters being shucked while I chatted with an interesting Neuropsychologist attending the same conference.  The roast beef po-boy was sloppy and delicious.  The meat was amazingly tender and I wasn't at all ashamed to lick my fingers (I was conserving napkins).  The hush puppies weren't the best I have ever had, but with the po-boy, I really didn't need any sides.  If there weren't so many other amazing restaurant choices in New Orleans, I definitely would have come back.",
B2IzOeCukIlBJ0_dh77sWQ,,"The best char grilled oysters I've ever had, worth waiting in the never ending queue. If you want to skip the queue be there for brunch, they start serving them oysters early :-)",
B2dkEemBiycenM0fjY7bKA,"Came here for the hot chicken and the line was SO LONG.  We waited about 45 minutes out in the heat.

The chicken was pretty good - we both opted for the damn hot and it definitely packed some heat.  It wasn't crazy though and we were able to finish our entire entrees fine with a little help with the mac and cheese.

But honestly the chicken was probably the only good part of it.  The sides were meh.  We both go the mac and cheese and the potato salad.  I have had much better in other areas.  So was a little disappointed in these classic southern sides.

I don't think the line was worth the chicken TBH.  It was good but not amazing.",,
B2jGwh6yI7XJwJHRjKjSKA,,,I went in with a group of people. Desireé was our server. She was so amazing! The food was great! Tried gator!! Great place to hang out and have a dinner. Thank you again Desireé for taking care of us! (Edgar and Jessica). The gays.
B3B6GYIECcZUtKplDjw8BA,,"The fried oysters and shrimp were good but not great. Same for the seafood gumbo and jambalaya. It was very busy when we went and we sat at the bar, probably not the best idea since the bartender was extremely busy. I think if I go again, I'd sit at the raw bar which looked really good but you can't eat everything.",
B3E-Aw11UXog-70N753YJw,,Not worth the long lines nor the hype. Perhaps when they are busy the quality of the food suffers.,
B3I2gWtcgqOW4gW4KGQurw,,"ACME ACME ACME... I don't even know where to begin, so before I do, I just want to say that I went there twice within the 4 days I was in New Orleans because it was so amazing!!  

It was my first time in New Orleans and I was looking forward to try some authentic southern food.  I am not a big fan of touristy places and I was worried when my friend and I were lining up that it would be one of those over-rated touristy spot in the French Quarters.  However, once I was inside the restaurant I knew my night was going to be more than fine.  First, my friend and I were welcomed by extremely friendly staff and the smell of delicious southern cuisines immediately after we stepped in. My friend and I chose to sit at the bar where we can admire the ""oyster bartenders"" clean and crack open the delicious gulf oysters.  Although the menu at the bar is a bit smaller than the regular ones, I think the view totally make up for the view missing choices.

Between the two visit we made, we had the following dishes:

Fresh, Ice Cold Oysters on the Halfshell
Fried Crab Claws
Crawfish Etouffee
New Orleans Medley--Sampling of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice and grilled smoked sausage
(We repeated some stuff second time we went so it didn't seem like much)

I have to say, all the food was amazing.  The oysters were fresh and sweet, and the homemade sauce that came with it was a total wow.  The fried crab claws basket came in a very generous portion, much much more than I ever expected to be honest and they were so tasty I couldn't stop putting them in my mouth one after another.  I was quite pleasantly surprised with the quality of the fried claws because I typically don't like food too greasy, but these crab claws were fried perfectly.  The crawfish etouffee was full of flavor and loaded with lump crawfish tail.  And the sampler was definitely a must order.  I especially loved the jambalaya and the grilled sausages.  To be honest, I have yet to be able to get them out of my mind ever since.  I wish they open up a ACME in Boston!!

One suggestion I have is to definitely try the char-grilled oysters--they looked, smelled, and (according to every customer) tasted divine.",
B3MarhSRSLKcy8j3sf85TQ,"The Call of the Cluck echoes deep from within the soul of the ancient voodoo jungle. Will you answer that call? I hope so. Shut The Cluck Up and really Hattie B's in general is just so special. Name one other place in town that makes spicy fried chicken this good? I dare you. Honestly I bet you in a few years this town will become known for this dish. I feel like this is one of the few true regional cuisines left. I also don't know where they get such mature and thoughtful birds from. Every single chicken I have eaten at Hattie B's has had the forethought and consideration to make sure it would spend its whole life preparing to make me and my mouth the happiest man in the world. What amazing fowl you guys. Honestly. Name one other place in town where the birds literally give their lives for flavor. Dedication and teamwork like this is going to take Hattie B's really far in this world and I'm going to be right there for the whole thing. Why? Because hot chicken is the best food ever, and Hattie B's has the best hot chicken ever. Wings down. The breast in the biz.",,
B3Nal_KDaJkhcsa7ZxDzqQ,"We waited in line for like....a really long time, but the line moved quickly and we had great conversation with the people around us. The restaurant itself is quite small, and most people were grabbing to-go orders. My husband got the next to hottest chicken and he teared up during eating. I - and DO NOT JUDGE ME - was not hungry, so I just got their banana pudding because who doesn't love dessert? There was approximately fourteen cups of sugar in my one cup of banana pudding, but I am not mad at all. It was delicious! The layout of the restaurant is the only thing I'm knocking a star for. Getting drinks was difficult because 1) the drink machine was behind a table of people 2) the large amount of people in the small space were all trying to get a drink. I'd definitely order hot chicken the next time I was there, because the bite I had of my husband's was fantastic!",,
B3_7wesLdWxEH07WrXNaKw,"Hattie B's is one of my go-to spots when I'm looking for a bite in Midtown (it helps that I can walk to it from my house). I've been impressed with the consistency and quality of the food and always recommend it to out of town visitors looking to eat like locals. 

For spice novices, there is the Southern chicken, which is not spicy at all, and for the more adventurous among us there is Shut the Cluck Up. I have a very high spice tolerance and for every day consumption, (if I want something that is easy to eat but still has a kick) I get the Hot, although I'm considering upgrading to Damn Hot. My boyfriend who has an above average spice tolerance does medium. If you are unsure about your spice tolerance, I highly recommend underestimating yourself. 

The sides are all good, nothing particularly notable, but enjoyable (my favorite part of the meal is just eating the white bread they put under the chicken to soak up the delicious juices). If you want something to cool your palate in between spicy bites, get cole slaw or the bean salad. The mac n cheese has pimentos in it so it's not recommended for that purpose. 

Super excited for the West Nashville location!",,

I thought ""oh great, we'll be waiting a few hours"" - but within 15 minutes we were inside, seated, checking out the menu. My partner had the Shrimp Fetuccine Alfredo, I had the ""Taste of New Orleans"" with Jambalaya, Crawfish Etouffee, and Red Beans and Rice. Our waiter, Mike P, kept checking on us. Food was served rapidly and correctly. After the main course I had the Creme Brulee; it was incredibly good. The prices were very reasonable, the atmosphere was dark but very relaxing.

The Uber dropped us off outside and we immediately noticed the long line. The driver assured us out-of-towners that the line moved quickly. Well, we baked in the sun for the better part of an hour thinking that long line = amazing food. Plus, we were reading the menu the entire time trying to find the perfect combination of chicken and sides. By the time we got inside to order, most of eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We ordered just about everything on the menu in a variety of different spice levels. The chicken was very succulent and moist and had a great texture. The flavors of heat were really good and the sides were good, but I was expecting something mind-blowing. Maybe that's unfair. Maybe it was the line. Maybe it was the hangover. Don't get me wrong. I'd definitely go back, but I just wouldn't wait an hour again.",,

Three of us for dinner the day after Christmas.  30 minute line.  That would usually sway me across the street to Felix's, but I hadn't been to ACME yet, and did Felix for my ersters my first trip out.  So wait it was.  
We were seated in the very back room (the place is HUGE!) at a picnic table.  
Our waiter was quick to bring us drinks (Abita TurboDog for me, Amber for Companion 1, pino grigio for Companion 2.)
We started with a dozen raw oysters a dozen chargrilled.  Both were AMAZING! C1 never had an oyster before meeting C2, and is not a fan of raw animal protein in general.  (Sushi is referred to as ""bait."")  Holy Mother of WOW were the chargrilled dozen incredible!  Cheesy buttery goodness...and C1 claimed he gets more than his fair 4, since he's not into the raw ones the way C2 and I are.  We fought his claim with the threat of impaling is hand with our forks...and told him he could order another dozen if he wanted more than 1/3 of tha plate - NO WAY were C2 and I granting that concession!

For entrees, I ordered the crawfish po boy (I can't get enough!), C1 got the ACME po boy and C2 had a small etoufee.  

4 beers + 2 wines + 2 dozen ersters + 2 po boys + 1 etoufee = 3 very full and very happy diners.  Total bill under $90.00?  Best.Food.Value.EVER!",

I haven't had many shrimp po boys in my life so take that as you will. Oh! The crawfish that you can add was delicious tho. Great sauce and seasoning. Service was good and everything, just can't give a strong recommendation."
B7yQMizF8cLwiMJBAH4oMg,,Wait on saturday night was really long (1.5 hours). Food was decent. Does not live up to the hype. The oysters (raw and chargrilled) were great but the jambalaya & poboys were nothing exceptional. I would go back for the oysters but thats about it.,

B8AkerR-TSeiqwQjjb--oA,"My fiancé and I do not live in Nashville, however, when we are in town, Hattie B's is a must stop for us! The line is always wrapped around the building, with a minimum wait of at least 1 hour (depending on the time we get there). No matter what the weather may be that day or how long the line gets, we are determined and persistent to get a piece of that chicken. The chicken is always made fresh to order, so you can choose the level of spice you can handle. We both love spicy food, however, we realize if it's too spicy, then we do not enjoy it as much. We either stick to medium or hot. We are never disappointed when we come because it's always consistent; the chicken is nicely marinated in this spice sauce and quickly deep fried, making it super succulent. We always pair the chicken with their southern greens along with the fries, and of course, if there's still room for dessert then banana pudding is a must (sometimes too sweet for me). We find that it's best if you devour it here rather than taking it Togo. The dining area is a little compact, so find a seat after you order or have someone save seats for you while you place the order.",,

The Damn Hot was way too hot for me.   Not enjoyable at all.   Needless to say I avoided the Shit The Cluck Up flavored tender.   Peach cobbler and banana pudding were good deserts.

Service was amazing and environment was pretty cool right in the middle of bourbon street but food was just okay. I got the redFish with a sauce. The sauce was sooooo good, it was like a mushroomy-crawfishy cheese sauce but the fish while it was good and fresh, tasted like it had no salt what so ever. The sides were just okay. My fiancé got the seafood platter that came with fried oysters, fish, and shrimp and once again everything needed salt at the very least! The fish and the shrimp looked and tasted very fresh but the oysters had a soggy texture and were much darker in color as if they had fried them two hours before and reheated it. The cheesecake was very good and I think it said its made daily  in house."

Seriously no need to go anywhere else if you want Creole/Cajun food!! We tried other places and we keep coming back here!! Everything tastes wonderful but what seals the deal and makes this a full five stars are the servers and the atmosphere all the workers are very attentive and friendly specially the servers Ashley, Bree, C.J. and Jordan!!!

BBx-ExpX-l7dS7fGZGNRow,,,"This is a mixed review for me. I loved our waiter and the other staff that was there. The restaurant is really eye catchy and you tend to get lost looking at everything. They also have a lot of seating on several floors. 

What I didnt like was that they made us wait outside, in a line for about 30+ min, which would have been ok, except once we got inside, I noticed that they had SEVERAL tables that were empty and not reserved. When I asked about it, they just shrugged. They also had inside waiting seats, but werent allowing anyone to sit in those either. I had to take my daughter to the bathroom at one point, but it was bad because it was so hot. Hotter than it was outside. I figured it must be next to a kitchen or something, they just need a bit better ventilation or AC in there. We were sweating by the time we got out of there. 

What I hated: We came here strictly for gator tail. My husband really wanted to try it. What we got was tiny and I do mean tiny, bits of nuggets that were mostly breading. It was about 10 pieces, and 3 of them were strictly breading only. We were also charged about $10 for this tidbit of food. I asked the waiter about it and he said it was a normal serving. I also ordered their signature baked oysters on the half shell. They were bad. I couldnt eat them after the first one. They tasted like old fish and smell worse. I also mentioned this to the waiter but he said there was nothing wrong with them. We got charged another $10 for that. 

The kids meals came as described, but the kids said they tasted funny. They kinda did. They had a weird rubbery taste to them. But I also had just eaten one of the oysters, so I attributed it to that. I got the small cup of gumbo (came with hardly anything in it) and my husband got what I consider the most expensive po'boy ever. The gumbo was ok and the po'boy was ok. We never got our 3rd kids meal, and I had to point that out several times when the check came, cause they still charged us for it. We finally got that removed. We ordered the kids some shirley temples because they had been good, but we got charged $7 for EACH drink. It doesnt have alcohol in it. Its sprite/7up with Grenadine. So very friendly waiter, ok food and not so great food. There are a few other places we will probably eat at next time."

BCpIyhOyz1UzE0RyKvPnfQ,,,"Ordered the gator bites, blackened and fried, the Redfish special which was on a cornbread stuffing and greens, and a sezarac to start it all off. Now mind you this was our first meal that we had in New Orleans and was just a walk in right off of Bourbon St. C'mon, that's why everyone is here in one form or another so why not enjoy a little bit of the ambiance. Having not had that much gator being up here in the NW, we don't have any, it was nice to try some of the other foods that many have enjoyed for centuries. The gator was quite delicious, and yes it did taste a lot like chicken. 

However the Redfish, which is just a cheap cut of fish in comparison to Tuna's and Salmons, was outstanding. Well cooked, succulent and moist, this wonderful fish was laid on top of a cornbread stuffing. Just WOW. And I do love some good greens, and these were fantastic. Add to is the wonderful buttery shrimp sauce labeled heavily over the top of the fish and this was a chef special that was simply too good to pass up. Ah yes, I almost forgot about the gumbo. Yes, I ate gumbo at almost every restaurant meal that I could. It was amazing to me how many different variations, combinations of meats, and the various colors and flavors of the rue, but this had to be one of the better for the entire trip. 

Yes it's load, yes it's on the divey side, but have you looked at Bourbon St. lately?? Load, noisy, sweaty warm, hot fish and cold drinks make this one of the must stops on anybody's trip to the Big Easy."

I had just gotten in from the airport, was staying nearby and didn't feel like waiting in line for dinner, so I ordered some food to go from their website -- which was SO interactive and EASY by the way. I wasn't exactly sure where to go to pick up my food, so I asked the guy at the counter if I was in the right spot. He was super friendly and helpful, and told me my food would be ready in 15 minutes and to come see him at that time. When I returned, he made sure that my food was next in line and chatted with me while I waited. He was so incredibly welcoming!

Once ready, I grabbed my food and headed back to the hotel, where I enjoyed the deliciousness in all it's entirety. I ordered numerous sides, chicken fingers, hot chicken, desserts, the lemonade, etc. Hey, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity so I wanted to try it all! And it was all DELICIOUS. Best fried chicken I've ever had. Best honey mustard I've ever had. Best customer service. Best website. Delicious sides and one of the best cobblers!

BDiFeG6V0k3nc3RUVT7lhQ,,The best charbroiled oysters you can get! Also highly recommend the boo fries and roast beef poboy!  Amazing food! Come here any chance I get.,
BDjiEmXljD2ZHT61Iv9rrQ,,"The legendary Acme Oyster House has been around since 1910! Located right off of Bourbon Street, it doesn't get more convenient than that. Very popular so there usually a long line and wait time. I happen to come in on a weekday mid afternoon off peak time by myself and got right into a bar seat. And I've had many oysters in my time, and the ones from across the street at Felix's are amazing. But I have to admit, these were incredible! I normally don't like cheese on my oysters but I figured I should try them in their specialty way and I didn't regret it. It's not cheap, kind of expensive, but worth it. Definitely come here and check out why this place is such a legend.",
BE0mUjZkDLrv2Vw3SlXXcg,,,"get the crab cakes! although i found out i'm allergic to craw fish because of this visit, i can tell you the taste of those crab cakes were worth it!!!"
BE1gmrlfu65WFF1RwP1Z8Q,,"What a great experience!  The Acme Oyster House is a must-eat if you are visiting the New Orleans French Quarter.  We attended on Sunday afternoon and sat at the bar.  It definitely adds to the experience to watch the guys crack open the fresh oysters.  The guy behind the bar gave us a lot of good information on New Orleans and even though he was responsible for cracking hundreds of oysters, he provided great service to us.  We ordered the Chargrilled Oysters (done with butter, garlic, and parmesan cheese) and they were even better than everyone said they were.  I was a little apprehensive about oysters as it was my first time eating them.  Whether you're new to seafood and oysters or simply want some amazing flavor, you must try the chargrilled oysters.  The server told us that this is the most popular item!  We also had the seafood gumbo and jumbalaya!  What a treat!  Be prepared to wait in a line - but it's well worth it!",
BE4fE4R3TaVn8xy4sYYjbg,,"Acme Oyster House was our first food stop of the trip. We were pretty excited and wanted to beat the crowds. Luckily, it was just a short 5 minute wait in line. We got a seat at the bar and ordered a 1/2 dozen chargrilled oysters and the peacemaker po boy.  I think we got our food faster than the time we had to wait in line. 

Chargrilled oysters: They were tasty but the tiniest oysters I've ever seen. The meat was more like a tiny clam than an oyster. 

Peacemaker Po Boy: More tiny shrimp and tiny oysters. Is it me or did I just think po boys are supposed to have big juicy fried oysters and shrimp? Loved the cocktail sauce, tarter sauce & mayo but that was about it. 

Acme Oyster House is definitely not worth the wait. If there is no line, it makes for an ok lunch.",
BEYj44shZHtwPNcng9s6Fw,,,"Yum, yum, yum! I ordered this on Uber Eats and had it delivered to my hotel room. It was delicious even though it was not freshly served to me at the restaurant. The bread pudding was so good that I couldn't stop eating it! Addictive!"
BEuys0T4gW8FpMMbklU58Q,,we waited about 20 minutes to get in. very over hyped. The food was so/so. It not real worth the wait. Food portions were small for the price and the po boys bread was ok! You are better of going to felixs across the street.,
BF7t8SfZ3ac_odwtcIyhSQ,,,Food was good.  We made reservations so we did not have to wait. Service was okay. There were lots of people working. I highly suggest the oysters and Cajun fries!
BFCaC_L-ELd7QeehOfSR4w,,"I expected Acme to be pricey, but to my surprise, it was probably the cheapest dinner we had in NOLA.  I'm not a huge oyster fan, but they were less than $1/each.  My co-workers kept raving about them.

I had the ""10 napkin"" roast beef po boy, and it was pretty good (po boys range in price from $10-12). 

The only downside to the place is the service.  Most of the servers have attitudes, and if your ENTIRE part is not present, you can't be seated.",
BFCuYoBoYR78qlLDtnjFhQ,,"I'm giving this place 3 stars as the most disappointing part of my dinner was the raw oysters.  They were quite bland and flavorless.  Now, the grilled oysters did have some good flavor.  Also had a crab cake that was pretty tasty.  Be prepared to wait as there is always a long line down the street.  Which is a little hard to understand as there are plenty of other restaurants in NOLA that is rather wait for.  Not exactly sure if it's special enough for a return visit.",
BFE9khRTaq8mfR8F8pVHhw,"Stopped here during a roadtrip of the south.  The food was great (I ordered the tenders, my bf ordered the two piece).  I did find the chicken spicy, but it wasn't unmanageable.  I loved the mac and cheese.  The cobbler was a berry but had a strong lemon taste, a little too much lemon for my preference.  Although I'm sure other people would like it.

The only reason this gets four stars and not five is that the line was ridiculous. We went on a weekday (maybe Wed?) and waited 45 minutes for the food.  I mean it was good, but not worth that wait at all.  There's a lot of other places you can get fried chicken from.",,
BFNcVtM5hrHb8xZ5GRGsXA,Place was very yummy I recommend I'm from Cali and I would say it taste kind of like Popeyes,,
BFZ8bXIFZjMxu0tH3e5TxQ,,I would recommend going to the acme in metairie. Raw oysters are colder and char grilled taste better. The line isn't worth the wait. It's a little farther but worth it.,
BFz8NR6rizGPiBu22TSstg,,Worth the wait!! HIGHLY recommend the charbroiled oysters and soft shell crab! It wont break the bank and will leave you stuffed!,
BGJvwJMXSKsuLIBVoUdI-w,,Love the chargrilled oysters! Been coming here for years. The pecan cobbler with ice cream is delicious too so save room for dessert!,
BGcXVo7yPbA0lEVQrWIpvw,,"The wait was short for 2. Stopped in for a snack and tried the hush puppies - it looked kinda normal but had such a good texture and taste. Great taste for a very cheap price of $2.49! Also had a dozen of oysters... it was big and fresh. 

Only tip i have for this place is that you can not bring any outside drinks in if you have any to-go cups with ya.",
BGtuvLdpGt7m_HEz6ucCbA,"Hattie B's definitely lived up to the hype.  Not only is the fried chicken delicious, but the sides are just as tasty.  Don't let the lines dissuade you, it is well worth the wait!",,
BGv8ZIUzMnSn_S8qaDXzgw,,,excellent food..strong drinks and they were so great w my daughter who was making a royal mess!!! def going back!!
BGv_TqbVs9Pfu83iw6zIhw,,,Best chargrilled oysters in NOLA. I have been to this place 3 times and was always impressed with everything I ordered. Lines move quickly.
BGvx8LHibK47zKneQt6pPA,,"Had dinner here last night.  Luckily our friends were waiting in line and we were seated promptly.  We had oysters raw and chargrilled which were good.  My husband had the roast beef poorboy and really enjoyed it.  I had the shrimp etouffee  which was good as well but a little on the salty side.  Restaurant was super busy.  Not sure if i would queue in line for the food here, probably would go across the street to felix's if the wait was too long and get an equally if not better meal.",
BH5gZFzy2WVCKzlLHhtM3Q,,"Huge platter of raw oyster with ample lemon and the best home made sauce.  Char grilled oysters were fantastic.  Also tried the New Orleans Medley with gumbo, jambalaya and red beans/rice.  GF enjoyed its shrimp etouffee. All delicious and the service was great and attentive!  Highly recommended.  I could not eat more than 1 dozen of its fresh raw oysters... huge!  (and I'm from Seattle where I sued to eat 5 dozens in 1 hour)",
BHRw5Kj8yR6_7EjcqFkmPQ,"I would go 3.5, but can't and don't really think it deserves a 3. We're visiting TN and multiple people from here have told us to try this place, so here we are. My husband and I love hot wings (LOVE them)... So we were excited to try this chicken. We got a mix of tenders (hot, damn hot and shut the cluck up).  The hot was tasty - good flavor, the damn hot burned a little but had some flavor (although mainly cayenne) and the cluck was ridiculous. All cayenne and painful. I love spicy stuff - usually hotter the better but not a fan of the cluck. Hot was a perfect mix of spices and really tender chicken! 

The sides however were totally on point. We had the Pinto Mac and the potato salad. Both were delicious and helped kill the cluck burn haha. 

Totally worth giving it a shot but I wouldn't be a regular!",,
BHTIM-orKzyn2knDYjkMQg,Come early and eat lunch with the grandma's ... otherwise you'll be waiting forever. #WorthIt,,
BI2TQNt_LCsaOeVqn4vBYA,,Charbroiled oysters are amazing! Totally worth the wait. The line went pretty fast and the staff was nice.,
BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,"We were determined to make this one of our stops before heading back home to Las Vegas. So on our last day in Tennessee, we arrived at 10:45 am and there were already people lined up. Luckily, we were like the 8th party in line so we did not have to wait long for our food despite there being 9 of us. 

Here's the good that everyone already knows: 
1. The chicken is phenomenal! The skin is super crispy and the meat is so juicy. Just make sure you can handle your heat level so you can actually enjoy your food. 
2. The sides were tasty and fresh. My favorite were the fries since they were hot and crispy. Another favorite at our table was the mac & cheese. I didn't get to try it though because I don't like cheese. 
3. The employees were all friendly despite the amount of traffic in the restaurant. 
4. They serve beer!!! 

Like i said at the beginning of my review, there is a LONG line, so get here early. The establishment itself is a little small, so if you are claustrophobic, you're SOL. I can't wait to come back!",,
BJ3CCvFv9l8eNH_cun2C_g,,,This spot did an amazing job for brunch even though they were clearly understaffed.  One waitress for the entire second floor and she apologized for the kitchen being backed up.  That said we didn't wait that long and the food was perfect.  We had the eggs Benedict and I always split this with my husband.  The problem is I like a hard yolk and he likes a soft yolk.  At Oceana that's no problem.    The dessert crepe was huge.  I would definitely recommend this place.
BJ3WjIkH_n1XogifvZ2Q2w,,"This was our last stop in New Orleans and was seated right away. We ordered some po-boy sandwiches which were delicious,good service,good vibes and good food. Check this place out, it is awesome.",
BJ9gdT-MOI8sZIFCow4dNQ,"This is a go to I take most guests when they come to Nashville, especially for the novelty of hot chicken.

We prepared to wait, and seating is limited. You often have to linger to wait until someone gets up, but definitely worth it.",,
BJOSqiysOURYmHxl8AO0gg,,"This should be your number 1 stop in NOLA! The chargrilled oysters were amazing, buttery and salty and delicious! Great staff including the master shucker Hollywood. I would eat here every meal, if I had more time!!",
BJU9f1jFJgpQgClTdpLSdA,,,"Excellent location, excellent food.  Shrimp fettuccine was the best we have EVER tasted!  Gumbo was just as great! Waiters were friendly and very pleasant.  You MUST try this if you are ever in town."
BJkH-_iH3TdUJUXzRCg6bQ,,,One of the best meals I've ever had in New Orleans! I will forever return to this restaurant. The service was wonderful and so was the food
BJncs2NeTHX4wEFPCY7pfA,,,"Lawd Have mercy!! This was worth the entire trip to Nawlins. Our server Chris recommended the taste of New Orleans and the crab cakes. Huntey let me tell you , Best dawn crab cakes I've ever encountered in my life!! And I've had crab cakes all over the world.And as for the taste of New Orleans entree dish whew! That crawfish etoufee (forgive the misspelling ) 
Was amazing ! Thank you for a wonderful meal and experience. Chris is awesome."
BJzYtirp5E5xWvXQuvWcvQ,,"This place has the largest oysters I have ever seen. If you are one of those people that likes raw oysters but doesn't order them because they do not have enough meat, try this place. You will be amazed. Étouffée is good but not spicy enough. Every type of Abita beer that exists is on tap.",
BK0Zg93npPJ7mcqlRmdi9g,,We were refused service because we had drinks from another store.  They wanted us to finish our drinks before they would seat us.  We understood the point but they didn't even attempt to accommodate us in any manner.  We flew from another state just to eat here and we weren't even offered a seat while we finished our drink.  I will NOT return.,
BKMT9ELzuqouLI2bUT027g,,,"We went here twice during our trip to New Orleans, it was excellent both times. The service is really great, and so is the food! The crab cakes were delicious, but the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo was definitely the best I've ever had.  The drinks and desserts are also well worth the money.  I would recommend this place to anyone."
BKbh4YLw8MKcKUnXm3xnGQ,,,Wayyyyy too long of a wait for extremely sub par food. You can go right around the corner to the 424 Seafood Market and get a much better overall experience
BL0Bqy_iCgIf690ZYi1yBA,,,The food was alright. Noting I'd write home about. The oysters were over cooked. The service was great though.
BL3ZnF8PSiq3r5M_OT2QRw,,Fantastic food but quite a wait. I'd recommend getting there early if you want to get in quickly. Grilled oysters are amazing.,
BLBCPMS4XHm4fcjMMaOJHw,"I feel like I am a minority in saying that Hattie B's is just okay. The atmosphere and service? Good! The sides? great! But you don't come here for that; you come here for the hot chicken.

I generally order the chicken tenders (who has time to eat around the bones? Not this girl) with the pimento mac and cheese and potato salad. I started ordering medium heat, because you hear near-horror stories when it comes to the heat levels of certain Nashville hot chicken places. To me, the medium was mild, so I them moved up to ordering hot, which still isn't doing it for me. 

If it was called Nashville kinda-hot, but more like medium spicy chicken, this would be the place. There are many other more ""authentic"" hot chicken places in town, but Hattie B's is convenient and tourist-friendly, which must be why it's getting all the attention.",,
BLC9H7TJFRpdIU2G6oi4Ew,,,"We were told by our VIP driver they had good food.
Wasn't impressed at all. The bread from the PoBoy sandwich was the best part of the,meal.
Kevin our waiter was so/so. Our table was too close to where the bar meets up with servers putting in orders and picking up drinks...felt like we were in the way.

I can say I tried the gator bites...ehhh...okay I ate gator."
BLFsFLjHtT7W2ZrXAENktg,,Everything was tasty and hot. The best oysters we've had so far here. The gumbo was decent and the étouffée was good. We even got gator bites which were good considering. I'd come back for the oysters and hurricanes!,
BLTuekR-ag4WL59hnyvdwg,,"Fresh fresh big oysters from the gulf near by
This is a must go to place for oyster lovers!
The wait is about 30-40 min but it is worth it 
Both chargrilled & raw oysters were good but I preferred the raw ones
Soft shell crab po boy was yummy; they actually give you a whole crab in the po boy",
BLlHm1qhIq5VZJ6L8y5g3w,"What keeps with from being a 5-star review is the wait. We got there a little before dinner rush on a Saturday and already a long line had formed. Not quite worth the wait for me, but I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken. In fact I ended up getting the chicken tenders. My sides were french fries and pimento man-n-cheese. It was all delicious. Mac-n-cheese was very creamy. Good portion sizes for the price. I didn't any heat on my chicken - also not a fan of spicy food. Casual. Very friendly staff.",,
BLy4QAUjzBraRRqh_Jdy1Q,,"Love this place. Came here twice during my two day outing in NOLA. If you can, eat at the Oyster Bar. Your food comes quick and you can see how oyster shucking is done.

Highlights: Chargrilled Oysters, gumbo and bread pudding.",
BM9gzs-36i3vZak004Kedw,"Drove out to this place based on these reviews. I was happy. The fried or grilled chicken was delicious, the sides as well. Service is very friendly and helpful. Portions generous. Only wish they had more vegetarian sides or options without pork.",,
BMAjBHd04lfrlB1u9OkV7Q,,,"OMG the food is delicious, the service is A1 and our server Lavern was amazing. Attentive and fast will definitely be back."
BMBElgLAofge1MTLtbFFdA,,,Amazing specials.  Decently priced. Great location.  I'll surely be back here soon.  The staff is also very courteous.
BMME1RGvtKjEfcn_dWUE2w,Worth the wait. Awesome chicken. Good prices. Lives up to the hype. Definitely recommend going somewhere around medium on the heat scale.,,
BMYlpx_CyYDnFVj3r_owEw,,,"Very good food and excellent service.  We ate red beans and rice with crawfish, crab cakes & ribs.  The food was delicious.  Good size portions too.  We had the bread pudding and kailua chocolate mousse and they were luscious."
BMcroNDmg4jqvY-QXO8Y3A,,,This place was recommended by a local and it didn't disappoint. The crab cakes were AMAZING. The Best of New Orleans dish was really good. Great service at the bar. Would definitely recommend this place. Bartender Josh was excellent.
BMf5e5t3pZinfjD37EvMig,"Hattie B!  What's a girl to do who lives too far away for your amazing delights?

My husband and I visited for dinner on a Wednesday night, 8P or so.  Waited on line for 45 minutes and ordered the chicken tenders (mild), mac and cheese, coleslaw, cooked greens, banana pudding and lemonade.  Shared a table with 2 others...it's super casual.

Even mild is sorta spicy for us non fire-breathers and we were happy we didn't go hotter.  Absolutely fantastic.  My husband said the pimiento mac and cheese may be the best mac and cheese he has ever eaten.  I should have known...he is cuckoo for pimiento cheese.  Coleslaw and greens were good but nothing worth raving over.  Loved the banana pudding and regretted not ordering the cobbler as well.  We weren't hungry but no way we're standing in line for 45 more minutes to get a dessert I had no business ordering.

We drove past 2 other times on our trip, hoping for a shorter line but no go.  Hattie's deserves their lines and accolades. It will be one of my first stops next time I visit Nashville!",,
BMrl00awiWNP5Apa6JY9Mw,"Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had, hands down. Their batter is really crisp and full of flavor and the chicken juicy; it was cooked perfectly. It was a very hot day and I was sweating profusely, had to juggle with the paper towels they provided at the table as my hands were messy due to my barbaric eating habits, as I also had to wipe my sweat (eww) lol. It's a very compact restaurant.. could use more air circulation, but still definitely a go to spot when it comes to fried chicken-excuse me (hot chicken).",,
BMwyfDDApBgc2MDUqfZYyg,,Enjoyed a half dozen on the half shell and the New Orleans Medley for lunch while sitting at the oyster bar. Good stuff!,
BN53Mdu4W-a-QYyjtsTefA,,"This place is overhyped. They're known for their chargrilled oysters which are tasty, but not worth the long wait in line. 

The line looks daunting, but we were able to get seated in about 30 minutes around 4pm on a Saturday. We ordered raw oysters, chargrilled oysters, and fries. The raw oysters were decently fresh. The chargrilled oysters were pretty good, but you could only taste the butter and cheese they were drenched in.

I think it's good to experience this NOLA attraction once, but I wouldn't come here again due to the crowd.",
BNDYVzSxEsHGSpjE5bZV9w,"The chicken is worth the hype, I had the 1/2 bird seasoned hot with baked beans and fries. Really good. Even though there was line for 30 min outside the building in the 33 degree weather, It was worth the wait. It is a bus stop on the old town trolley as well.",,
BNDcTjgpGRHwMtw1-Kn9ig,,,"This place is amazing. From the time we walked in until we left, every single staff members had a smile on their face and was completely attentive to our needs. The food was on a whole notha' level. The portions are huge, the taste is amazing, and everything is super fresh. I can't wait to be back for another meal."
BNH8bG7Ha7tzpdUlzLC9mQ,,,I went there last year and had good experience but this year it didn't meet the expectations and the shrimp tasted like some regular restaurant in Memphis. Their crabmeat cake is good tho. I liked Cadillac margarita and my girlfriend had tropical storm which is good too .hmm
BNgrMVtJnxcXjiE0G09HCw,"""Locals"" will say this isn't the best chicken in town because it is the most chain like but the reality is it is the cleanest, best run and flat out best chicken!",,
BO-1r5r3I7q9LfL74dndEQ,,"I got to walk right in to the front of the line because I was a party of one and took a seat at the bar which was a fabulous place to sit. Then the host recommended the chargrilled oysters and I took him up on it and wasn't disappointed. They came dripping in butter with bread to soak it up and it was amazing. I did order a cup of seafood gumbo afterward which was good, but super small for that price. So then I ordered the crab cake appetizer which was bigger than I thought it would be but not that great. However, still a 5star experience.",
BONe-zCtwoBoGo1BwNPp3g,"Was it worth the hour or so I spent in line catching up with a friend in Nashville? Yes it was! 

I went medium hot but I'd go for hot hot next time I think I can handle it. 

Greens, Mac and Cheese and holy ridiculousness the banana pudding.",,
BOXmNc9VykHjj4bYZ4z2hQ,"So much hype and more than hour waits.  Why?
It was ok but the Damn Hot was good but not a standout amongst so many other great chicken spots in America.   Definitely had a yummy moistness to it. 

As for the hottest - really hot and a thick oily goo.  Too Dangerous for me but the guys enjoyed the adventure it brought.  

Sides - they were alright.  Superb Mac n cheese.  Baked beans - differently tasty.  Green - fair.  

Staff - superior service with smiles and friendliness.  

Overall not worth the wait or long drive.  If local and ordering online - sure would!",,
BOuJGJsYqsnixINwaGm82w,,"I don't know what places the other reviewers are at, but from someone who knows food, this place was janky and not very good. We sent back the gumbo. The fried shrimp and crawfish were frozen I'm pretty sure, if they were fresh, they were on the lower end of the quality scale. The grilled oysters were OK and is the only thing I can recommend, but they are soaked in so much unflavored oil and grease, that it's tough to get through 12 by yourself. Not really sure how clean it is (guessing not very by the look of the bathrooms) and the service, as is everything within walking distance or bourbon street was terrible. I went 30 minutes without having a refill. They also sit you at community tables, which is fine, but I did not expect it.",

BP2E3JEvS5u2GTPVj4okZg,,"Chargrilled Oysters are to die for.........Our timing was perfect as we showed up with a line of about 20 people out the door. Host asked how many and with just 2 of us took us right in and we sat up at the bar. Within one minute of sitting I was drinking my first of several Abita's Amber. Of course had to have oysters. Ordered a round of 6 grilled and after the very first one ordered another order of 6. I'm telling you chargrilled with garlic butter and then topped grated cheese. I added a couple dousings of Tabasco Chipolte and it is an absolute must have. I'm telling you I could of just filled up on Chargrilled Oysters. AMAZING, YOU MUST TRY! We then had Chicken Andouille Gumbo, and Seafood platter. Had a few tarters with the shrimp. Oysters, and catfish. For me good tarter is a must if you are eating fried seafood. All was great but really the gumbo and seafood are just good when compared to how great Oysters were.  As we were leaving I noticed the line was at now at about 40 and I have to say that I would without question stand in that line again just for the chargrilled oysters. Enjoy!",
BPRJrEnHgFhwUxxDYOlt5w,"My husband and I went to Hattie B's while we were in Nashville based upon the Yelp reviews.  It did not disappoint!  In fact, we had it twice.  Both visits I chose medium and he chose the hot chicken.  We had sandwiches and then tenders.  The flavors are fantastic!  Hot really is very hot, so take it seriously.

On weekends, Hattie B's is very busy and you will wait in line.  Based on another reviewer, we ordered online for our second visit. 

Hattie B's set the bar for hot chicken!",,

My first meal off the planet and first experience to NOLA was AWESOME.  Ok ,maybe just cuz it was my first time ,i still can't think of anything bad.  
Love the boudin sandwich, and love the grilled oysters.  Big fan of the special po boy half shrimp half oysters!  Sat at the bar, and the bartender was nothing but helpful . 

Definitely going back!",
BPctreQAlxlXTCNdRfdG-w,,,"Overall the dish was good but the shrimp was overcooked.There is no outdoor seating which I would prefer especially in this area.

BPn33O-QTPUyOzFPwmNPfA,,,"Line with around 15 people ahead of us out the door. We were seated in only 10 minutes. Everyone here is so incredibly polite. Shout out to Desiree! Classic New Orleans dishes. The crawfish etouffe and red beans and rice were top quality. Crab cakes were excellent. Only caveat was the bread, while good, was not amazing like magic bread (see YATS (Indianapolis) review) Our bell hop at the hotel suggested this place for dinner and we were definitely not disappointed!"

BPuay26pE0OjelfTKw8ZvA,,"I visit this place every time I'm town. The wait is ALWAYS between 20-45mins so don't be surprise. It moves pretty fast. Small groups moves faster than larger groups for sure. OYSTERS here is the highlight. Raw or Chargrilled is good. Today the raw oysters were about 2-3ins big and super fat and pump!! Only $15-$16 for 1 dozen. What a steal! People these aren't gourmet oysters that you go too for high end restaurants were they are $3-$4 a piece but these are gulf oysters...sweet fat and juicy. So if you're looking for affordable oysters with great quality for the price then come here! The chargrilled is usually a hit or miss but today it was perfect. Finger licking good. They have crawfish when it's in season and it's not the ""Asian"" saucy type but it's the straight Cajun soak in meat flavor. I love it here. The size was definitely large to jumbo and it's only early march. We've tried other stuff here like their po-boys and gumbo and wasn't impressed.  So we stick to our oysters & crawfish when we come here.",
BQCXxsDydmmoJ2qzFXrA5A,,"Acme was hands down my favorite restaurant I tried in NOLA! The line was hefty, but it moved rather quickly. The southern hospitality was through the roof, shout-out to our waiter who goes by Spike Lee (he looks just like him in Do The Right Thing)! I've heard of the hype of the chargrilled oysters and gave them a try...AMAZING! They're packed with flavor and come with bread to dip your life away. After sharing one pound, we had to get another. They're the best oysters alongside the regular ones there too! I love the sauce that comes with those too, so fresh and perfect. We also ordered a pound of crawfish, and now I can't have crawfish anywhere else. They were packed with flavor and seasoned very well. Lastly, I ordered the shrimp ettouffe with fried crawfish on top. This was my first NOLA ettouffe experience, and it was great! It was very light which was surprising because I thought it would be a heavy dish because of the gravy, but it was very light! I practically licked the bowl clean. Ugh Acme's dishes are packed with flavor and love. I highly recommend each of the dishes I mentioned, but especially the chargrilled oysters!",
BQCwWIpbffMJRiIxiXliRw,,,I had the red beans and rice. My husband had the Taste of New Orleans. Food was great and so was the service. Wanted to give a 4 1/2 but can't with the rating system in place.
BQY5xjhzjQJowwLvQ4z8-w,,"For a party of two, we barely waited on a Friday night when the line was out the door. We got seated at the bar and ordered straight from the guys shucking the oysters. We got one and a half dozen raw, half a dozen chargrilled, and a soft shelled crab platter with hush puppies and jambalaya. The oysters in New Orleans are so big, meaty and not at all briny (which could be good or bad). The chargrilled were absolutely delicious with the herb butter sauce. They came piping hot and perfectly grilled without the oysters turning dry. We probably could've gotten more bread if we asked to soak up all that oily goodness! The soft shelled crab was nice and crunchy all around with the meat still tender and not over-fried. The best part of the crab was no doubt the center where it was very flavorful. 

Service was prompt. I would recommend sitting at the bar if you have a small party to watch them shuck oysters.",
BQdYrqDLmrvrOxzsK9kzvw,,"The grilled oysters were sooo good!! Everyone here was so friendly. Nice atmosphere, just a bit on the dark side. If I'm ever in New Orleans again, will definitely visit",
BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,,"Acme is a New Orleans institution so every tourist kinda sorta HAS to eat here at some point on their trip to the city. You'll read about it in magazines and hear about it from all of your friends. You'll see the intimidating line to get inside that stretches around the block. Don't make the mistake of thinking you can walk around Bourbon Street and come back later and there won't be any line. There will be. It's always there. All. The. Time.

I grew up in the South along the coast, so I know good seafood. The seafood here is fresh and decent, but nothing to write home about. To be fair, I do not eat raw oysters (but my husband does, and he said the ones here are good but not super memorable -- and said to be sure to mention that, and I quote, ""the shuckers know what they are doing and they are skilled at keeping the sweet ocean liquor in the shells""). 

The interior is dark and cramped, with long tables where you pretty much sit family style with other people. The tables are technically separated by a 2 inch space. So get cozy and get to know your neighbors! The lighting inside is red, giving the whole place a seedy-feeling atmosphere and making it impossible to snap any good Yelp food photos. This is NOT a seedy restaurant, however. It's packed with tourists and caters to visitors to the city. I can't imagine they'd attract a large number of locals here. 

The food's not as overpriced as you'd expect either, but maybe I'm just used to Southern California prices. Expect to pay around $15 per person for a hearty seafood dinner and soda or tea. (Delicious fresh-brewed iced tea, that is)! I ordered a half and half plate: half a shrimp po'boy that was overflowing with shrimp and a hearty cup of seafood gumbo, and it set me back $14.

As is the case in most of the South, fried seafood is the king here. The shrimp po'boy was lightly dressed and was topped with a slice of the most beautiful ripe red tomato slice and crispy shredded lettuce for a nice crunch. It was the best version of the sandwich I had during my trip (and I ate about half a dozen at as many restaurants). 

The seafood gumbo was good too and a must-have addition to your meal. I was dining with two other hungry guys so they ordered way too much food for us to share as a table, with the best shareables being the grilled oysters (with a pungent and flavorful garlic butter) and the gravy cheese fries -- but who the heck doesn't like cheese fries? 

I wouldn't wait in the line more than 30 minutes to eat here unless it's something that's on your foodie bucket list. You'll most likely enjoy your meal here if you temper your expectations from the hype, but the truth is that it's simply not worth a super long wait.",

I also had one tender of hot which was both hot and more flavorful but still I expected more flavor after trying KFC.  

I'd give it another try because you can order beer there vs KFC.   I also thought it was nice that each tender could have a different flavor.",,

BUbAcfSAXqhwPzAfJobGMw,"While this place was highly recommended to me as a must go to, but now that I've eaten there, I wish I hadn't! Here's why... I really don't enjoy VERY greasy fried chicken or just okay sides. Even though the service was quite good, that alone will never bring me there again.

However, let me warn you that the Damn! Hot and the Shut the Cluck Up heat levels take hot chicken to places that no fried chicken needs to go.  Stick with the Hot and you won't ruin the rest of your day.

Lovely interior courtyard seating with umbrellas.  Attentive staff.

Amazing art by local artist Simon.  My favorite was the sculpture in the courtyard with an homage to New Orleans music and Bayou wildlife-made out of a keg piled high sculpturally with a variety of vintage musical instruments and spires emanating out of the top with symbols of crawfish and other Bayou area wildlife.

FYI-Funny part was the overhead music playing on the patio-it sounded like someone singing in Reggae fashion about cooking up raccoon among other things in a big pot with cajun seasonings and inviting people over to eat. Absolutely hilarious to an outsider and surprising to hear over breakfast (4/28/17). I have to say it was an interesting historical and culinary education (the song) in itself.

About the Writer/Singer of the Song-
FYI2-The song is by local Big Chief Monk Boudreaux and it is called ""Footsteps!""

BVHMV_xv2Ur4Ih9_4yw0iQ,,One of the highlights of our trip! Be prepared for a wait - we showed up at 5 pm on a Monday and still waited forty minutes- but it was worth it!!

The wait can be long, but you can also order on their website for pickup.   I did that and walked in and out within 2 minutes.  Highly recommend doing that if you don't have time to wait.

Overall, this place is well worth the addition to your waist line!   The chicken was most definitely the best I've had, ever.   The baked beans were also quite delish!",,

BVYgBKfgY8kzVgMRGYpgmA,,This restaurant lived up to the hype everyone's been talking about. The shrimp were very tasty and the Chargrilled Oysters were hands down the BESSSSST EVVVVER (I couldn't stop eating them). The Oyster shot was .... DIFFERENT but the only OFF part to me about it was the cocktail ORANGE sauce at the bottom.

BVqflHMF3wlkhQ45Qrxpiw,,,"I can personally attest to the very poor quality of food here. The oyster poboy had oysters so small they were mainly breading. I was told it was because of the oil spill but that doesn't excuse the mouse in the dining room or the nonchalance of the waitstaff. DO NOT EAT HERE. ""Kitchen Nightmares"" did not exaggerate on this."
BVvWkghXzLYHWX-clzopdQ,"Of course you can't come to Nashville without trying Hattie B's. You also can't come to Hattie B's and start comparing it to Prince's. They're completely different and they're both delicious.

I'm sure you already know that this is a tourist stop so my review will be an advice: come here early OR call your order in! If you just want to try it and don't really care to eat there, then just call and order in your food. It will save you lots of waiting time!

Also never come during lunch. Never. The line is so long. I used to work down the street and it is like that every day. 

But you must try it! They have two locations now, too!","How do I convince you to wait in line for this?! Because you have to come here if you've never been!

I got lucky because I was by myself and I got seated right away. I sat at the bar so I got to see them work on the oysters. This adds to the experience so I highly recommend it.

I got chargrilled oysters-- let me tell you, they were SO GOOD! I've had chargrilled before and I've never had it the way Acme cooks it. 

It was covered with Parmesan cheese, butter, and all the goodness in the world. It was so good, I could have ate a whole dozen!

I also had 2 oyster shooters without vodka. Basically I just ate fresh oysters. It was so fresh and their cocktail sauce is where it's at! It had a little kick to it but it complimented the oysters very well.

Seriously, don't think twice. Wait in line. Have great oysters!",
BW-BSf3VHgOk_d30Td1Xww,,"BEST OYSTERS EVER! My friends and I came to NOLA and ate here for dinner one of the nights and we ordered both the fresh oysters and the char grilled oysters. I've never been a fan of oysters... Until I ate here. The char grilled oysters are the best. Tons of flavor.. And butter and cheese lol. We have even looked up the recipe when we got back home because we were craving it so much! Although it wasn't like the actual char grilled ones we had at Acme, it was close enough! 
We also got an array of sides and other dishes but nothing came close to how good the oysters were!",
BW7DkXKrB4UX3JRk_oy8EQ,,My first time in NoLa and I absolutely loved my experience. Pam was our server and she was absolutely the best. I happened to be seated at the bar next to Gretchen (a former employee) and she had all great things to say about Acme and NoLa. I love this place and will come back every time.,
BWCfrCgPHdOMV9zYr4eFrg,"The reviews were right when it comes to the long lines. They were also right in how quickly the line moves because I think my party of 6 got through the line within 25 mins or less that was out the door and turned around front. Having the large group and talking to the local patrons made it go that much more quickly. 

To the food: I wanted everything! Posted some pics of my food minus dessert but oh me oh my! Got the small breast quarter that might have been too much for my normal appetite but since I was starving like Marvin I ate my meal in its entirety. I don't know how they do it but the breast was so juicy and skin crispy w/o being overly so. Got medium spiciness which was the perfect kick for me. Heard the spicy was pretty hot to lip numbness. The fries were fries, still good and baked beans good as well. But that chicken... i'll be back for it.

Why 4 stars? The dessert. Now I make a pretty good banana pudding myself so I compare and pick up pointers. The flavor was good but texture off. I believe they top with meringue and bake it. This I dont care for at all as texture is king for me. The pudding also had more of a gelatinous texture vs a smooth custard. It wasn't your typical pudding for those who like a little variety but I think I might stick to the original on this one. 

Finally the staff. For a young group of people they handled the crowd very well considering. My hats off because they did their thing with pleasant attitudes which unfortunately isn't always the case.  I would say this is more of a 4.5 star establishment.",,

We thought it must be amazing for there to be a line, but we were not too impressed to be honest. We had the fried crawfish tails as an appetizer as well as a dozen of raw oysters. We shared a peacemaker po boy which had fried oysters and shrimp on it (it was big enough for two people). I liked the Tabasco infused mayo on the sandwich. With the being said I've had much better po boys in the past. My favorite of the entire meal was the fried crawfish tails. The oysters were huge, but not briney enough for me- but It seems that is how all oysters are in New Orleans? Later, a friend had told us that Acme was known for their grilled oysters, maybe next time we will try those if we were to come back to New Orleans.",
BWJ_k59Cc5Pix4mNiwXeug,,"This is my FAVORITE place to go for their chargrilled oysters! I also had the entree that sampled red beans and rice, seafood gumbo, jambalaya, and grilled sausage. This is a MUST GO restaurant when visiting NOLA.","This place is open later than most of the restaurants in the quarter and was pretty good. It wasn't the best, but still worth a try. I had a dozen oysters, crab cakes, and a side of shrimp. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for a late night dinner."
BWel3BDT4tYdn2E61dsBDw,"I've been here twice and now I am addicted. Nashville loves their hot chicken, and so do I. If you are not a huge fan of the hot chicken, have no fear, because Hattie B's lets you have it your way. You can get it either mild, medium, hot, or damn hot. The first time I went I got the white chicken plate (you can get dark chicken too) and got it hot. I will say it was hot but not as hot as my taste buds could handle. The second time around I got damn hot. Damn hot is pretty hot but it's a type of hot that has your mouth saying, ""Oh that was so good please put more of that in my mouth!"". The heat does not linger and the spices are delicious. 

When you order a plate you get your choice of two sides as well. The pimento mac & cheese is the best artery clogger on the menu! I'm pretty sure I will get it ever time I venture to this place. I've also tried the baked beans, cole slaw, and black eyed pea salad. My friends were not huge fan of the black eyed pea salad but if you like citrus, vinegar, green onions, and black eyed peas then you will probably like this side (I did).  The baked beans combined with the cole slaw made me realize I am going to miss summer cook outs since yesterday was the last day of summer. 

I hear their deserts are all homemade and amazing, but I have not had the opportunity to try any of them. I am just so full every time I leave!

BXEoJNNIaEJExY1ePMQgVw,,"Did you even go to NOLA if you don't eat char-grilled oysters? Nope. And Acme is a solid choice to give them a try. One con about this place...there is always a line, but that says something right? Probably that the restaurant is small and doesn't fit many parties at one time. Maybe because the oysters are sent from heaven. I don't know. You be the judge. We waited maybe thirty min. Ended up with two seats at the bar. You will get in faster if you opt for the bar, but you must be seated there. If you try to sneak in and sit. They will call you out. Saw this happen to a couple of people...awkward. Just follow the rules people. You can come into the bar for drinks while you wait in line. Make sure you do this if you'd like a drink in line. I made the mistake of going to an adjacent bar and ended up having to chug a massive beer because they will not let in outside beverages. I could've also just thrown it away or been patient for a drink until I got inside, but I had beer on the brain and made an unwise choice. 

Pam was our bartender. So nice! I loved that she did not rush at all. I thought with the line, they would be trying to flip seats quickly, but I did not get this from her at all. We started off with two Abitas and a dozen chargrilled oysters. I don't think I care for Abita's beers, but that has nothing to do with Acme. Our oysters took a bit of time. I honestly think they were forgetten for a bit based on the lack bubbly butter goodness in each of the oysters. It was like they had time to dry up for a bit. Nonetheless, still delicious. We were very pleased. 

Deenies vs Acme. These were two chargrilled oyster places we were told to test. Verdict. Slightly different. Both great. Deenies are cheesier and buttery. At Acme you are definitely going to taste more of the oyster. Still cheesy and buttery, but more apparent that you are eating an oyster. 

We also had the boudin jalepeno poppers, peace maker po boy, and jambalaya. All really great choices. My partner stands by his thoughts that po boys are basic. I mean they are at their core just fried shrimp and oysters on a roll, but there was something special about that tabasco infused mayo. Definitely give it a try. I really enjoyed all of our picks.",

Everything else was just typical overpriced & just OK to me. My nephew loved his Root Beer Float, but nothing else truly stood out for the French Quarter prices.

Basically grilled chicken, fish or steak no sauce or flavor. I did have the crab cakes as a starter which were tasty though a bit expensive as a starter. Management should look at adapting some of the other tasty options to be gluten free which can easily be done!

The goods:
-Bustling, vibrant environment in the heart of French Quarter, a block from Bourbon st. A great way to start off our first night and get us pumped up!
-Their Hurricanes, though pricey, were delicious!
-New Orleans Medley: jambalaya, sausage, gumbo, red beans and rice. A perfect tour and preview of the foods to come!! (I especially enjoyed their jambalaya..so full of flavor!!)
-Their Chargrilled oysters were delicious!! chockfull of flavor!! and so juicy! (as were their raw oysters) 

The bad:
-Oysters were really small in comparison to other places i visited that weekend. (Luke's *cough* happy hour!!)

It's very noisy and boisterous but it added to the fun. Would definitely recommend!!",
BZYOb1-1nD_a0fMp4oCmtA,"We were looking forward to eating here and knew it would be busy so we came at 2pm on a Friday and wait was still over an hour. We did not count on all the college kids who were out day drinking, so it was pretty loud and raucous with plenty of carousing. Not exactly an enjoyable atmosphere to me, but what can I say? I'm almost 43 so I'm old 

The service was great. Very friendly, quick and efficient and they checked on us often. 

Chicken was good. Sides were just ok:
Chicken tenders, medium spicy - good amount of juicy chicken with just enough crispy coating so as not to overwhelm the meat. 
Chicken wings, hot - nice amount of heat. Not too spicy so the chicken could still be enjoyed. Could have been slightly crunchier on the outside, but that may be due to spice coating. 
Crinkle cut fries - not bad. Fries are fries. 
Mac and cheese - ok. A step above KFC but not gourmet quality. 
Baked beans - we did not like the flavor at all. Not sure what it was, but we didn't like it. 
Cole slaw - crisp, not too gloppy

If we go to Nashville again, would probably try Prince's instead.",,

Usually having parties that big things tend to go wrong but this lady was great took everyone orders and literally everything was correct down to drinks and entree's. I won't even try to explain how amazing this food was, everything came out fresh to order. While we ate Kim made sure to come and assure we we're okay without being overbearing.

B_KQKuZ7M8RUrSOadh8-SA,,,"After a late night and waking up late in the quarter, we needed a place that served a breakfast til 1pm. As luck would have it, Oceana is located across from the Royal Sonesta. On Saturday morning, we waited 15 minutes at 12:30. 

Keep in mind, we were looking for Court of Two Sisters price, selection or ambiance but rather a decent meal with a little cajun flair with decent service and price. Oceana actually delivered on all accounts. Yes, the decor and ambiance is cheesy but we got  what we came for. 

The kids did a Country Breakfast (two eggs, hash brown, grits, biscuit and your choice of bacon or sausage for $11) and Classic Pancakes (three big fluffy ones with bacon or sausage for $10.50). My Cajun Breakfast with grilled Andouille and Alligator sausage with two eggs, grits, hash browns and a a biscuit for $13, really hit the spot. The sausage was particularly tasty with just the right amount of spice. The only disappointment all around was the grits.

I wouldn't hesitate to come back here under similar circumstances. We left satisfied!"

I'd heard great reviews about this place so we had to try it. unfortunately, the food was just subpar. I had the popular crab cakes, which were not good at all. I've definitely had better in the crab cake department. And I also had a seafood pasta, which was just ok as well. There are definitely better places to go on bourbon st. When it comes to food. I left disappointed. I'm glad there wasn't much of a line to get in the door like there usually is bc I would've been pissed to wait for just mediocre food."
BblZePNYFHsfAuUSpNZuOw,,"Soooooooo I'm from Seattle and I never planned on writing reviews for anything from my trip from Nola but I must say... These have got to be the best oysters I've ever had. That's a bold statement coming from the PNW.. But it's so true. 

You can bet your bottom dollar there will be a line out the door, and once you get in.. It looks and smells like any old oyster bar, maybe a bit dirtier but you can't quite tell because it's all masked in red light!

We were finally seated and the first raw oyster I slurped up had to be the most balanced, succulent, disappears in your mouth- good, most delicious oyster yet!!! I was hooked! 

We came to New Orleans from Seattle specifically for food and even though I had a list of about 25 restaurants I wanted to dine at we found ourselves here 3 times during our 5 day trip (also conveniently located right across the street from us - we stayed at hotel Mazarin)

The raw oysters seriously have to be the best I've had! Or maybe just the most unique ones I've had? Either way, I ate about 2 dozen in total and each of them were so fresh and so light! None left a murky dirty after taste or were gritty or tasted too much like the sea.. I hate when that happens.

The chargrilled oysters were obviously crack.. Butter and cheese on top these already perfect oysters?! Straight heaven in your mouth! None were over cooked or too chewy. And the French bread was perfect to pick up the leftover sauce er butter.

Annnnd surprisingly, their gumbo was the best gumbo we had in New Orleans!  Corn and crab chowder was delicious too!

The people at the oyster bar were a pleasure to chat with! AND they have chipotle Tabasco!!!! Such a win all around.

My only complaint is.. Why is it so dark and red inside? I couldn't get one decent picture in!",
BbwFSiDGDyq4nogICe3gXQ,,"Saw man v. Food and decided to give this place a shot. Oysters were fresh and delicious. We ordered seafood jumbo and the fried seafood platter for lunch.

I don't know about nola but in Dallas, you get only a few pieces of shrimp and oysters....we're talking about you pappadeaux's!

We got the hot, which was spicy, but not over the top inedible IMO. Although I'm from Louisiana, so we like stuff HOT! All the sides were tasty--the Mac and cheese was my fav! For fun we ordered the ""shut the cluck up"" and it WAS very spicy. I only had two bites of it. The first wasn't awful, but the second was spicy enough that my eyes watered and my tongue burned for a good five minutes of me sipping water! But it was a fun experience everyone should try at least once!",,

The gumbo was good, rich and full of flavor but needed a little bit of a kick which was easily fixed with hot sauce. The oysters weren't that special. We have had better.

Bcut1H_DbHbAIkMltwY_Lw,"If you love fried chicken, Hattie B's is one of the best! The fried chicken was so crispy, nicely seasoned and super moist. It beat a lot of the fried chickens I have eaten in my lifetime. I do not tolerate a lot of spice, so I got to try the mild flavored one (and bejesus it was spicy!). The mac and cheese was good, but on the mushy side. The southern greens was my least favorite - it was very mushy and a bit too salty. We also tried the banana pudding & peach cobbler, which were delicious and freshly made (not the best but good enough).

P.S - There is always a long line, but it moves quickly. Tons of seating indoors and outside. Bathrooms are inconveniently located near the entrance door where everyone is lining up.","The line is always long, no matter what time you come here to eat. Because their chargrilled oysters were so delicious, I opted to be patient and wait. Like they say, good things come to those who wait. This is my second time here, and I came here to eat recently with my sister & a friend.  My friend who has never eaten at Acme's loved the food.

We each ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters & happily finished it.  It was so delicious!  We also ordered the etoufee w/ a side order of fried crawfish & it was to die for (recommended by the waitress). Tried one of their soup specials (corn w/ crab) and thought it was alright. We also had one order of boiled crawfish, and it was not my favorite. 

I have tried their po-boys and rice&beans before, and thought it was ok/not the best. I would recommend to just order their chargrilled oysters & etoufee w/ a side of fried crawfish! YUM! 

Since coming back to NYC, I have been missing Acme & Cochon's foods very much. Until next time!

BdB5rkXN0f3kJl9B9BV_Ng,,,"Where do I start a review when everything in our dining experience was a home run?

We were in town for one night. After walking through the French quarter Oceana was recommended by a couple NOPD officers when I asked for good authentic seafood that wouldn't break the bank.

We knew it was good when there was a line. However we didn't wait any longer than 20 mins. They escorted us in to the third floor and this place is so cool on the inside. Rustic but the smells coming from the kitchen were awesome and inviting.

Our waiter ( Mike - an aspiring actor from Michigan ) quickly got to our table and took our drink order. He was top notch. Very friendly and helpful. We started with the gumbo as an appetizer. It was my fiancé and 16 year old son. So having a teenager can be a challenge when you want to try something new. The gumbo was amazing! My son said the best he's ever had.

I had the red fish special with collard greens and a crawfish sauce on top. My son had the crab cakes with collard greens and mashed potatoes. My fiancé had The Taste of New Orleans. My son said "" this is the best meal I've ever eaten in my life"". Words can't describe the amazing food and experience.

This is a great family place and reasonable in a city filled with the best restaurants."
BdEBhR0yhgSf2QbjPF0XQw,"I really don't get the hype. I was lured here by the ravings of the hipsters and that's exactly what I found...a long line of raving hipsters out the door. 

The good:
The chicken is thoroughly seasoned, not just on the breeding but rather all the way to the bone. The pimento mac & cheese was outstanding. 

The bad:
The wait was absurd for what this was. My wife is a wimp so she got the mild...way too hot for her. I like spice but want to enjoy my food so I got the medium...way to hot for me to enjoy. I tossed half my meal in the trash. Look, I've eaten spicey food all over the place in chains and local restaurants. I've even eaten wings at places that purposely try to kill you (WWC braveheart and the like). My complaint is not that it's too hot, it's just not advertised hot enough and the flavor itself isn't very good. 

Go here if you want to check it off your list but that's about it.",,

BeA4KvEtF8iBaUwxDs8XQQ,"I was a bit nervous to go to Hattie B's because I wasn't quite sure what ""Nashville Hot Chicken"" even was. I was imagining chicken wings dredged in buffalo sauce and I wasn't a fan of that idea.

I have now been twice in one week, so to say I ""liked"" it is an understatement. I was excited for chicken tenders (not having to eat meat off the bone is always a win) and that it turns out the seasoning is like a dry rub on the chicken and has nothing to do with tabasco/buffalo sauce from what I can tell.

The wait:
Worth it. The first time I went was at night and it was warm and drizzling and super muggy. The line was down the entire building and we waited about an hour but had heard the wait was worth it. It was! The second time it only took about 20 minutes to get through the line.

The ordering process: 
You order at the counter and then fix your own soda/tea/water. They give you a number to take to your table and then bring your food to you.

The food:
The two times I ate there I ate three tenders with a side of fries and I've also had the baked beans and pimento Mac n cheese. I've had the tenders in mild and medium.

The tenders are very large and super juicy. The mild just left me with a small amount of warmth after and the medium let me feel the heat the entire time I ate. I tried a friends bite of their hot one and I got choked so I would have been miserable. 

The ranch dip is good with it and the fries are good. I had heard great things about the pimento Mac n cheese, but wasn't thrilled with it- it was just okay and won't order again. My friends and family ordered ""Hot"" chicken with ""southern greens"" and really liked it.

Go eat it - it's good and worth the wait.",,

Beu6ibBJoFbiNjicQgW_3Q,,"We got to visit this restaurant during our trip to New Orleans. It was such a great idea. The restaurant is super packed and there's always a line so you know it's good. But that means you have to go early to get a good spot.

We waited about 30 minutes to get in. We sat at the oyster bar and was able to get a full menu. We ordered oysters of course. They shuck the oysters fresh right in front of you. It was super fresh.

We also ordered the wood grilled oysters. I don't usually like cooked oysters, but these were amazing. I just squeezed a bit of lemon and some hot sauce in it and it was great. 

We also ordered the jambalaya with sausage. New Orleans obviously makes the best jambalaya. It was super flavorful and the rice was perfectly al dente.

We also ordered a basket of fried shrimp because we saw it come out for someone else and it looked so good. We thought it was going to be super greasy and breaded but it actually wasn't. And the shrimps were even flavored. The fries that came with it were also very good.",
Bezh6tDmCrL0-SnsV6CneA,,"A visit to Acme Oyster House is requisite for any oyster lover. 

Granted, the first time I came here during my 28 hour trip was for jambalaya. My friend wanted jambalaya and we got that along with some gumbo and oyster shooters. The jambalaya and gumbo were good but not out of the world amazing. A tad bit too salty for me. The oyster shooters were strong (maybe we should've mixed them better). 

After we ate here I met up with Angela C and read her review for the Metairie location... I will jump on her bandwagon and STRONGLY recommend the chargrilled oysters. When my friend and I were perusing the menu, I said ""Ew, I don't want to eat cooked oysters"" when I saw the chargrilled item. I bite my tongue. As Angela later described to me in person, as I was salivating, the oysters are shucked and placed on the grill in its half shell and then some delicious things are placed on top of the hot oyster, French escargot style (which I also LOVE). The chargrilled comes in 1/2 dozen or a dozen. The 1/2 dozen was more than enough for me...

But, that did not stop me from ordering the 'peace maker' fried shrimp and oyster po boy. This was my last stop before the airport and I needed to maximize my NOLA food intake. The peacemaker is huge. Angela and I shared one. Its hefty height makes eating messy. I like the tabasco-infused mayo and the oysters here are so fat and juicy! Also recommend. 

Don't come here if you're looking for something healthy. A lady sat next to me and asked the bartender if they had steamed veggies or salad. ""Is cole slaw salad?""

I will mention that the two times I came here during the late weekend afternoons, I went straight for the bar. We had excellent and friendly service from the bartenders. The second time I came, I thought I'd arrived just in time - they had a employee holiday party starting at 5pm, but they continued to seat people through 4:40pm ;)

This is a great place for a good, cheap bite.",

Although there seemed to be a long wait because of the line outside they were able to get us in quick. Would def come back next time I'm in NOLA,"Waiting staff were friendly and very attentive. The restaurant is decorated like an average restaurant chain, very casual place. Food was surprisingly mediocre. Crab cakes were okay but the seafood platter was nothing but cold, rubbery, soggy fried fish. Granted we were there right before closing hours but, that's no excuse to serve food that isn't freshly made. Everything was definitely overpriced. Not to mention, the place felt like an icebox! It was a beautiful 72 degrees outside but they had the air conditioning blasting. I couldn't wait to get out of there to warm up outside. Not on my list of places to revisit.

The wait is long-- but there's a reason for that. It's worth it. Don't complain about the wait if you don't want to taste excellence. Also, whoever said the price point is higher than it deserves is out of their mind. $26 dollars got us a sandwich, 3 tenders with an extra wing, 4 sides, and banana pudding.

Blackened chicken fettuccini Alfredo 
Blackened gator bites 
Cajun fries
Oysters 
Strawberry Mint Margarita

We had a table near the balcony so we could look out the window at the shenanigans. There were a lot of cool artifacts on the walls to check out. The best part was our server. She was attentive and kind and gave a cute thumbs up every time we asked for something. Her name was long and I will probably mess it up, Shanericka... I'll edit this when I remember."
BhwaJuqrwt_Stlf4XndzzQ,,"This is ALWAYS our first stop in New Orleans.  

O.K., actually our first stop -- and a rather long one at that -- is always the Baggage Claim carousel at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (aka MSY [why?]).  

O.K.. O.K., then we stop at the line and wait for a cab.  (But usually not very long at all.)

O.K., O.K., O.K., then we stop at the front desk and check-in at our hotel, and then we stop in our room, but definitely our FOURTH STOP is always Acme for a couple of dozen oysters and a pitcher of Abita Amber!  ( http://www.abita.com/ )  It's a wonderful match . . . 

Flying in from California, we always seem to get there right after the lunch crowd has left, and right before the after work/dinner crowd arrives.  And with the two-hour time difference, it's a perfect lunch for us before going back to the hotel to change for our evening's feast . . . .",

It's one of those places that will please anyone that is hungry, craving something that they are unsure of, and want to be left satisfied.  Price is a little on the heavy side, but well worth it."
BiPx0LoTBOjrNBdsEl6Vaw,"One of the best Chicken joints I've ever been.

I ordered a mild small dark (leg/thigh) with Mac and cheese and baked beans.

Chicken had a hint of spice, which was perfect for myself. It had really crispy skin. A bit oily, but the taste was phenomenal!

Mac and Cheese wasn't anything too special, in my opinion, as well as the beans.

I would highly recommend this place!",,
BighBfV7maUUIgfH4Ew_vA,,"Seriously don't know what the hype was all about. To be quite honest, this place was okay. It definitely is not a favorite. Came right before they opened and there was a line already forming. Waited about 15 minutes before sitting down. The inside was quite different from the rest of the restaurants. It wasn't upscale or classy, it was more of a chill, let's get drunk, have fun, and eat, type of ambiance. Service was almost nonexistent due to the fact that the server only came by to drop off the food and drinks, and that was it. Ordered po boys, jambalaya, and oysters. The po boys tasted like any other po boy that is out there, the jambalaya really wasn't what was expected, especially since a friend that's from Louisiana said that it wasn't a true jambalaya, but the oysters is definitely the best bang for your buck! Should've just stuck with oysters for the experience. Overall, this place is fun and lively, but it's not the worth the wait in line. Try other places that isn't so populated because the food can be just as good or ever better.","Wanted to go to a place that didn't have a long line or that wasn't a huge tourist spot. Went pretty late, probably near closing. There were not much customers and the service was pretty slow. Got seated towards the back near the kitchen and it was pretty dim. There was also a leak in the ceiling which disrupted the experience. The roof looked like it was about to fall down and it was right next to the table. So instead of enjoying the food, the concern was more towards the leak. All they did was put a bucket underneath until they figured out what the problem was. Foodwise, it was okay. Ordered oysters and jambalaya. Nothing spectacular about it. Don't think a second trip is in the near future."
Bj6zLDXf7Y0tQu8gAtzANg,,Came here while on vacation in NOLA.  If you don't like oysters don't come here.  If you do it's a must while in the Big Easy.  We got the grilled oysters and man I'm still dreaming.  I also got a Po-Boy (World Fried Peace) which was pretty good as well,

Everything we ordered was consistently well-prepared, and while it won't knock your socks off, it is hearty and delicious, home cooked cajun food.  Be prepared for bigger portions than you typically expect.  The crabcake is pretty good, as are the gumbos, crawfish, etc.  Well worth a stop."

BlI91UEca-_BLwRPOwvJrg,,"This was my first experience with oysters and after much recommendation, we visited Acme Oyster House in the French Quarter. Expect a line outside the door, as you usually have to wait before getting in unless you arrive early. However, if you are a smaller party (we were only 2) you may be offered a bar seat and get to skip some of the larger groups in line. This was actually a great accommodation, as sitting at the bar allows you full view of the staff shucking oysters behind the bar-which is quite the spectacle! They have great technique and the amount of oysters they shuck in the time you sit there is unbelievable. We ordered the char-grilled oysters and a bowl of jambalaya. The food arrived very quickly and was quite good! The jambalaya was delicious and spiced perfectly, and the oysters were a great first experience. They also offer oyster shooters, which we did not try, but looked like a fun choice (fresh oyster in a shot of vodka). The atmosphere is fun and friendly for a late night dinner, although a little loud, and staff was efficient and helpful. This is a high profile restaurant in the area, so check it out if that's what you're looking for. It's worth the experience!",
BlWvozwhbCii48BqqJrA0w,"On a Sunday, we pre-ordered online and set it for pickup. I'm glad we did as the line was extremely long out the door. I wasn't sure what the issue was with the order however we got some errors that Fries were unavailable and other meals didn't get the error. We ended up changing all of the orders to have no fries due to the error however when we got there, there wasn't a shortage or fries. 

I ordered a mild hot chicken sandwich which came with cole slaw and pickles and a side of baked beans. I think if we ate the sandwich right away it probably would have been better, however since we walked to a diff spot to eat our meal i felt that my sandwich might have been too soggy. The seasoning on the chicken was good.

I think it was definitely a good experience and i enjoyed trying it. not sure if i would wait in the long line for the food but then again not sure if pre-ordering was the best move since my meal was soggy.",,

There is always a huge line outside and I don't know why!!!! The food is just average but the chargrilled oysters were phenomenal as we've never had oysters prepared this way dripping in butter and parmesan. 

We took a tour with a group of 5 other girls who had also dined here and they said they didn't think much of the po'boys or the gumbo which is why we didn't order it. While we were there, the table next to us got the gumbo and they didn't finish it.",

BmCI9_Oxg7018TOxvnUPEg,,"This quintessential New orleans oyster house has been doing it for a hundred years and the wear on the raw bar shows it.  ""It"" is oysters mostly and raw primarily, ""Shuck em and Suck em"" as it says on the menu and so reasonably priced compared tp Philly you could fly down, get your fill and fly back and almost break even. An exaggeration certainly but you wont get that guilty feeling when downing 3 dozen. Watching their shuckers do what they do is mesmerizing, getting that lid off without breaking the ""bubble"" and never ever getting a piece of shell to the customers mouth, and all in a single second.  The oysters shooters  with the house made Louisiana hot sauce difficult to stop eating once you've started.   Raw oysters are the meat so to speak of the Acme's business but don't ignore the fried oyster platter or the oyster po boy, transcendant!  Boiled crawfish, mudbugs, in season from December to summer are a must for those who like crawfish, which I can take or leave.
Red beans and rice with andouille so basic and so satisfying when it done right as it is here.  

The gumbo with the starter ""debris""  flavoring the dark roux imbues the nasty looking gumbos with multiple layers of flavor that is rarely duplicated outside of a great New Orleans seafood  house such as the Acme.  The decidedly no frills decor is light years away from the somewhat weary turn of the century elegance found in Antoines or Galatoires but the culinary experience is tremendous and no seafood loving visitor should leave New Orleans without checking it out.",

BpFVkK6qthcNEHFne8HqFg,,"Went here later at night (around 10) on a weeknight with my friends and there was no wait, so if you are desperate to go to Acmes, I'd say this is the way to do it. We got a bunch of Apps: the raw oysters,the chargrilled oysters, boo fries, fried crab claws, fried crawfish tails, and the New Orleans Medley.

Raw oysters: I didn't enjoy them, they weren't horrible but they weren't really good, I've had better in New Orleans and all my friends agreed.

Chargrilled oysters: these were much better, they had a great flavor and I think the sauces masked the lackluster oysters they used

Boo fries- they are fries, great when you are drunk, the gravy sauce was a bit on the salty side but, I mean, they are fries you have to be a horrible place if you can't make decent fries

Fried crawfish tails and fried crab craws- same as the fries, it's deep fried how can you do these wrong? They were good but you can get the same thing at like every other restaurant in NOLA and they are almost all going to taste at least decent.

New Orleans Medley- this was so forgettable, nothing on the plate was that great and you can find everything there done much better somewhere else.

I also got an oyster shooter and it was disgusting, like legitimately horrible, of course it was cheap so maybe that's why.

Overall Acme's is over rated, the only thing that's really good that you can only get there is the charbroiled oysters (that's why it gets the 3 stars) but I don't know if that's a good enough reason to go because you can get great oysters at other places",

Bq85EvNPQwWo61cbOtdBbA,,"Old review: from a visit backin July 2011

3 solid stars for food, atmosphere and price.  Checked out Acme on the first night of my NOLA visit. On a Wed evening there was about a 15 min wait.

Got the seafood gumbo, crawfish étouffée and fried oyster po' boy.  Gumbo was good but my small cup size portion didn't justify the $6 price tag.  Crawfish étouffée was delicious - good portions of crawfish.  Wished I had foregone the cup of gumbo and got the large étouffée instead.  The po' boy was a good size and had a nice amount of fried oyster (not skimpy how some places can be).  The fried oyster was delicious and the batter was flavorful and wasn't oily or greasy at all.  Service was great!

All in all, it was a good meal on short notice.  Glad I came and enjoyed the food but I wouldn't necessarily say it was a ""must go"" place, but then again,  I didn't have the oysters that everyone raves about.",
Br5W9tFIDWoUQe9SNLJhWA,,,"Road in front of restaurant is currently under construction so it's a little tricky to find. But once we were inside we were seated right away, on a Monday afternoon. The service was the only good thing , and food came out right away. The issue was the food, the oysters raw on half shell were room temperature warm, and just off. We were not able to finish them, and the manager was not happy to talk with us about it. We also got the taste of New Orleans which was decent but overpriced for what you get, the Po-boys and catfish platters were much better. Overall we will not be coming back."
Br7NfAxcRprDceabsyxZNg,,,"The taste of New Orleans is tasty meal. This place lives up to the hype and reviews. Located just off Bourbon Street so the location is good too. The servers (Jessica and Taylor) are very helpful and friendly.

I give it one star off for that.",

After 45 minutes in the cold and rain, we are seated at a somewhat dirty table and handed menus that were definitely dirty. There were bits of food on them! Ick!

Half of our party decided to try both the raw oysters and the char grilled oysters. I was told that raw oysters were good, but certainly not the best anyone had had and not the best that they had tried while in NOLA. The char grilled were different, and no one had tried anything like them. The garlic parm sauce did smell amazing, but what wouldn't in garlic parm?

The rest of the party tried the gumbo, a po boy, the crab cake platter and the New Orleans medley. The food was enjoyable, but not special. The one thing I will say that was a huge disappointment was the crab cake. It was like a hockey puck of fried filler with some slight crab taste. Not really recognizable as crab. The hush puppies were good though. 

If you like oysters, I can see why you would come here, but if anyone in your party does not like oysters, then go somewhere else where they serve oysters, have a shorter line, but also serve other food which will likely be better than here.","Came here with a party of four and were seated pretty promptly. Our waitress came right over and took our drink and food order and almost instantly our drinks were served to us. And that was about the last time we saw her again. 

Actually, I am wrong. We saw our waitress multiple times, almost constantly, but that was the last time she came to our table. This woman actively avoided eye contact with us for over 45 minutes. It was weird. Then we turned it into a fun little game by seeing how far out of her way would she go if we kept looking. She served other tables their meals even though they came in after us. Finally her manager came over and just straight up apologized to us and told us he would bring us our food even if he had to cook it himself. Did I mention that it was weird?? 

The food was decent. Nothing too memorable. Between us we tried the blackened catfish, blackened chicken, rice and beans, and the blackened chicken salad. Nothing that I will remember, but I will remember the uniqueness of the service."

I will definitely return to Acme Oyster House when I'm back in New Orleans.",This place is simply amazing!  I was in New Orleans around Christmas and a lot of restaurants were closed.  This place was recommended by the locals and I thanked them afterwards.  We ordered their famous crab cakes.  It was so much crab meat and the sauce on the top with crawfish was just to die for.  A bowl of gumbo was topped with small crab legs and it was not salty like many other places.  Bloody mary drinks were perfectly made.  The highlight of the night was their oceana redfish.  I highly recommend this dish.  Our waiter had the knowledge of the dishes and so accommodating.  I can't wait to return back to Oceana Grill.  It's definitely on my list with Deanie's and ACME Oysters.
Bt-wBUlzjt3XSGu6qhW57g,"I might be in the minority here but hot chicken is not that good. It's basically a test of how much heat you can handle. Then your tastebuds are fried and you cant taste anything. 

I stood in line for about 25-30 minutes but after getting in the door the ordering and delivery of food was good. There is a menu postcard where you can order from along with a menu in line where you have to wait. Since it was a Saturday, they should've two cashiers so the line can get moving but there was only one. They ask to wear a mask in line but as usual, there were people who could care less to follow the rules and no worker was saying anything to them. 

The cashier was friendly and they have indoor and outdoor seating. There is a section where they do carry out and delivery. A lot of people ordered take out and it seems like that was the way to go. I ordered a lemonade with tenders with hot heat level and Mac and cheese with fries. The portion of the meal was pretty decent. I was hesitant that I would not be able to finish the meal but luckily I was able to. 

I didn't see feel anything special about the chicken. I just felt the meal covered my 2000 calories per day intake. It's ok and I'm glad I tried it but I doubt I will come again.",,
Bt6gmjnWHPERhiOTQOhuEA,,"Oysters aren't for everyone.  I know many great eaters who have no interest in slurping down some slimy salty goo with hot sauce.  Truth is, raw oysters don't really do much for me, I can take 'em or leave 'em.  But.....what if you grill them on a BBQ in their shell and cover them in melted hot butter and parmesan cheese.  Hmm....now that will convert some reluctant foodies over to oyster lovers.  It's like the escargot of New Orleans.  Acme Oyster House has been at this location since 1924, so this for sure is the spot to try those chargrilled oysters.

Reading the other yelp reviews I wasn't expecting much with the rest of the food here.  But sometimes low expectations brings surprising results and the fried shrimp and boo fries were also quite tasty....here's the blow by blow.

Chargrilled Oysters - I actually thought they would be a little firmer in texture since they were cooked, but were more like medium rare.  This was fine for me, but my wife still wasn't quite sure about them.  The briny garlic butter cheese topping was very powerful and a drop of the hot sauce also added the perfect finishing touch.  To me the french bread is very important with these to scoop the oyster on top of.  They were happy to bring us extra bread, as it was served only with a few pieces.  Either way, you are going to want to use the bread to soak up some of the butter.  I did get a surprise crunch along the way and sure enough ended up with a tiny pearl in my mouth.  4.5 stars

Fried Shrimp - These were simple breaded butterflied shrimp.  The batter was nice and crunchy and not much more than salt and pepper added to it.  Plain old tartar sauce was fine with us to dip the shrimp in, but you can play around with buffalo sauce or hot sauce too.  The side of potato salad had a slight mustard/relish flavor to it.  Fries weren't anything too special but also piping hot right out of the frier, so not much to complain about.  4 stars.

Boo Fries - French Fries smothered in shredded roast beef, brown gravy, and cheddar cheese.  The cheese was almost a throw away here as all the flavor really came from the brown gravy and tender roast beef.  Perhaps a cheese sauce may have worked better in this messy pile of goo.  It was good though and if you are looking for some comfort food, this is what you'll want to order.  4 stars.

Service wasn't the friendliest here.  Apparently they have a strict no photographs of the grill area policy.  I didn't know that how you make chargrilled oysters is a government level secret.  Just thought it would make for a cool photo.  But sure enough the grill master yelled at me...""NO PHOTOS!!!!""  How about just post a sign that nicely says ""please don't take photos of our grill"".  Rather than yell at people who are just trying to enjoy the experience of your restaurant and perhaps share it online.  Being that I'm all about food in my reviews- I'm not going to take a star away because the grill guy was rude.  Truth is everyone seemed like they didn't want to be working.  It was Easter Sunday, so I get it, they most likely didn't want to be working, but try to be nice to your customers anyway.  We arrived about 10:45 am just after they opened and got a seat right away.  Sure enough, as we left there was a pretty darn long line out the door all queued up.  So I would say plan ahead and eat at slightly off hours, unless you want to wait.",

The outside was crispy and full of flavor and the meat was juicy and delicious.  My sides were fries and pimento Mac and cheese. Both were good, but nothing to rave about. It's all about the chicken!

You'll just have to see when you come to acme. Third hint - the folk in line whom were also visiting raved about it. It appears to be a few people's spot when they come to visit. Fourth hint - hell, we ate the food ourselves! 

We ordered a bunch of apps which was more than enough! I usually can eat apps and an entree. But the portions are pretty sizable. They will recommend the chargrilled oysters. Get them...a dozen of them.",

We were seated at a 6 top table (we were a couple of two) with two other couples, which was ok there was alots of room. We ordered drinks and food right off the bat. Food come out super quick and was tasty. My husband ordered a second beer which didnt show up...waiter didnt come back for over 20 mins -we had to call him over and then just asked for check at that point. The table we sat at was in the back and it was pretty dark-waiter seemed a little overstretched","My husband and I decided to come here on a whim after a long day! We were greeted by a hostess who was super friendly. Our wait was 10 mins, max. The food was great to me but seemed more of like a tourist trap which we were tourist.

We seat upstairs which was nice and cool. Ladies room could use some work."

It was so good and I was raving about it. The next day, we decided to order it again but this time for delivery. I called at 9:59 pm. I waited for 2 hours and the food never showed. In between that time, I called twice and the first time I spoke to Fatima who told me that it should be coming. I asked her to go check and she told that she didnt see any delivery orders on the counter so it must be out on delivery. She clearly didnt know what she was talking about. SMH. I called back an hour later and asked for the manager and they said my order fell through the cracks and it was never made. He offered me 50% off and a cheese cake for my troubles. We went back the next day and I should have never done that. The food wasnt the same. I guess they figured since we were already gettin 50% off, no need to give us a good amount of shrimp. We literally had 4 shrimp on each side of the po boy. My friends crawfish po boy was completely cold so that means it was just sitting there. The etouffe tasted like dirt. I will never eat at this shit hole again. And will tell people not to eat here. Delivery method sucks and food sucks. Im very disappointed"
Bv_1C57JuBM9j2BbbwQ1bg,,"Let me preface by saying, I don't like oysters. They're slimy and sloppy and not my thing. I was on a trip with 3 friends and the general consensus was to have lunch here. I was a little apprehensive at first but decided I would try the Chargrilled Oysters I had heard so much about. I have to say... THEY WERE DELICIOUS. Lots of grated cheese, lemon butter, and french bread. I mean, what's not to love. I also had the Seafood Étouffée which was yummy however I wished I would've had another order of Chargrilled Oysters instead. Yes, they were THAT good.

Believe the hype people, make the 20 minute line, and ENJOY! It's totally worth it!",

BwFHoqC7mE7BgzwKy66vNQ,I highly recommend calling and placing your order for pick up to avoid the line. Food was ready in about 25 minutes. All utensils and sauces were provided. The employees were so quick and friendly! Wish there was a Hattie bs in Chicago! I highly highly recommend the large dark legs with pimento Mac and cheese. Drooling just thinking about it. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was delicious. I will warn you... the medium is spicy. So the hot is extra extra spicy. Beware! The hot chicken sandwich was also equally delicious! I think ours was missing the coleslaw but still so good! Can't wait to be back in Nashville. In love with Hattie bs!,,
BwK_3tCG64jF7drGQD4Tfw,,I really wanted to like this place.  We had fresh oysters that were acceptable.   Also an order of fried crab claws.  They were pretty bad.  They tasted like breaded nothings.  All breading and no other flavor existed.  Beer was cold though!  We passed by other oyster houses that may have been a better experience because of Acme's popularity.  Sorry but I just don't dig Acme.,

Everything else was great as well... I got the Jambalaya and tried a bit of my mom's New Orleans Medley.  I also appreciated how even though our party was there for more than 2 hours catching up (don't worry, we kept the beer and food coming), they didn't try to rush us at all. Service was good... attentive enough, but not overbearing. 

Definitely recommended, especially for visitors. They offer a good variety of New Orleans style cuisine that tourists would want to try, and the food is delicious.",

I can be THAT customer with all the questions and pickiness but she was so patient and courteous. It was such a great experience. I would return just because of the customer service alone. Do yourself a favor and stop by and grab a hurricane a slab of tender ribs.
BxXEXnFX8xeG7Y56-XXHZg,,"Chargrilled oysters were pretty awesome but a littler pricey and kind of small! I wasn't a fan of the raw oysters at all, I thought they were too watery. Also, watch out for the cocktail sauce because it already has horseradish and I didn't know that so I added my own and experienced an embarrassing tearing session in the middle of dinner. The fried catfish was actually very good, catfish is usually just catfish but this was so fresh!

Helpful hint: there's usually a long wait but they actually told me that tables of 4 get seated quicker than tables of 2 so make friends in line!",
BxcS6tYaQwykzBm0heozXw,,"If you are an oyster fan, you have to visit Acme!  If you aren't an oyster fan, you have to visit Acme!  We visited on a busy Monday (the day of the NCAA National Championship) for lunch.  They had us waiting in a line outside and we put our name in.  Several groups behind us with the same number as us got in before us.  I'm not sure how that works, but it didn't bother me a ton since most places around had a 45 minute wait.  We ended up waiting about 40 minutes before getting in.  

The restaurant has a small, dark, diner/dive bar feel.  The lighting was red colored lights which bothered me, but I noticed a lot of places in the French Quarter had similar lighting.  We sat by the window so it wasn't that bad.  

The chargrilled oysters were recommended to me and, even though I am not an oyster fan, I decided to get a half dozen.  Best. Decision. Ever.  They had such a nice grilled flavor along with the butter they add.  I loved them!  I wish I could get something like that in my hometown, but I won't hold my breath.

It was LOUD in there, so be prepared.  The waitress had to yell everything at us.  She also forgot about our drinks so we got them halfway through the meal after we reminded her.  I also ordered the shrimp etouffee.  It was alright... nothing special there.  Everyone in my party raved about the oysters, but the other food was average. 

Overall, I would definitely go back, and maybe order 2 dozen oysters this time.","We made a dinner reservation on a Sunday night before the NCAA National Championship.  We were seated immediately.  The place is dark, with lots of red light, and a little cramped.  The service was great.  The waitstaff is awesome and were very attentive at anything we needed.  I had a shrimp poboy.  It was very good and a lot of food.  I couldn't even finish it because I got full.  Everyone at my table was happy with their food.  The other customers were so much fun and we got into a lively discussion about football.  I'd love to go back and try more from their menu!"
BxclsQXrRXhicya6KPIiHA,"I was ready to be a skeptic; hot chicken? in Midtown? But my defenses fell quickly.  Hattie B's is true to Nashville's hot chicken heritage while solving some of it's traditional inconveniences: they have porch seating, draft beer, credit card machines! But before your inner-hot-chicken-snob says it can't be done, take a bite...amazing.

The surprise is a sweet note just under the cayenne crust.  The meat is juicy, not dried out.  So you can expect  a 30 minute wait that is well worth it. Call ahead and save some time.

While I was waiting, a young fella was loudly protesting his 20 min wait, as the staff patiently worked to get everyone's food perfect.  Eventually he was offered his money back as other customers shook their heads at his rudeness.  The manager treated him with complete respect even while being badgered about a wait that was only1/5 of what it would be a Prince's.  Good form.

Hattie B's gets it right and earned a place in my hot chicken rotation.",,

Worth the 45 minute wait in line. This was hands down the best fried hot chicken I've ever had in my life. 

I got the hot and then the damn hot the next day. I really enjoy spicy food and have a high tolerance. The hot is good, spicy but not overwhelming. The damn hot is very spicy. Definitely hit the top of my threshold for comfort and tolerance. I could still eat it though and that's all that mattered. I can't even imagine how the next level up is - Shut the cluck up.

The food is also great. It was my first time trying alligator, but I enjoyed it and found that I prefer the fried alligator. My husband had the redfish fillet as an entree, while I ate grilled shrimp alfredo and all of it was good. During our last visit, a waiter overheard that it was our anniversary and he surprised us with a pretty good dessert. 

Due to Covid, this is currently one of the only spots in Nola that allows one to make a reservation. I strongly suggest making a reservation as there could be a long wait."

BzLUyHSJrl-lUVWw9rqlvQ,,"Our first meal in NOLA was the Acme Oyster House. Since it early already early afternoon and dinner reservations were coming up we decided to grab a quick and simple meal. Luckily throughout our vacation to the Big Easy by making reservations we really missed all the lines and long waits. Acme was very busy but we were seated right away. Our order consisted of a couple dozen oysters, a couple ponds of boiled crayfish, and a fried seafood platter. 

The NOLA oyster is different from the Pacific oysters, they are bigger and meatier. The Pacific coast oysters are more briny and harder in texture. The NOLA oysters are softer. 

We ordered the first pound of Cajun boiled crawfish, they were so good we ordered another pound.  

The best item of the meal was the breaded fried fish of the seafood platter. I forgot to ask what kind of fish it was but it was so tender. With the platter there is fried oysters, shrimp, fries and slaw.  

Acme is a super casual restaurant some paper plates and disposable plastic cups are used but the food was excellent. The line to get in was 30 deep by the time we left.",

I want to say there were about 20 jumbo shrimps in there but it may be an exaggeration because I was so full. The server was friendly and provided good service. This place was busy and if you check-in on yelp, you get a 10% coupon! A great way for this place to generate reviews on yelp and draw in more customers, and the customer receives something too! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because our table wasn't very clean when we originally got there. The tables and chairs were out dated that could use some sprucing up but it also could be the style. We did have to wait in line for a seat when we first got there but it went by pretty fast, maybe 10min wait. We also tried gator bites, first time trying, tasted like chicken!

My friend had a seizure and ended up getting rushed to the hospital. Nick called and texted and made sure my friend and I were alright. Nick was adamant on bringing our food to the hospital but i told him it was unnecessary. I told him I wanted to buy dinner for the ER staff (work in the same field and know there are many nights they go hungry from being too busy) and he told me not to worry about it and to come back to the restaurant and talk to Ariel. There was a line wrapped down the block and When I showed up, they took the extra time to ask about my friend and ended up giving me approximately 4 Palates of food. Enough to feed the entire ER staff twice. They charged me $8.00 for it. I want to tell you all that I will never ever forget this hospitality and basic human kindness that most of us unfortunately lack in todays day and age. We are all so quick to react and think ""Oh well that's not me, I'm a good person"" but Nick, Ariel, and Hattie B's stepped up and SHOWED that. They didn't ask for anything in return and showed why Southern Hospitality is second to none. As far as the food goes, The chicken was mind blowing, and the best i've ever had. they gave me nearly all the sides on the menu and the Mac and Cheese, the Baked Beans, and the Collard Greens were to die for. There was nothing I tasted that I didn't enjoy. The ER staff says thank you guys by the way. You made their entire month. They send hugs your way and want you to know that it was all eaten by the hard workers over at Centennial Med Center. 5 stars isn't nearly enough stars this place well deserves.",,

This isn't to say food was bad, it just isn't as good as other places and comes off as touristy. The fried oyster and shrimp poboy was good and a good portion but very overpriced. My partner also didn't like that they don't de-vein the shrimp. Their char grilled oysters were good but much smaller sized than other restaurants. While it was delicious, their recipe and the quality of the oysters don't really stand up to Drago's. The wait to get in was about an hour, but the waitstaff was really nice.

I opted for hot after hearing very hot had ghost pepper dust.  The hot was spicy, but it didn't overtake my tastebuds.  The wing and breast came together so you couldn't mix and match the spiciness.   The chicken was very good, a bit dry, and the skin was super crispy.

My inner fatty really wanted to order more of the chargrilled but I also can't resist soft shell crab.  And theirs was calling my name.  Went with the Soft Shell Crab Platter while friends got the New Orleans Medley.  
The soft shell crab wasn't as crunchy/fried as I hoped it would be but the crab itself was satisfying.  And the portion is HUGE!
Although I didn't try any, friends loved the medley - they definitely licked their plates clean.

C4XO8LHaliK1L5kGAmpHEw,,,"Great food and service. I got the ribs and the BBQ sauce that they cover it with was amazing! The taste of New Orleans, which my boyfriend got was perfect for someone that wants to taste a little bit of everything. The great part about this place is that it's open till late, so if you're looking for a late night dinner this is your Spot!"
C4_adgwIlyVnv32axzlf8g,THE BEST HOT CHICKEN EVER I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Worth any wait and everything there is good!!! A must go to in nashville I could go there every weekend!,,
C4geqfzXQkIZzPueNpy4HA,,,I was NOT at all happy with this place. The service was great but the food was so mediocre. I'm from Los Angeles and was so looking forward to eating creole food. I had the blackened red snapper and it was so dry. It was covered in a seasoning sauce that had no flavor to it. Don't recommend.
C4lYkbpygOrMaSe6N7z83Q,,,"Very yummy! One of the only local opened places at that hour. Blackened Catfish was very good, Taste Of New Orleans is a must!"
C4pUCxphn1knXnsXmTpOdA,,,"For any other town this would be a four star restaurant. But there are so many great places in New Orleans that I would rate this as average. I've been here multiple times, in my opinion its very touristy, but if its your first time in New Orleans then great, come here. Blackened Duck and Royal Omelet were pretty good."
C5BZdZmpbAxThU-wHgdZPw,,,"This food was good however, the customer service here sucked. They didn't bring out our oysters until we were getting ready to pay the bill. I didn't like a drink and the manager refused to give me a full refund and only half because I had drank some already. Total waste of time."
C5DND0-9NAE-fzkYq4OMWw,,,"Taste of New Orleans$17. Crab cake, seafood ""Gumbo"" were good . Could have been little bit more warmer especially Gumbo ( kind of stew which has rice + fish+ misc) . Very quick service! Outdoor seating was nice."
C5RK95Ulk2s4IEmsEh0Mxg,,"This place was on Discovery Channel I think as #9 of places to go in the US. I have been there several times. The raw oysters are of course easy, but the different types of cooked oysters are very good! The crawfish is very excellent but it is TOO pricey. I mean, $9 a lb was a bit high. The prices fluctuate according to the beginning, middle, or end of season. The crawfish size also varies but over all a great place to go. Be patient for the long lines. Have one person stand in line and the rest can go to the corner and get a drink while you wait for a table.",
C5ZURywW9_xhgUlCJaJ-RA,"AMAZING CLUCKIN' CHICKEN!!! 
I love spicy food and was tempted to get the damn HOT but I'm so glad I didn't! The HOT is really hot but bearable. The baked beans are to die for! 
Super delicious and worth the wait!! 

5 stars for the FAST SERVICE and amazing food!",,
C5eZtFsNBlwy6jp0z1m7jw,,,I can highly recommend the Oceana redfish. Crawfish sauce is amazing.  Whitney did a great job.

C6HhgU7nVnUe5SY04_W3ag,"Great hot chicken in an easily accessible location. Although Prince's is an institution, Hattie B's definitely wins for atmosphere. Definitely try the mac 'n cheese with your chicken- it's outstanding! A solid choice for a uniquely Nashville experience.",,
C6JQXisUZPZdnst0GlT9nQ,,"This place gets busy really fast, but it's worth the wait.

I sat at the bar and watched the shuckers shuck fresh oysters. The food was so delicious, it did not disappoint! I'm usually not a fan of hush puppies, but there's were the perfect crunch to moist ratio. Also a dozen fresh oysters was $18.",
C6KaCLPD_zLH66lfogLwMw,,"Really wanted to give 3 and half stars but opted with 4 stars! 

The chargrilled oysters were good but personally the ones at Dragos in Metairie are better in my personal opinion! While these were good they had some stones in the oyster which were a bit off putting! 

The fried crawfish tails on the other hand is a must! They use this fancy sauce that I used on everything! It's the yum yum sauce( ketchup and mayo mixed with a little bit of cocktail sauce). 

Also the fried fish platter was good but needed a little bit more seasoning! But for the price their combination platter included fries and coleslaw with 3 pieces of fish which was good! 

While you are here take a visit and try their drink specials as it was awesome!",
C6_ViNwMNnLHDbbtCwDZuA,,"Chargrilled Oysters, where have you been my whole life?? I think I love you... WOW, just wow.  I never liked cooked oysters before, but decided to give it a try because my friends raved about it.  I initially planned to order just half a dozen of the chargrilled oysters and half a dozen of raw oysters.  However, my friend convinced me that I can have raw oysters anywhere, but chargrilled oysters were a specialty of Acme.  Glad I followed her advice!

First of all, when the waiters delivered the chargrilled oysters to the table, I was fascinated to see that the oysters are still sizzling, such a beautiful sight to behold :)  I was worried that the oysters would be too buttery and cheesy that they would lose their brininess.  Even though it was true that oysters lost their ""oyster-ness"", i.e. the brininess, the satiny texture and the taste of sea, it didn't matter because that butter sauce was amazingggggg.  I was slurping down these babies at a superhuman speed, and can totally understand how someone can eat 14 dozens of them in one sitting (according to Acme's wall of fame).  I was sharing a dozen with my guy and we finished within 5 minutes.  We looked at each other, and wordlessly decided that we need another dozen. I also have to mention the bread, it was the perfect delivery system for that delicious butter sauce.  Words cannot describe how happy I was eating them.

We also tried the New Orleans Medley and a side of potato salad.  Both were good, but paled in comparison to those oysters.  I really wanted to come back and get two more dozens of oysters before we left NOLA, unfortunately we ran out of time.  This is a definite stop if you are in NOLA, my friends who weren't big fans of oysters became a convert when they tried the chargrilled oysters.  If they open one in NY, I will be the first in line!",
C72TBkFw9rXyVh7RD3VCKw,,"The place was not that good! We had to wait  an hour to be seated with a group of 10, they kept seating smaller groups first and we could see empty tables. Inside was very loud and you had to yell to talk to the person across from you. The food was just ok. The seafood gumbo had very little actual seafood and no flavor. The fried oyster were good and the fried seafood platter was ok.",Very good food and service!! The blackened gator bites and crab cake appetizers were the best I have had. The fried seafood platter was very good also. The special was blackened red fish and it was a little over cooked but the flavor was very good.
C7DDO6UzROgq9Y5gO6RaKw,,"The charbroiled oysters are to die for! I will definitely be stopping in ACME any time I'm in NOLA to get some! Even with the line, you have to wait it out to try the delicious Oysters! You won't regret waiting!!",
C7FOub4PXEeh_cSnqb5L7A,,"5 stars for the food, 3 for the service. I figure 3 is a good compromise.

I thoroughly enjoyed my food. All of the food, especially the oysters, were delicious. There will probably be a line, and that's okay. Wait in the line--it's worth it! I had both raw and grilled oysters. Fresh, cleanly shucked, delicious. Dining partner's Etouffee was flavorful and I almost regretted not ordering it for myself.

Our waiter did his best with what he had to work with--a bartender who ignored him multiple times. I watched the waiter demand our drink orders throughout the meal, and the bartender would wave him off and would go talk to people or otherwise occupy himself. Our meal was all but through when we canceled our drinks. The waiter went behind the bar and made them himself and brought them to us, complimentary. It wasn't necessary, but the gesture was very much appreciated. No manager was visible to address the situation.

Restaurant is loud, but just know you're walking into that! Very clean facility as well!",
C7GjJNChp1uVxeVaYfhGFw,,,"Great menu selection but the evening that we had a quick bite, service was slow. Beware if tipping waiters with a credit card but tipping with cash and you need change for your bill. They will keep the entire amount. It must be a regional tactic behavior."
C7Nhs4uOu8Sys3xDrC3EeA,"We did the touristy thing and went to Hattie B's at opening on a Saturday morning. Waited in line for about 45 minutes, got our food and enjoyed it.
Would I say it's the best fried chicken I've ever had? No. But it was good. Would I go back and wait in line again? Likely not.
The medium definitely has a kick to it, the mild had a slight spice. The mac & cheese was creamy, potato salad was nice to damper the heat. And the banana pudding was great.",,
C7pVJtxnqReTjs7Gz7gjcA,,,"My husband & I went here for lunch.  The menu isn't that extensive...I thought there would be more items to choose from.  I ordered the shrimp alfredo.  It was amazing!!!  I am usually hesitate to order that because I know a lot of places will short you on the shrimp...not this place!  I got 12 large, plump, succulent shimp with a decent amount of pasta.  I like that they don't overwhelm you with pasta and skip out on the shrimp....the ratio was perfect, and actually slightly favored the shrimp.  The flavor of the alfredo sauce was one of the best I've had.  My husband had the crawfish etouffee and really enjoyed it.  Service was quick and friendly, and we got our food in a timely manner...even though the place was packed!   Would definitely go here again, but just wish they offered more of a selection."
C7rz29oHZBCcbcySixMcsg,"I loved Hattie B's Hot Chicken, and I'll tell you why.

First, we asked five Uber drivers about the best hot chicken in Nashville.  They all stated it was Hattie B's.

Second, we went Saturday evening and despite groans about long waits and a line we suffered neither.  Orders were taken promptly and efficiently.

Third, our chicken came out quick and hot.  Orders were all correct and the server asked if there was anything they could do for us.  Everyone there was very friendly.

Fourth, this chicken was fantastic.  Moist, cooked all the way through, and proper amount of heat depending on what each of us ordered.  The side dishes were all fantastic, as well.  I wanted to keep eating, but my wife claims she heard my arteries crying for help.  Probably for the best that I stopped.

Fifth, and this is the best part, I decided to try one wing that was at the hottest level possible.  Just because that's how I party.  Two bites and I needed some help, fast.  I asked a server for a cup of milk and one was brought promptly to our table.  They didn't even charge us!  The wing was good, too.

I will be returning to Hattie B's every time I travel to Nashville, and wish more establishments would take a cue from this place on how to take care of its patrons.",,
C7t1Jaha23kRaudGlotPPg,,,"We had oyster and the ahi tuna.  Tuna was cooked perfect and was well seasoned,  the oyster were good sized and fresh.  Enjoyed the experience."
C7xugvjzMhmPkADOEGkQdw,,"Overall 3.5 stars Raw Oysters and the Soft Shelled Crab are the high lights. 

Service: 4.0 service was good but not outstanding, friendly servers but nothing memorable. 

Food: 4 stars but there are good and bads so not all the food is 4.0 stars. 
Goods: 
Raw Oysters were great, they tasted fresh and came with some of the condiments, only things missing is the fresh horseradish and the oysters didn't come on ice. 
Soft Shelled Crab: The crab is huge and tasted great. 
Bads: fried crawfish, don't do it, you won't taste anything but batter. 
Grilled Oysters: they were over charred and some were burnt, I have been told that ACME makes some of the best charred oysters but when they over char it just throw them away, we received one decent dozen and another that was too charred. Should of sent it back but we ordered so much other food we didn't care. 

Nice to try but not a spot I would rave about or wait in line for.",
C84JWSiBG0fCmR_QaU1f6Q,"After all the hype about Nashville hot chicken, Hattie B's naturally made it onto our list of must-visits. We came on a Saturday afternoon and waited in line for 2+ hours! It wasn't until after that we found out we could order ahead of time. 

The food itself was delicious. I ended up getting the small dark meat plate. Each plate is served with 2 sides as well! I went with the mac and cheese and the potato salad. For dessert, we went with the banana pudding. Let's start with the star of the dish: the chicken. I only got mild and to be honest, you could not taste the spice at all. However, the chicken itself was soooo good! Incredibly juicy and tender.  No bad things to say about the sides either! The banana pudding was to DIE for. I'm normally not a fan of pudding or bananas but their combo was incredible! 

Service was also really great! Despite being slammed with people for hours on end, the waitstaff was still super friendly. Southern hospitality at its finest! 

The indoor seating portion is very small, about 5 tables at most. The outdoor patio is much larger. If you come during a really busy/hot day, be prepared to have to eat your hot chicken outside!",,
C8hcUdC7WwEwXm1LjN2EVw,,"Ok, had heard about this place prior to my trip.  So, on Sunday morning we were wondering around aimlessly.  Found ourselves on Bourbon St - cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning!!!!!  So, we had a few beers here and then and then headed to Fat Tuesdays for a frozen concoction - then decided to walk and find something to eat as it was getting about lunch time.  So, we stumbled upon Acme Oyster House along with just about everyone else that was awake on the sleepy Sunday in New Orleans.  There was a line about 20 deep.  There was a girl with a clipboard - she take your name, just the number in your party.  It was a little confusing but that could have been my frozen concoction kicking in - we were finally to the front of the line and the girl with the clip board was a total buzz kill when she informed me I had to ditch my frozen concoction!!! BOO!!!  Upon  entering I wanted out immediately - very small space tables right on top of each other, awful service.  Our waitress had way too many tables to be able to keep up.  We got our drinks after our entrees.  I ordered the New Orleans Medley - a sampling of Gumbo, Jambalaya,
Smoked Sausage and Red Beans and Rice.  It was all ok.  Maybe I should have had the oysters instead.",
C8iQH-v_E44UMSAiuqPGaw,,,"3.5 stars: We heard you had to try redfish while in NOLA and we saw this one was topped with a creamy mushroom crawfish sauce. The sauce is awesome! But I learned that I'm not the biggest fan of redfish. It's a bit firm in texture and therefore, a bit chewy as well. The corn and mashed potatoes that this dish comes with were delish and I found myself enjoying them more than the protein.

We ordered the crab cakes as well, also topped with the same sauce. The crab cakes were pretty good! Crispy outside, moist inside, and they were huge. 

Service was friendly and attentive. Overall, decent food, but nothing out of this world and nothing that has me craving to go back."
C8s19e3llxSSz6Pexxhwlg,,"Trust me. Not a good place to go. My server had an attitude. Forgot some items that i ordered. She didnt even wrote down. She was never coming to see if we were ok.

I ask for xtra lemon and she got mad!! Lol 
Theres much better places to go in New Orleans. 

Only thing that is a must try is the charbroiled oyesters.",
C9p07jPr5sDawF2n51uFuw,,,I had the house special which was redfish with shrimp in butter garlic sauce across the top over a bed of jalapeño cornbread. It also came with collard greens all of it was fantastic also at our table was the seafood platter which was huge the redfish platter which was excellent. The service was excellent as well. I highly recommend this place.
CA9i8HsWyS9p4QKPJSioJw,,,"The Restaurant is definitely a different design, but awesome atmosphere.  The waiting staff is polite and they are fast to attend to anything that you need.  The food was amazing.  Absolutely delicious and everything came out at a great pace.

Get the famous oysters!! Soo soo good! Empty plate!"
CAH9NR6FM60-VtImFMYOlQ,The line was deceiving. We got right in and ordered our food. It was delish. Excellent friendly staff and service.,,
CA_-p57EWi0vVws04HlKSw,"The food was great and the staff was amazing! We had a fun experience here, would highly recommend and we'll go back for sure. I had the damn hot tenders with a side of shut the cluck up sauce and combined they lit me up!! If you're unlucky and have to stand in line waiting to get in, they have a water bucket with cups so you can stay hydrated.....very nice touch. The staff was so great that it made the experience that much batter. They open at 11am, we got there at 10:40 and we're number 7 & 8 in line, we nailed it and will do the same next time. If you can't handle extreme heat, steer clear of the 2 levels of heat I ate. My wife said even the hot was very spicy and she likes heat. Be careful and have a riot there!",Great grilled oysters......service was lacking. Cold French fries didn't make us warm and fuzzy.,
CA_p0t7uRrZ1QpEh6y8-VA,,,Amazing food and even better servers. My server was Errol and Derrick and they both were really attentive and professional. They also have breakfast which is bomb! Definitely will go back when I visit!
CAiaHPdzEB9lrfhUQeGOTw,,,"The line was ridiculous, but it seems as though they move you through as fast as possible. Luckily, there are two or three floors of dining space (each with their own bar).

The food was really good; I had the fried shrimp platter with fries. I was honestly surprised at how much food they gave me. They also have a great selection of specialty cocktails."
CAjcV7B3L_pM7xx0pUzLKg,"I didn't just eat here two nights ago, I was lucky enough to spend a short time in food nirvana while devouring what was, without doubt, one of the best Southern meals I have ever enjoyed in my life. As someone who has spent a lot of years living in the South, I know of where I speak.

Yes, there are lines, but it's worth the wait. We were there on a Wednesday night around 7 p.m. and stood in line for about 15 minutes. The line moves at a steady pace, so it was not an unpleasant experience. The menu is straight forward and simple, so ordering exactly what you want is a quick decision. Don't let the lines keep you from enjoying the food and atmosphere. If the food was not all that people praise it to be, people would not hesitate to opt for one of the many other places in town that offer Nashville's signature cuisine.

Both  me and my partner had the medium heat chicken (I had dark while she had white meat) with sides of collard greens, bakes beans, pimento mac & cheese and the black-eyed peas salad. Everything was beyond delicious and perfectly seasoned. Warning, even the medium heat is very spicy. Not to the point where it is too hot to enjoy, but just enough to feel a slow, steady burn from the first bite all the way to the swallow. Unless you like enough heat to melt your brain, stick with the medium. The chicken was cooked perfectly crispy and there was ample meat on all of the pieces. Every one of the sides was an example of traditional Southern dishes done right with just enough flair to make them stand out. I highly recommend the collard greens. For such a simple dish, Hattie's has found a way to make them into something that would make even the most jaded Southerners sit up and pay attention.

Cannot say enough good things about this place. Just go and find out for yourself. You will not be sorry for the decision. Oh, and also a shout-out to the staff. They were friendly and helpfull at every turn. Good job team.",,
CAocAgjgi8LvsbKd1ixKGg,,"SEAFOOD ÉTOUFFÉE
Seasoned in a buttery roux, with seafood over rice.
Added fried crawfish tails for 3.99.

Buttery deliciousness!! The crawfish tails were HIGHLY recommended by my server, Gary and they delivered the meaty crunch I didn't know I needed. 

CHARGRILLED OYSTERS
Sizzling, chargrilled oysters saturated in an herb butter sauce, topped with a special blend of cheese.

The best oysters I've EVER had in my whole life.... you know how when something's so good you hv to just stare at it for a min, examining HOW something can be soooo good. That's ACME charbroiled! They arrived sizzling, screaming their goodness from the kitchen to my table. 
_____
The service was AWESOME!! Gary's recommendations were SPOT ON from my prickly pear mojito to adding the crawfish in my seafood étouffée. GREAT JOB, GARY!!

I will DEFINITELY be returning! These charbroiled oysters have elevated my palate.... I feel elite now!",
CAy9p64kj5wARJ0X9aX_mQ,,Food tasted old. Like it had been cooked and left hanging over the fryer. The server was nice but the food.....not so much.,
CBP7YkyoRenwXNyLOru7eg,,"The waiters are so nice. Helpful information. Knowledgeable. Got us seated even with a crazy line outside. The grilled oysters come out piping hot. They are good. Not amazing but good. And HUGE. The fried crab claws are soo good. Highlight of the meal. 
Shared the mixed po boy with my husband. He got the shrimp side and I had the fish side. The bread is different than other places. It's not crunchy on the outside. It was soft all the way around. Like a hoagie roll. I liked it. Hubby didn't. I wonder if it was leinheimer bread or not. Hubby thought it was stale. Idk I liked it. He hated his fried shrimp po boy bc it was baby fried shrimp and not juicy succulent shrimp. People say the marts and Deli's are the places with the good stuff (po boys) so do yourself a favor don't order it from here and get something else.",
CBQc_k5E0GhQWv8xathiJQ,,"Great atmosphere and kind staff, however a louder environment makes it difficult for conversation. The chargrilled oysters were great and a half dozen can definitely fill you up enough for a full meal.",
CBcSBECs-2uQrG_xvq_laA,,"I am not a fan of raw oysters but I went here and had the 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 oyster po boy dressed, no pickles. It was really good stuffed with a lot of shrimp and large oysters","Looked over the menu and it looked good, saw good reviews here and there was a line outside, all good signs. We were seated in the very pretty courtyard out back for our meal.

Went and started off with the alligator sausage, something I've never had but never afraid to try need things and being from NYC you don't really see that much. So glad I got it! It was wonderfully smoked and anyone who tells you this tastes anything different than a good smoked meat is lying cause you would never know the difference.

On to the entree, I had the crawfish etoufee, a perfect sized portion. This one was more of a tomato based unlike the others I've seen served but that was fine because it was very good. My mom, sick of seafood all week, had the 1/2 rack of bbq ribs. A very nice portion and also very good, meaty ribs. 

For dessert we really had wanted bread pudding but like other places around we saw that they made it with cocktail fruit inside which we were very put off by. The waitress brought us a lil piece of it anyways at no charge and we didn't like it. Read my review for the Gumbo Shop's BP, that's the way it should be. 

Overall, a good place to have a good meal at a reasonable price"
CBcVLRQBySr3IdjLB5jOwA,,"I don't think my trip would have been complete without these darn good oysters. Quite frankly, I haven't had my share of oysters to say whether I like them or not. I ordered a half dozen chargrilled oysters to share with my mom. I really should have ordered a dozen because the oysters were amazingly delicious. Freshly buttered with just the right amount of seasoning... I think it's safe to say that I like oysters.

Besides that, we shared the seafood etoufee, which was delicious. I was expecting bigger portions since everything else we've been ordering was so big. We finished with dessert - bread pudding, which was excellent!

Oof! I think I just ate a month's worth of calories in just four days here in NOLA, but it was well worth it!!",
CBiigamq7r87kv_vfmYczQ,,,The atmosphere is always alive and vibrant. The wait for two is usually under 30 mins on a normal day. If you have a large group please reserve or you will be waiting a very long time. The crab cakes are heaven and the fried shrimp is delicious. My boyfriend get a the Catfish Lafouche it his favorite dish. Everything on the menu is awesome you can't go wrong with any item. Check them out for Brunch as well it us very good.

We were bummed crawfish was out of season (say what?!!! crawfish capitol and there's no crawfish? they must ship them all to cali goddamnit). We ordered the jambalaya and the oysters. The jambalaya was too salty i thought. The oysters on the other hand was delicious! we ordered 2 dozen of the chargrilled oysters since everyone was raving about them (and according to our bartender, they sell more than alcohol!). Its a must try here! There's usually a huge line, but it goes fairly quickly.",
CC5Moc7o9y3aOV74XT1oXQ,Fresh made dishes that are fairly standard. The chicken is juicy and meaty. However I feel the place is overhyped due to the trend of Nashville Hot Chicken. The Shut The Cluck up lives up to its name and burn reputation....but take away heat and you're left with average food. It was worth the one time experience but not really a place I would go to again or eveb recommend to anyone unless your goal is to try the spiciest foods.,,

CD5x3LTQpEsx2miAPn_bCQ,,"This place is legit.

Yes, it is a tourist hot spot and you should expect a line.  But more importantly, Yes, it is worth the wait.

To put things into perspective, I tried only one other oyster bar during my NOLA trip which was also good, but I was skeptical of the long line and that ACME would be a tourist trap.  In fact, the first time we lined up, we left and ate elsewhere...but my inner tourist just had to try again so the next day we tested the waters and scoped out the line shortly after 1pm (thinking it might be shorter).  Lucky for us, it was -but not by much.  It was a rainy overcast day but that didn't keep the hungry tummies away.  There was still a line (moved relatively quickly) and we decided to try it out.

We had a dozen raw oysters, a dozen chargrilled, and a ""peace maker"" po boy (half shrimp half oyster).  All of the above were great!!  ACME did NOT disappoint and lived up to its hype.  Don't you love when that happens?

As with most places in NOLA, can't go wrong with the food.  So you decide if you're willing to wait it out and say that you tried ACME (on a side note: not the same experience of course, but there's an airport location as well and we had a po boy there before our flight took off -still good.  they also have the oyster offerings after noon, but not as extensive of a menu (no peacemaker po boy) .  Enjoy!",
CDBCcALM4PAUVQc_82jbag,,,"REALLY surprised by all the high star ratings... my experience must have been an anomaly...but between our table of 4, NONE of us liked any of our food or any of our service :-\

We were lured as Super Bowl visitors by our Baltimore Ravens flagship radio station 98 Rock being broadcast here, and the atmosphere was definitely cool, we will give it that much.  But that's where the goodness stopped for us.

I think our poor experience started right at the door.  There was a long line, and we kept seeing people walk up to the front of the line, say something to the hostess and she'd put her arm out to cut off the people waiting in line and gesture for the line-cutters to go ahead in.  Maybe they had a reservation or there was a private party going on, and that is totally cool, but when we asked why they were being let in, we were ignored.  Guess we weren't dressed well enough.  But for someone who drove 18 hours to get there, I thought I looked pretty good, but I was sooo hungry, I just wanted to get in and eat ravenously so I tried not to care.

So we were finally seated- albeit, right next to the kitchen, and of course we were going to give it a look, I mean the door was swinging open a lot, so we might as well.... and we were pretty disgusted with what we saw.  The floor was disgustingly dirty, crap was all over the walls, and the cooks didn't look very clean either.

Though again we tried to look past it, we weren't at all surprised when our food came out tasting pretty terrible.  The po' boy bread was hard and soggy at the same time (definitely frozen, then microwaved), and covered in bagged lettuce (looked like the stuff that Subway uses).  The tuna special was legitimately HARD all around the edges.  Had to cut them off with a KNIFE like I was a kid who didn't like crust on my sandwiches!

We felt extremely rushed by our server, who cleaned up without asking if we were finished and was quick to bring the check.

Oh, but the bathrooms were clean.  That's all I got."

CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,,,"Really solid spot to grab a tasty bite when in the French Quarter! Our first day in the Big Easy  we stopped by here based on the Yelp! reviews and the line was stretched so far down the street we decided to keep on moving. I remember thinking it must be pretty good for all these people willing to wait through that line for it!

Luckily we were walking by earlier and, SCORE!, no line at all! So we moseyed on in and decided that we just wanted to sample a few different things so we ordered the combo platter. We opted for the fried seafood platter ($22.99 I believe. Definitely not the 17.50 it says on their website lol) plus a Diet Coke and a water. With taxes, our tab came to $28.

The combo platter was very tasty and had both of us filled and satisfied at the end! I personally am not big on the oysters, but loved the shrimp and the catfish! 

Jennifer was our server and she provided very good service. Refills were taken care of and we were checked up on several times.

We enjoyed our meal here and would certainly not hesitate to come here again and try even more of their menu!

4 stars."

There was a wait, but the bar had full service and open seats so we sat there. Bartender Curtis was very fun and kept our drinks full the entire time. I ordered the crab cake and hush puppies plate, my cousin had the fried fish and shrimp and a cup of gumbo. Everything was delicious and very large portions, each of our plates were $15 or less. Fries were just okay and both of ours weren't too hot but the food made up for that. 

It's called the Oyster house for a reason, so don't skip on a plate of these HUGE Oysters. We got them charbroiled and covered in a garlic butter sauce that we soaked up with the fresh french bread which was served on the side. Great food, service and well worth any wait. Prices are decent for the amount of food you will get and drinks weren't too bad either.",

On Thursday night we decided to try again and fortunately there was no line. I started to question my choice as we entered, it's a tad run down and not what I expected given all the great reviews. But looks are deceiving.

The food here is great. The oysters didn't look like the best  I've had but they sure tasted the best and the fried oyster po boy, excellent. The star of the show here was the etouffee. Coming in second was the pecan cobbler.

There is a sweet flavor to the chicken as well so it blended nicely on my taste buds. As soon as I walked in and heard Nelly, I knew it would be a party! After my dinner I did my chicken happy dance because this place is legit! Added bonus...they serve the chicken on top of bread so it soaks up all the grease and the hot sauce! Bread never tasted so good!",,

My friend got a seafood omelette and hash browns. Best. Hash browns. Ever. Also, our waitress Deanne was so helpful. She gave great food recommendations and just general stuff to do in New Orleans as well. I definitely want to come back for dinner or lunch before I leave. 5 stars all around."

We tend to shy away from the popular or tourist- acclaimed restaurants. Year after year, we've had recommendations to try Oceana, so having run out of unique options, we finally decided to give it a try. Were we disappointed? Absolutely not!!! I like to say that I will eat almost anything, but I complain about most. I truly do not have one single negative thing to say about our experience here. We were seated immediately. Our server took time to explain the specials as well as to point out the menu favorites. We chose a dozen chargrilled oysters, the Redfish Oceana, and a special- blackened ahi tuna stuffed with crab dressing and served with jambalaya and the most delicious turnip greens. Every single bite of each dish was amazing! From the second we walked in until the time we left, our experience at Oceana was more than we had hoped or would be!"

Charbroiled oysters, drowning in a heavy fishy sauce served with a side of stale bread (also covered in sauce to hide the fact it was stale) and crab cakes...  We were told they were the house specialty. The sauce. Oh my word. More off putting sauce all over everything. The crab cake itself had the texture of sawdust.

Had a shrimp poboy, fried shrimp, fried fish, fried softshell crab, and chargrilled oysters. I liked the fried shrimp the best.  The poboy wasn't bad but nothing special. The crab kinda tasted weird...I'm not a crab expert but it tasted maybe a little spoiled in the center. The chargrilled oysters were a bit on the greasy and salty side- had alotta parmesan  The service was decent.",
CH1-dp-zhNotEmfZvFsujQ,The chicken was seriously so good. I got one of the super spicy options so my mouth was on fire but could not stop eating it. Next time I'll be sure to try a less spicy option and really enjoy it better. Over all great experience.,,
CH1TxHx6Wq2mVJgCayxSmA,"I've had some great fried chicken in my day what with living in NYC and leisure or work traveling to the Carolinas, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, and the like.  I have my top lists depending on what geographic area I find myself in, but nothing prepared me for the flavor burst and textures at Hattie B's Hot Chicken.  Great options for anyone unable to choose between dark and white meat and heat level.  

I got the half bird which provided for plenty of chicken for one person - half was dark and half was white (the dark was best) - served over slices of white bread to sop up flavor lost on the way.  

Crispy, spicy, flavorful, and juicier than any fried chicken I've had.  Aside from bones, there was not a single inedible bite in the meal.   Typically, even at the best places, you'll have portions that are all fat or tendons.  Hattie's was an all around delight.  A beacon of light in a dark age.  I went in bummed about a future with Trump at the helm.  I left with not a worry in the world.  It was ""buy a shirt on your way out good.""  Hattie B's is not to be missed.  I will be dreaming about it until my next trip to Nashville.",,

CH7hqv7GSDb4Ai179EvmFg,,"We ended up a tour of NOLA on Iberville Street so we decided to wait in line for 2 seats at the Acme Oyster House. We were not disappointed. We sat at the bar for lunch right in front of our new friend, Norman, who was schucking oysters continuosly. A very nice man, I might add. We tried a few Bloody Marys and ordered the raw oysters and chargrilled oysters. The raw oysters were cold and delicious. They were gone in 5 minutes or less. Then we shifted our attention to the chargrilled oysters. I was expecting them to be like clams on the grill with butter on the side. Nope, they were grilled on the half shell with butter, seasonings and some melted cheese and they were nothing like I have ever had before. Awesome!!!

Then my wife had half a fish Po' Boy and a cup of Gumbo and I had a sampling of their Gumbo, Grilled Sausage, Jambalaya, and red beans and rice. The food was very very good. It is a very cool place to sample some of the cuisines found only in NOLA. You can never find a restaurant like Acme Oyster House except in New Orleans.Very glad we went. 

We have been running into celebrities just about everywhere. Super Bowl Champion Antonio Freeman was sucking down oysters at the bar with us having a great time...",

Piping hot, perfect amount of cheese and garlic better topped huge oysters. Just amazing. Mkt price on 5/25/21 was $24.95 and worth every penny!  Also split a 10 napkin beef poor boy which are server Michael suggested we make it a surf and turf by adding fried shrimp with a spicy honey sauce and that really made the dish.

I spent an entire weekend eating around Nashville and this was the best thing I ate.  Order extra and take left overs!,,
CI_qUhzFHZxVgPZGXICG-w,"My husband and I HAD to try Hattie B's while in Nashville after seeing them on Food Network, and hearing great reviews! We ordered the hot large dark leg quarters. It was HOT but, so flavorful and juicy. And, they were huge! For sides we got the greens, black eyed pea salad, baked beans, pimento mac and cheese, and potato salad. The greens were super tender, and seasoned so well. Not at all bitter like some I've had. The black eyed pea salad was like nothing I've ever had. It was really light, and refreshing, with a nice dressing that was sort of sweet. The pimento mac and cheese was uber creamy, and the pimento really did the trick to amp the flavor. The potato salad was also super creamy, and the potatoes were soft and fluffy feeling. The baked beans were robust, with tons of delicious sauce so that they weren't dry. For dessert we tried the peach cobbler. OMG! It was so fresh tasting in a wonderful peach sauce, and a flaky crust.
It's definitely a must try restaurant!",,

CJ6oD9vl_S-yC_6qdi8MBw,,"So this place is on the list of places one must go when visiting NOLA and my impression of the food...eh it was ok. We went Friday afternoon and waited only for 10 mins tops (party of two) before we were seated at the oyster bar. Totally didn't mind because there were at least 3 parties ahead of us. Sitting at the oyster bar was kind of cool to watch them breaking open the oysters and such. One of the guys doing this took our order and basically acted as our waiter. He was super nice and made sure we were taken care of. I had to try the chargrilled oysters and honestly, I had better at a sports bar in another area of town. My boyfriend had raw oysters and he said a few were grainy so I don't think he was impressed. Our alcoholic drinks tasted more like juice than an adult beverage so I wouldn't waste my money. We both had the shrimp po boy and let's just say I had higher expectations. I probably won't be returning when I visit NOLA again, but at least I can say I've been to the ""famous"" Acme.",
CJ9KuDU2YPkXnV2qr76FcQ,"Yum! Wow! Boom! Ridiculous! Killer! Scrumptious! Amazing! Insane! Boomshakalaka! Tasty! Tender! The words to describe this place are endless. By far the best hot chicken in Nashville and country. I've had princes, 400 degrees, biscuit love... This place knows it's competition and beats it every time! I love this place.",,
CJBO0RheMlZOnuY-_xKDyg,"Went in the winter time on a Friday night. Called in our order so our food would be ready when we walked in and wouldn't have to wait in line because we heard it gets busy. Our order was sitting on the counter waiting to be picked up. We didn't need to confirm our order with anyone. In any other city this would have been a place where takeout orders get stolen by other people. 

I had a kid's meal: southern chicken tender with fries. I didn't get any type of spice because I didn't want to deal with all of that going on in my mouth. My friend got mild and my other friend got medium. They both like spicy food but the friend who got medium was dying from the heat and the friend who got mild was glad she got mild. Our food was kind of cold probably because it had been out waiting on the cold counter.

It was basic. If I had to come back I'd try their mild. I'd still call in my order because i don't think it's worth waiting in line for. 
They should think about improving their takeout/online/call in order system so that food waiting to be picked up is kept warm and not able to be taken by just anyone and turn the heaters on inside because it was cold dining in during the winter.",,
CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g,,"For our last night in town, we decided to grab dinner at Acme Oyster House. It's extremely popular (evidenced by the number of Yelp reviews, along with the long line out the door). We showed up a little early and were told we had about a 15-20 minute wait - not really that bad for a large party. We got seated in the middle of the restaurant at a long table, and the service was pretty decent - food came out pretty quickly, as did the beers (in plastic cups, making it easy to carry out on the streets).

The food here is quite solid as well, but I would give a hearty recommendation to NOT get the oysters raw. I've never had Texas oysters before, and now I think I understand why - when served raw, they're probably some of the worst oysters I have ever had...not that they aren't fresh, but the flavor profile is so bland and uninteresting compared to either East Coast or West Coast oysters I have enjoyed over the years. That said, they are fantastic when fried or chargrilled, and boy - are the chargrilled oysters here delicious. They literally just put herbed butter and cheese on them and throw them on the grill. That was quite delicious, and it's a nice hearty way of enjoying the texture of the oysters with a shot of flavor that makes it pop. As for the fried oysters, I had them in my Peace Maker po' boy, and with that spiced mayo, it is excellent. It wasn't as spicy as the po' boy I had the night before (somewhere else on Bourbon Street and lost to my drunken memories), but it still packed a bunch of flavor and was extremely hearty without overdoing it.

In all - yes, it's a bit touristy, but once you realize that raw seafood is not the way to go here, the cooked versions are way better and quite tasty. It's worth a stop, particularly if you don't have to wait in line too long.",

As we waited and people coming out, they commented it was worth the wait and the couple behind us also said they always come here.

When I called to place my order the lady was extremely irritated and rude to me on the phone acting like I was an annoyance to her putting in a delivery order. She seemed so annoyed with me that I almost hung up and canceled my order because she made me feel so uncomfortable. Then after placing my order she told me it would take about 45 min....not even 5 min later my food was at my hotel. Some people might like that there food was made and delivered so promptly... But there's no way the shrimp creole that I ordered would of been made properly and delivered to me in 5 min, I obviously got late night left overs.... When I opened my meal.. It was a sloppy mess and the sauce was coming out of the sides of the container... It literally looked like someone just scooped some rice and shrimp creole from an old pan and just threw it in a container. I also ordered a side Caesar salad. The lettuce was completely limp. And they gave me a peice of bread to eat with the shrimp creole and it was literally stale and breaking apart I couldn't even kind of consume it.

CMJ_N4vhL1DwtD93FNylAw,"Step 1: wear your stretch pants 
Step 2: wait in line - it's worth it and you can gawk at some tasty looking cupcakes in the shop next door while you wait 
Step 3: order hot chicken - I ordered the mild and wished I would have ordered the medium. It's not as spicy as I expected. 
Step 4: be surprised by the reasonable price! We ordered a basket with two legs and two thighs, two chicken tenders, three sides, two drinks, and extra pickles for $20 
Step 5: hustle to find a spot (or get friendly with people at a table with extra space) and wait some more - it will take a while to get your order, but do not get discouraged - the reward is delicious, juicy, chicken with a pickle or two on top. 

Side notes: The side items are ""meh"" as my fiancée would say (the only reason for the 4-star rating). We got the pimento Mac and cheese, French fries, and greens (our attempt to be healthy). They were all ok, but nothing exceptional. We went on a Sunday when they serve chicken and waffles. They also had grits as a side item. I wish I would have tried both. And if you're a pickle lover like me, order extra pickles - totally worth it. 

The friendly guys sitting next to us ordered the hottest of the hot chicken but decided not to eat it after all. Of course, I didn't turn down the offer to try a bite, and it was exceptionally spicy! My face burned for a good 15 minutes, but the heat in my mouth died down after about five. I would say it's worth a try, but a whole basket would leave you wanting a big glass of milk...and you would probably regret it later (if you know what I mean).

You will not be disappointed in this restaurant and it's on Bourbon street"
CN7olAEeWQ5SeijHm71Oww,,"First stop for our work trip and it was worth the wait.  I had never had char grilled oysters before and needless to say I am now a huge fan.  

The waiting process is very efficient and for the length of the line no one group appeared to wait to long.  After having been in town a few days and waiting in a few lines I can definitely say their system is by far the best.

The restaurant was crowded and it felt a bit cramped, but the food made you forget about it.  Our server was friendly and answered a multitude of questions.

I tried char grilled oysters at almost every restaurant we went to and Acmes were by far the best I had.  Would go back again and again if I leaves closer.",
CN9vl4Yksp2qa8gj3SXe5Q,,,"Stopped here for dinner and there was a short line outside. The food and drinks were all delicious!  BBQ shrimp, red beans and rice, fried shrimp, and bread pudding were all delicious!"
CNC1ji4AS2vG2X340aPf4A,,,"The staff was amazing, super friendly. We had a waiter and trainee. They were helpful and attentive. The food wasn't anything to write home about but it couldve been simply what I got. Id love to go back and give it another try."
CNX3o9YGXzTUpY43dbZJXA,"Hattie B's... a true southern tradition in Nashville.  I've been coming to Nashville for a long time and for some reason or another... just never made it to Hattie's.   The wait in line was fun... everyone was in a good mood... perhaps still slightly drunk from Broadway music last night. The staff was fantastic and efficient.  Moved a lot of diners thru fast without feeling rushed.   The chicken was absolutely ""ok.""   We ordered all different versions... kinda bummed as I was expecting to be wowed.  As far as flavor, texture and over chicken quality... i begrudgingly point you to the Publix deli hot chicken.",,
CNZlDKedYohlwN78tX6XBA,,"Had to wIt 30 minutes or so. Really loud inside and they could do without the blasting music, or at least upgrade the speakers.  All that aside, the food was fabulous. Nothing fancy and no need for that. Just really good fish. I'm not an oyster fan so stuck with the fried fish. Probably the best I've had and will judge all others against. Service was great too! Ask for Mike!",
CNaHLXC45cR07vtDeFYeww,"While taking an Uber from the airport to my hotel I asked my driver if there was any place I needed to check out for lunch the next day.  Without hesitation she said that I should try out Hattie B's as they were famous for ""hot chicken"".  Not being from the south I had no idea what she was talking about but my curiosity was certainly piqued.  

So when I had some free tome from my conference the next day, I went directly to Hattie B's.  I was incredibly shocked to see a long ass line coming out of the front door all the way down the street.  Damn, this place must be good if people lined up like that.

I made friends with some dudes in the line who happened to be in town for the Titans / Bills game.  They were from NY and also had heard about the holy mecca of hot chicken.  

Since I was at the end of the line like a sucker I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted.  You need to pick 1) Which chicken plate you want 2) how hot you want it, and 3) sides.

The intoxicating smell of fried chicken tortured me for the 40 minutes I waited so by the time I got to the front I ordered a too large for me Large Dark Plate which came with 2 thighs and 2 legs.  For heat I went with ""HOT"" which was mid range heat.  Finally for sides I did the mac and collared greens.

When I finally got my food I tore through it like I hadn't eaten in weeks.  The chicken was AMAZING!  It was a piping hot (temperature) greasy, juicy, delight.  I'm glad I got the HOT spiciness as it was just the right amount of kick.  The collared greens were very good and the mac was just OK.

Overall I think this was a great experience although I wouldn't wait in that line again. I would suggest ordering ahead and picking it up if it is very busy.  Anyone who hasn't had Hattie B's definitely needs to experience this Nashville treat!",,
CO1Zcbnr2lluSz_4t8rHAQ,,"So I did the tourist thing this evening and had dinner at ACME. Being as I was a tourist this time, I can say that the oysters were Fantastic! They were HUGE and fresh. Nothing like the puny oysters we get back home.
Big bonus for no detectable grit in any bite that I took. Pretty rare...

I also had the seafood gumbo, which was ok. The shrimp in there were a little on the mushy side, but the flavor was good. 

All-in-all, a great meal. Abita Purple Haze on tap and a dozen raw. The guy next to me had the chargrilled ones which  looked and smelled really good too. Something to try next time.",
CODDQLXErJh_sV_--5UJug,"I have so much ambivalence writing this review. Do I blame myself for ordering the ""damn hot"" fried chicken? Would I have liked it more if I had ordered merely ""hot""? The damn hot was exactly that - super spicy - sort of ghost pepper hot - I really wanted to love this chicken but I only liked it. I got a large dark meat - in fact - a small would have been enough food. So the portions are generous. Based on reviews, I also ordered the fries, greens and black eyed peas salad (imagine a 3 bean salad that is not too sweet). I really liked the fries and the black eyed peas - super good - fries stayed crispy throughout and the peas had a great flavor. The greens were good - homemade but not amazing. But it's supposed to be about the chicken, right? Therefore, the 3 stars... it just wasn't remarkable - good? Definitely. But worth standing in line for a half hour (on a light night) and another good half hour to get the food? Nope. Finally, I ordered the peach cobbler - again, was it bad - absolutely not - but will it go down in the annals of ""best ever cobbler""? Nope. I give this place a solid 3 stars maybe 3.5.",,
COExlPN1HZeNxdRK5QhrnQ,,,Redfish Oceana was amazing. Fyi..the mash potato almost stole the show! I would get the blackened redfish with shrimp on top.
COG0yZUG0eoXOmba-1luUw,"Poppin! Came from New York and this was our first stop. No regrets there, I went with a mild chicken sandwich but I don't think it was hot at all and I could've went up a notch or two. Either way still awesome!",,
COg-2AkWwotBwoBl28Woaw,,,"Fantastic brunch spot! I had the Lost Bread (aka French toast) per the waiter's recommendation, & it was sooo yummy! Hubby had the Country Breakfast which was  just your basic breakfast fare. Fabulous coffee...which was never less than half full thanks to awesome service! Our server Jerry was one of the best we've had. He earned extra points with me for not only being attentive, but whipping out hand sanitizer after taking our menus away."
COvaH0__TEVJ0hkUlPiNHg,,This was my favorite place I ate at on my vacation to New Orleans. The breading on their deep fried dishes was the best I've had. It was not oily and had flavors added into.,"This is just off bourbon street which makes it easy to find and right outside of all the excitement. I got the Louisiana crab meat cakes and the catfish po boy and my girlfriend got the chicken Alfredo. The crab cakes are packed with crab meat and very flavorful. I also tried the black and gold gator tail bites. If you're feeling adventurous, I recommend trying the blackened gator bites.

The catfish po boy was exactly what you would expect for a white fish po boy. The chicken Alfredo had a little kick to the sauce which was a nice Louisiana twist to a very typical meal. 

Overall the ambiance was nice and if you're looking for a place to eat in the French Quarter you may want to give this one a try."
CP7WLe0ACtP2sl5EOU6MlA,Fun place to take out of town friends to introduce them to Nashville's hot chicken! Best sides for a hot chicken restaurant. This location isn't as busy as the midtown. Try the banana pudding - it's great!,,
CPE9s_YOMC6Xqhv_oaRpFA,"So I am in Nashville for a couple of days, a kind elderly gentleman told me I need to get some good southern food. I yelped and decided to get some fried chicken at Hattie. Based on the reviews, it seemed like a must try. I was afraid the line will be long so I placed an order online the night before and pick up by 11:30 the next morning. The ordering online was easy and 11:30am slot was the first available slot. 

Next day, I did a Lyft as I was afraid I won't find parking. The parking right in front is for the cupcakes store beside Hattie. And around me, the spots are for its dedicated restaurants or certain stores only. If you need to drive, check first and perhaps there's parking around. 

I reached around 11:15am and there's a short line of 7 people I front of me. Great! I stood in line not knowing where I should pick up the food. The guy serving behind the counter is polite and helpful and directed me to his right where another guy checked and confirmed my order is 4th in line. I asked to have my meal eat-in instead. If you order online, they will pack it to-go. If you eat-in, you can inform the guy where you'd like to sit, inside or outside and they would deliver the food tray to you. I did not know that beforehand so I stood by the fountain drinks for my food. All's good except it was quite crowded within the store itself; you have people all around you trying to squeeze through to get to their tables or to grab for more sweet tea. Since I was waiting for fried chicken so that excitement keeps me up and positive. 

The arena: I got my tray and went outside to sit by the bar-like high table surrounding the edge of the sitting area. Good view of the long line that formed and started to round up the corner of the store. Not a good idea after a while as you have those standing customers staring at you as you dived into the delicious fried chicken. So choose a seat away from the main door will be good. 

The food: I ordered a small white (medium hot, breast & wing) with two sides (Mac & cheese, potato salad), a piece of tender (hot) and a small banana pudding. I couldn't decide if I should get a big white (two pieces of breast & wing) as I wasn't sure of the size. The food was too much for a big eater Asian gal. So share if you are a normal eater. The fried chicken is awesome. The fried chicken skin is super crispy, well seasoned and good amount of spices. It's not spicy and I can't even eat chopped red chillies. The meat is super tender and moist with meat juices. I enjoyed the fried chicken and will definitely eat it again. The chicken tender was slightly inferior to the chicken/meat in bone. It was still tender but less moist and less flavorful. Meat in bone is usually more flavorful. There's not a lot of bones to deal with if you are having a chicken breast, so try it instead of the tenders if you like white meat. If you are wondering how hot is the hot level; it is hot on the tongue for a minute, it doesn't burn you. The rest, I enjoyed the potato salad, it has a nice sour taste and creamy texture to it. I am alright w the Mac & cheese. The banana pudding gives a sweet ending to my lunch. It's my first time having a banana pudding. It has real banana mashed up, with a good ratio of sponge to fruit and topped with baked meringue. The sponge and meringue balanced the sweetness of the fruit. I enjoyed it quite a bit.",,
CPXM9KFZXhmehO3qk81rCw,,"This was the first place we ate at upon arriving in New Orleans. The wait to get in was definitely something (we arrived on a Friday night) - but the hour or so spent waiting for this was absolutely worth it! We also made some new friends in line. :)

The oysters were succulent and grilled to perfection, with just the right amount of cheese and butter. We also got some etoufee which was the first time I'd ever tried the dish - I went into it not quite knowing what to expect, and immediately fell in love with the dish! This was an amazing place to ease into the local cuisine and I am so glad we came here. This place is definitely not overhyped and I'd highly recommend checking this out!","This was my worst meal during my New Orleans trip. I was so excited to finally try a grilled fish dish, and was so sorely disappointed :( The fish was so dry and hard to eat - the feeling I dislike most is eating for the sake of finishing my food instead of enjoying it (which is what this was unfortunately). My boyfriend got a pasta and that was okay - it was just pretty standard. 

What tops off the cherry on the cake was that this was one of our most expensive meals during the trip! And I'm always for paying for great food, but this was definitely not it. I'm not sure if this is just a one-off experience, but I definitely wouldn't be back. 

The only good part of the meal was that our server (and the others on the team) that were very nice! Would definitely like to commend on on being friendly and attentive."
CPporz6Wpyu7Dr7vt1gfjw,"Excellent spot for hot chicken! I've tried almost every other hot chicken place in Nashville and this is by far the ""nicest"" of the group. I will say that their HOT is not that hot. I'd say that Hattie's hot is equivalent to Princes MEDIUM, although Hattie's offers DAMN HOT and CLUCKING CRAZY hot that I haven't tried. The Mac n cheese was incredible as well. Overall a solid four star experience!",,
CQUDh80m48xnzUkx-X5NAw,,"Oyster House, what do you get oysters of course!

The raw were good and fresh. The baked was eh.  I wasn't impressed it was like oysters rockafeller but tiny oysters and not so amazing cheeses.  

When you arrive here no matter what time of the day expect a wait.  However, they have it organized very well.  The line goes out the door and almost around the corner.  A hostess will come out and ask for your party size and name.  She will organize inside as people leave.  Instead of having total chaos by taking names and letting people leave you just stand there until it is your turn.  It took about 30 minutes for a group of 10 which was pretty good.  When we were seated we meet our waiter.  He took all of our orders without a pen or paper.  I was scared but he was dead on with all the drinks and food.  I had the sampler plate which was a sad letdown.  It had sausage, jumbolaya, and gumbo.  The portions were tiny.  

So up until this point why 4 stars? My friend didn't finish her shrimp etouffee with crawfish tails.  So I took a few scoops of that.  DAMN! That's where it's at.

I had a bad streak of bad ordering on my trip to New Orleans so I don't hold that against the restaurant since the item I tried off a friend was 5 stars.  So overall it all depends on what you order.",
CQcdHRjx_0X3lgMhUuTW7Q,"Waited about an hour, but the Hot Chicken is worth it. Good spice for the Hot style, but not over powering. Right amount of crispiness and still good and juicy. Sides are ok. Staff are all friendly and helpful.

Acme is a great lunch spot and I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",

Other than that the red beans and rice were good along with the jabalaya (my favorite on the plate) and the smoked sausage. I tried some fried shrimp and oysters from other plates on the table and was pleasantly surprised. Both were extremely well fried and full of flavor. 

The atmosphere is chill and laid back. I would definitely recommend coming here, especially if you like oysters.",

Everywhere else in the French quarter didn't or was way too busy. It was actually my first time eating alligator and I really enjoyed it. We got the gator bites half blackened half fried.  We also got some oysters as well that were delicious.  This place is on the dimmer side but customer service was great. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. He also really knew the dishes that they had and gave us a lot of recommendations. He even discussed items that weren't on the menu. Overall I would definitely be back, it's a nice place to chill, eat, and have a few beers."

We vacationed at the french quarter and noticed that this place was packed the night before, so then decided to try it following day when the weather was a little cloudy on a work night. The wait was only a couple of minutes and the let us in.  The place itself was quite big, although the place was quite dark and dingy and had a bar vibe throughout.

The servers were quite nice, although service was a little slow at times, granted they were packed.

I had ordered the red beans and rice with sausage while my girlfriend got an order of the char grilled oysters.  Both were very delicious and amazing, and we only ended up paying 10-15$ per dish.  I would describe each, but you are probably better served by looking at the pictures!

Would definitely come back again if we ever visit New Orleans!",

CV4BMLxPSuC5V92JUfQlsw,"Good Hot Chicken and even better Hot Tenders!

I stopped in with a couple of blokes to check how Mr. Bishop throws down on a Nashville original. I always judge Hot Chicken on my first visit by ordering a mild breast and wing:

The Size: Gigantic
The Crisp: On point
The Heat: The mild is not too wild and full of that awesome flavor we love with Hot Chix
The Wait: 30 minutes
The Poultry: Dry. Bummer.

My buddy ordered a Three Tender Basket just for the three amigos to have a taste:

The Size: Good sized tender
The Crisp: On point, but not as flaky as the breast
The Heat: The mild is not too wild and full of that awesome flavor we love with Hot Chix
The Poultry: Very Moist.....awesome.

The Sides:
Crinkle Cut Fries - right on (the only trucked in side)
Potato Salad - strong on mayo which helped calm the heat
Black Eyed Peas - cold and not so good
Pimento Mac and Cheese - Where's the pimento? Cold, watery, overcooked, and bland

The Sweet Tea - sweet

The Ambience: Nothing fancy and not comfortable...to be expected at HC Shack.

The Parking: they only have 8-9 spots. I parked a good distance away and walked. It was worth it!

Next time, although I am a chicken with bones kind of guy...I will go Tenders all the way!",,

CWB2X2ScozCjuKDLUSSZVQ,"I was in Nashville for business and had to satisfy my craving to try authentic Nashville hot chicken.  We were staying near Vandy, so this location of Hattie B's was less than a mile from the hotel.  Based on the reviews (my fellow Yelpers rarely let me down), my colleagues and I went for an early dinner so we wouldn't have to wait in a long line.  Thankfully it was 5:15 on a Monday and we started third from the cashier.

I had planned my order the night before -- 1/2 chicken ""hot"" with pimento mac and cheese and coleslaw.  As I found out, hot is only the third of 5 heat levels.  Though I am a fan of spicy foods, I agree with the other reviewers that hot is spicy enough.  The flavor of the perfectly fried chicken comes through.  I ordinarily do not order white meat because I find it rather dry.  Here it was very moist.  The dark 1/4 was excellent.  Both had the perfect amount of coating that stayed on the bird from beginning to end.  I am a fan of pimento cheese and loved the mac and cheese.  My colleagues both had hot chicken sandwiches and raved about them over the next two days.

It could be that Prince's is better, but I'll stick with Hattie B's.  I cannot imagine fried chicken tasting better.  It's not just a tourist thing . . . the restaurant was full of locals enjoying a Nashville original.  Go early on an off night.  We had no line and easily got a table.",,

The chicken is lightly breaded, heavily spiced, and quite scrumptious. Not your standard fried chicken by any means, as thick white chicken meat lies right below each sort of crunchy bite. Again though, not worth a crazy wait in line as I feel like I ate at many tastier places during my visits to Nashville.",,

Make sure to try the crawfish boil... It comes by the pound market price. For first timers start off with 2 pounds just in case you end up not liking crawfish.. They are earthy in taste. I liked mine, but some of friends felt they were difficult to peel.",
CXLlfLlptq68iWOVnF5xJA,,,"I would personally go to Copper Monkey Grill right next door and avoid the long lines. Food is better, service is much better and no one works harder behind the bar than V. Don't waste your time in our amazing city on line at Oceana"
CXbcl1x8fbFFRfjGQiQi4w,,,I walked into this place not knowing what to expect..and well I don't regret it...we had crab cakes..and I will say I think they are the best I've had..we also had oysters which I'm not a huge fan of...but this place made me reconsider how i feel about that...I definitely recommend trying this place.
CXcj_3ywFK536mBJ9oemxA,,"The vibe is quite good but I have to say that the food is very disappointing. 
Seafood Gumbo is okay. Quite salty as expected.
Grilled Oyster, I cannot really taste the freshness of oyster. It's covered by excessive fat and salt. 
Fried crawfish tail is great. Crispy and just perfect amount of oil.",
CYGpKqof2UK9VYbJSHcjpQ,,"I'm going to split this review to 2 sections. 

The wait is very long. We waited about 45 minutes for a group of 5 on a Saturday night. 

Their oysters were delicious the raw and chargrilled oysters were both delicious 5/5. The raw ones were fresh and juicy/large while the chargrilled (1/2 a dozen were like $11.99) had a nice buttery and savory flavor. The chargrilled ones could have been cleaned better (got some crunchy bits) but it wasnt a dealbreaker. 

My friends enjoyed the peacemaker poboy as well. 

On the other hand, the sampler and etouffee were a 3/5 (on the smaller side with portions). We felt that the gumbo and jambalaya in the sampler could have been more flavored/seasoned. The sampler was on the small side. I enjoyed the etouffee but felt that the flavors could have been more dynamic as well. 

I'd come back for their oysters for sure!",Wait time was less than 10 mins on a friday night at 10. Service was so lovely and responsive. We ordered the jambalaya fettuccini and the crab cakes. Both were around $20 and good for 2 people to share. The portions are on the smaller side but the food came out fast and hot. The flavors were great. The crabcake was crunchy on the outside with plenty of crab inside. The jambalaya was creamy and rich. Enjoyed it both although a little pricy. Fun looking restaurant that has dim lights and a bar too.
CYJXK7dbPFi0nxV0i3XcRQ,,Food is good. Tried their raw oyster and grilled oyster. I like the raw over the grilled and my hubby was to the opposite. The gumbo is decent. Would recommend it.,
CYeLAdKBk5OR8JFLp0gThA,,"Nothing crazy I wasn't impress and and a little overpriced , super crowded , not comfortable and very laud ,hard to carry a conversation in there , food is good but not out of this world .",
CYj5AqaLWdnzCfFTdTacvg,"Really good chicken, but you already knew that, didn't you! We came once and the line was insane, so we decided to come the next day right when the opened. That was a great plan. It only took about ten minutes of waiting and we all had our chicken and sides. I got the Mac n cheese and fries. They were both really good. I went one spice level up on my chicken and it was pretty spicy for me, so watch your spice levels. Really good food, but I'm not sure I would wait hours for it, so plan ahead :)",,
CYmf0jUcgjeGVIVCc4iGsg,,,"My husband and I were just walking around looking for someplace to eat and we happened to see Oceana Grill.  He was hungry and said ""Let's just go in here."". We ordered the seafood crepe and an omelet (not knowing the size).  They came out and were HUGE!!  The omlet was okay, but the crepe was TO DIE FOR!!!  The Bloody Marys may have been the best we ever tasted!  

We won't ever leave NO without going there!"
CYqu48u1kHLtVcFtxn5Ctw,"When you see the line that wraps around this place you might tend to think that it may not be worth the wait.  You'd be wrong.  I'm not a big fried chicken person but this by far is the best ever.  Very crispy outside and juicy and tender inside.  I got the DAMN HOT and it was.  The dry rub/seasoning on the top got stuck underneath my nails and it was pretty damn hot.  My guy got the medium and said it was a little spicy for him but that it was the best chicken ever.  He loves fried chicken and we try places all over the country when we travel.

You gotta try this place, they don't disappoint.  Well worth the wait!!!  We will be back!",,
CYyOM_Jo3vc9FZICIwW8Yw,"Loved visiting our daughter at Vandy because it always meant another.chance to enjoy Hattie B's.  Mild is even hot, but it is delicious!  Finish with banana pudding, always a treat!",,
CZNFgIX64F0tg739Tdb3FA,,,"Duck tasted like liver (yuck). Gumbo was out of a can (underwhelming, under-spiced, unsalted). Jambalaya was OK. Collard greens were good- that's what the one star is for. Friendly staff tho."
CZNX45_DlV_yZDMRqmIfww,,,"Best breakfast in New Orleans by far! Absolutely delicious. I got the scrambled egg, hash, biscuit and grits. I got a side of toast and coffee as well as a Bloody Mary. My husband had the Cajun fettuccine pasta and char grilled oysters. He said everything he said was absolutely incredible. Our waitress was Fiona and she was on point all throughout our breakfast, sweet and kind and always checking in on us to make sure everything was going well. I couldn't be happier with our experience. We've been here a week; trying a different place every morning and this was by far the best. Stop by and try!"
CZQbBtlivKerTpDFD4nytg,,,"Food was delicious and the service was on point! Friendly and gave great recommendations on food choices! Our server, Chantay was great!"
CZe-KCSkxiP9u4giuCILwg,,,"Great food. My husband had the blackened chicken and loved it. I had the taste of New Orleans and it was pretty good. I wish I would have made another choice, but the red beans and jambalaya were tasty. My daughter loved the creme brûlée. It was her first time trying it and she is now obsessed!"
CZsu94OZGVaN9Jsbvnl4dA,,,"Best crab cakes I have ever had! Definitely worth trying the gator bites too! The place is vibrant, right next to bourbon street and has the New Orleans buzz! Totally worth the visit."
CZwuiEQJnawL2sWg9bGS6A,,"I came here while I was attending an international conference in New Orleans. Before coming to NOLA, my friend and I have heard and read rave reviews about this place, queuing for over half an hour in the summer heat to get into the restaurant was not a problem. Plus, we thought that long lines were only because the entire French Quarter was crowded with conference attendees. We were told afterwards that there is always a line to get into the restaurant lunch and dinner hours, so keep in mind you won't be getting a personalized, highly attentive service here.

I had the fried soft-shell crab and the special sampler (jambalaya, gumbo, and red bean rice). This was my first time trying soft-shell crab that was fried this way, so I had nothing to compare it to but it was definitely full of flavor. I  The jambalaya and gumbo were far from the best I've had in NOLA, but undeniably better than Southern-style dishes I've tried outside NOLA. I regret not having ordered their signature char-grilled oysters! I guess this means I'll have to be back again to try that.

The waitress was very friendly, which was common in NOLA, but also rushed due to all the crowds. Also, my friend and I were sat on the same table as another family; they were on one end and we were on the other, but same table with two seats in between. A lot of other groups were also sat on the same table or connected tables. Some did not even have seats in between - just napkin holders as ""separators."" I'm not sure if this was because they were over capacity, or if it was just the Southern hospitality and their way of making everything more friendly.

I do think it's worth coming here for the experience, but remember not to expect anything fancy or personalized.",
CZzamaiPxlQI9W4d0xB3hA,"I LOVE CHICKEN and this is easily the best fried chicken I have ever had. It was cooked to perfection, the bread they use on the sandwich is great, and the sauce (I had medium heat) was just right. Will be going back!",,
C_IZf0lkgef8oURSImyCYg,My friends and I got there right when they opened on a Sunday and there was already a line. The line went by fast and most people past the time by having a beer or 2. I would say we waited 45 minutes but it's worth it. The chicken was flavorful with the right amount of heat. I really enjoyed Hattie B's and can't wait to go back.,,
C_hUvw2z0R-Rv0yZb6QCZA,,"There always seems to be a line. Got seated at the bar and ordered the raw oysters. Their oysters size seem to be the smallest out of all the oyster places I've visited. Their ""spicy"" cocktail sauce seems like the just added horse radish instead of serving it separately. Their chargrilled oysters must be delicious because the guy next to me ordered another immediately after eating the first chargrilled oyster. This place is packed but staff is nice and friendly. If you don't mind waiting give it a try, however, I didn't feel these oysters stood out from others in the French Quarter.",
C_mFj7_oboONCLZkjecDVg,,,"Very friendly wait staff, and fast service even though this place was quite busy.

Right off bourbon street and still quite a good deal, with minimal D-bags surrounding the bar.

I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the duck. And yes, I would like a softshell crab on top of that! I know they weren't in season, but it was still delicious. Blackened alligator bites were also very good. 

And in true Bourbon street fashion, get your last drink in a to-go cup."
CaFbx2zBXiAUC-JmgsyDnQ,,"I've never been more disrespected in my life, first my cousin and I went to the restroom, well the waitress informs the people in my party they will not serve alcohol to my cousin, then the manager tries to throw us out because we said we needed a table for 5 then my friends boyfriend showed up. After further investigation, he realizes we requested a table for 6 and it was under HIS name, he comes and apologizes to us and blames EVERYTHING on the girl seating people.  I can tell you they were very unprofessional, we ended up spending over $200 in that restaurant.  I will NEVER step foot in there again.",
CaPf4tvu64_haJovAZMaKg,,,"Redfish special was fantastic as was the Hurricane and Fried Eggplant.  The Fried Crawfish Tails were very dry and had the texture of fried clams.  If you don't like parmesan cheese, be sure to ask for Fried Eggplant without parm."

I can eat these for every meal for the rest of my life, this is day 3 here and we went on day 1, have had several other charbroiled oysters and nothing else is even close. Wait in line as long as it takes, you will not be disappointed...",
CatPIDaQebZsz6UsObCurQ,,"The oysters were fine.  The security officer, in my opinion, was acting unprofessionally.  This place would get more stars if it were not for the confrontational and harassing security officer that they keep at the front.  This is not an experience I recommend to anyone.  

On July 19, I was with my family listening to some music across the street, and I decided to get some quick oysters from Acme.  I walked over and saw there was a line, but I wanted to ask a server a couple questions.  

As I approached the door to talk to a server, the security guy in a police uniform barked ""hey, there's a line.""  I asked if that was also the case for the bar and he said yes.  I told him I wanted to talk to a server to ask a couple of questions and he ordered me to get in line.  His tone was way over the top, so I asked him if he was on duty and asked what exactly Acme was paying him for.  He confirmed he was getting paid by Acme and he then said, ""Our conversation is over.""  That is, until the server came out two seconds later and then he barked again ""Hey, why don't you tell this guy what to do so he can get in line?""

I asked three questions and the server answered my questions just fine.

I waited for a little bit, got a seat, sent the security guy a soda to avoid any hard feelings, and got my oysters.  I won't go back; I will always remember this place for the security guard on a power trip.

If you don't like to be treated like a prisoner, I suggest you take your business elsewhere.",
CavYw5dDSpoFuYpss50qAw,,Not much of a gumbo kind of person but the seafood gumbo was very tasty. It was very different from the only other time I tried gumbo at home. The red beans and rice were pretty good as well.,
Cb3iZX-xHco1aqhmJjHcGw,,,"Service was ok. Our waiter seemed to struggle with a large party. Food was brought out staggered so some were eating while others waited. It was closer to the end of the night and the level of service and quality of food suffered as a result of that I believe. However, I had the seafood platter and it was delicious! Even down to the cole slaw. Also had the Hurricane which came out smoking and it was GREAT! I'd recommend the spot but maybe not late night."
Cb40HUPURuMzff9d9BvZ-w,"The staff was so nice and friendly. The service here was great. The food was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best chicken I've ever had. Also, I definitely underestimated the spicy level! I ordered hot since there were two more spicier options above it, but hot was still really spicy! I would pick mild next time.",,
CbaN90oDgulSgSON4lk_pA,"Wow. Visiting from Los Angeles for one night and this place was recommended. Had the chicken tenders medium with ranch, Mac and cheese, pickles, and fries. Everything was fantastic. Make sure to take some bites of the chicken with the pickles and ranch together!",,
Cbd7NJJa7NzS_uZGTiMZ2g,,,"Had a great time eating here twice for dinner and once for brunch while in town for my wedding. Everywhere else for a large table was too busy for the two night time meals and would've never got us back as fast as Oceana Grill! For a party of 17 one night (a Friday) we only had to wait about 20 minutes! They have lots of room downstairs and upstairs and are a quick turnaround crew. They were very sweet and gave me and my fiancé congratulations dessert! We passed around the whole table, it was a bread putting and so good!

My only complaint is that they change the menu for the weekend and the prices increase, and they don't have the same sides available for people to know that they can do ala cart (on that weekend menu).

Very tasty food, they are able to make a vegetarian po boy for my fiancé with eggplant fries- So everyone was happy :-)"

CcLrvLs-FRqo9ub3lC3hnQ,,"We came in the evening so the line wasn't so long waited about 20-25 mins to get a table. I was really excited to eat here with all the great reviews especially since I love oysters. I ordered the famous chargrilled oysters and raw oysters. I have to say the chargrilled were excellent but very disappointed with the raw oysters, they were warm, not served on ice and extremely dirty, my fingers turned. black after grabbing the first oyster. This completely grossed me out and then I looked behind me and I could see the mirror that points towards the oyster and you can see how dirty they are while shucking them, it just felt very unhygienic. I also tried the seafood etouffe and that was really good, I very much enjoyed it. This place could be a lot better if they just made the oysters cleaner. Picture of dirty oyster area with my review.",

This gator sausage was excellent especially in my omelette. But I must say that the food was great but my service was off the charts!!!! If you visit Oceana make sure you ask for Bree......she is one of kind. Made this experience ten times more amazing! Yes I said more amazing  Enjoy Foodies"
CcdAhDwYX7WTQX0OSF1SJQ,,,"Nice little ""dive"" with great food and outstanding service. Our server Jordan was top notch and the Taste of New Orleans plate was perfect. My only critique would be they have a very limited beer selection but I'm a bit of a beer snob."
CcgPkFQqeg6dDJAoY5PQFw,,,"Favorite place in town so far. This was our ""all out"" meal of vaca. Between my boyfriend and I we ordered raw oysters on the half shell, gator bites, blackened catfish with a crawfish sauce on top, and blackened duck also with a crawfish sauce. Both meals came with their signature jambalaya and collard greens. Out of this world. The staff were friendly and service was quick considering the amount of people. We sat on the 2nd floor with a great view of their beautiful coutyard."
Ccv0TwUOlg10EcykK-RkmA,,"This place is definitely worth the wait, and high rankings!  Best crawfish étouffée we've had in town, and the grilled oysters are crazy good!","Fantastic service!  We are here for lunch, shrimp po boy was very good, as were the fried crawfish tails.  Lunch was a four star experience.  So why only 3 stars?  We were told that if we brought our receipt back for dinner we'd get 10% off. So we came back.  Again great service BUT the food tasted like it had been sitting around for a while (first clue should have been that it arrived lightning fast after we ordered, nowhere near enough time to cook it). Food was ok but stale, my wife sent back her redfish because it was so dried out. They also gave us the wrong to go dessert, but honest mistake.  So many great restaurants in this town, I can't really recommend other than for s decent lunch if you are nearby."
Cd4oI8_bsofo9OYDqc-Xjw,,,Recommended by more than one local...we were not disappointed. The service was great and the food was very good. Definitely a place to return during our next visit.
Cd6zsjgvkUwZr2gdPIPgcw,Worth all the hype you have heard about their chicken. Great spices and very juicy chicken. Sides are delicious as well. Line can get a little long but a must stop while in Nashville!,,
CdKQJqAnqKtA5XwWlC1htw,,"Sorry, ACME...I think this placed was so overhyped in my head, so it ended up being a letdown. :( The wait actually wasn't bad (20 min), but we went on a Sunday night at 8pm.

We ended up sitting at the bar, and our shucker basically paid no attention to us for the first half of the meal. He kept forgetting to put some of our orders into the kitchen and bar. I might just be a hater, but they all shuck pretty slowly. I've seen it done much quicker at Captain Tom's, waddup Houston. 

Charbroiled oysters - HUGE freaking oysters. Biggest I've ever seen. Sooo salty though with all the cheese and shiz

Fried peacemaker poboy - meh, I've had better. The tabasco mayo was interesting, though.

Crawfish etouffee - oooomg this was the best thing I had there. The bf kept saying it was too buttery, but I loved it!!! Been watching too much Paula Deen.

I guess this is just one of those things you have to try in NOLA, but I'd probably skip out on it if I ever return..",
CdXtUR_0rXb4H-ePhe9r_g,,,"Whitney was our server and the food and service couldn't have been better. We had the Taste if New Orleans, egg plant sticks, and Cajun fries. A perfect sample of a lot of what they have to offer and very satisfying."
Cdhp80qQ1NlRk8iMxAemmQ,,,Great food and atmosphere. Kind of touristy by location but authentic cuisine is sure to please locals. Amazing deserts. Outdoor and indoor seating.
CdhplOTVbbT5nSnnQkyVwA,,,Had the Oyster Rockefeller for the first time and they were amazing!!  My husband and I  shared the Red Fish with Jambalaya and mushroom cream sauce with crawfish tails. This was one of the best lunch we've had in New Orleans.
CdqIBnH7CYmBJd13Op855A,,"Came in on a very busy night on the first day of Southern Decadence. We were a little nervous that we were not gonna get a seat since we came in at 9pm with lines out the door. We were seated just as quickly as we got there because we were the only small party of 2 and everyone ahead of us were parties of 8 and 12. 

Our server was very attentive despite having to constantly run back and forth around the restaurant to tend to many guests. Never had trouble ordering more food or getting refills on our drinks. 
Tried the boo fries which were very delicious despite being such a simple dish. Then we went ahead and ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters for the first time. My boyfriend does not like seafood at all but he ate a whole dozen and a half of these all by himself. I ate a dozen myself. The oysters themselves were a little small in size though so for that I took off a star. If you call yourself an oyster house they better be the most beautiful large oysters you can source. 

Ordered 2 acme sunsets while we were there. A very delicious cocktail although I doubt how little the alcohol is in the actual beverage. Was able to down the 2 glasses without feeling a thing. Great tasting juice though!",
CdyR_Vg-K0sNPmfnjBRStA,,"If you like oysters you must stop here!! When we got here there was a pretty long line and we were told it would be about 30minutes. Then the people standing behind us told us that they have been for lunch everyday for the past 3 days they were in New Orleans. Needless to say we waited in line to eat lunch and then also came back later for dinner. 

The raw oysters are the best I've ever had. They are plump, clean and almost sweet. The charbroiled oyster are out of this world; still plump but now with the saltiness from the Parmesan cheese. You have to sop up all the extra buttery sauce and cheese on the plate with the handful of bread they give you. Another must is the oyster Rockefeller soup; so creamy and rich with a big juicy fried oyster on top.",

CeGkQXMaequBJP3hm5k_ng,,,The food was actually good! It is located off bourbon so make sure you just leave your house or hotel whenever you place your order to avoid your food being cold. If you bring a friend you can park illegal real quick to pick your food up. I didn't dine in but the takeout was really good and the price wasn't bad at all. I brought two meals for the price is $32.00 and I'm New Orleans that isn't bad. I also order at night when bourbon street is usually poppin so if you go during the day you should be fine. Anyways five stars .... would I go back ? Mmmmhhh we will see

This time around I ordered the small dark plate (as per usual) damn hot with a shut the cluck up tender. My mistake was trying the tender first and quickly realizing I wouldn't be able to feel a thing afterwards. Now I know damn hot is my limit, and also didn't realize the plate didn't come with sides.

The charbroiled oysters had good flavor but were a bit salty, you definitely need to eat the plain bread slices with it (wish I had some butter to put on the bread). The bill added up do to the small portions of food.

The place smelled like an old musty bar.","Spacious restaurant on multiple floors. Be ready to climb some stairs if seated upstairs. We had the crab cakes, jambalaya pasta and the redfish.

Chicken is very good,  batter is not too thick.  Only complaints I have are the sides are meh, I had better Mac n cheese along with greens while there.  I would also suggest going hot if you have any tolerance to heat. The medium was very mild and I consider myself a wuss.

I personally like to go with the hot on the weekdays and the shut the cluck up on the weekends due to the unpredictable result you may or may not experience after eating that fire! The baked beans are sweet which I love others may not but to me they are top notch. The Mac and cheese and cole slaw are close seconds to the beans. This place really knows how to move a crowd thru so if there is a line stand in it proudly...it's worth it! I also like that they have paper towels built right onto the tables so there is no chance you get stuck with no napkins which has been a problem in the past at other hot chicken joints, and the self serve fountain drink machine is wonderful too after a hot chicken chocking incident in the past as well lol.

CjAhx86X9m4HboMLxftItQ,"Not enough great things to say about this place. It took me over two years and several visits to the Nashville area for me to finally make it, and I'm so glad I did. 

This heat on this chicken is as amazing as the crispy-ness and flavor you'd come to expect from good southern cooking. 

Can't wait to be back.",,
CjDHwUI7Jz38XyDKa42ryA,,"On our last afternoon in NOLA, my wife and I just had to go to the institution that is The Acme Oyster house.  (French Quarter location)

I can't really do or say anything that hasn't already been said.  Acme Oyster house is just that good.  

My only advice would be to get there early to avoid lines- I heard that the lunch crowd can be up to an hour wait.  We got there at 10:45am and were immediately greeted, sat, and had drinks in front of us within seconds.  

We had a plane to catch in a few hours and knew we wouldn't eat for at least 5-6 hours-- so we ordered properly:  6 raw oysters, 6 chargrilled oysters and 2 po' boys.  

The oysters were shucked right in front of us, and served ice cold.  A little Tabasco, a squeeze of lemon and a dash of cocktail sauce and I was in heaven.  The chargrilled ones were quickly broiled with garlic, Parmesan cheese and butter on them.  Served with white bread to sop up all the garlicky-buttery overflow.  As good as the chargrilled ones were, I actually preferred the classic style.  

Po boys!  My wife's first.  She got the fried shrimp po boy with all the fixins: lettuce, pickle, mayo.  Outstanding.  I got the ""Fried Peace Maker"", which is allegedly the #4 best sandwich in the USA!  (And it lived up to the Hype!)  it was served on a fluffy and crunchy French-type baguette, filled to the brim with crispy fried oysters and delicately fried shrimp.  Topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles and a Tabasco-infused mayo.  It was every bit as good as it sounds!!  

Acme is the definition of comfort food prepared like a Boss.  Phenomenal food and great service.  Run- don't walk there!!  Can't wait to go back.",
CjII4qAZ0r4g4eWoJIgcig,,,I've eaten here twice - three years apart. Both times the food and service was great. The crab cakes are a must! I took my boyfriend here and made him to try the crab cakes (he usually doesn't like crab cakes) and he loved them. I will return to Oceana just for the crab cakes each time I visit NOLA.
CjJhEzdWQNEKa7grwPRQyg,"Hattie B's!!!!! Wow! Best fried chicken I've ever had. And I don't even like fried chicken! But OMG this chicken is juicy, hearty, and he the best spicy hot seasoning all over it that I've ever tasted. 

So many people in Nashville say ""get the hot chicken!"" And there's several places that serve it. But after continuous questioning of the locals, 9 out of 10 say Hattie B's, so that's where we went. 

Who cares there's a long line, is part of the experience. Don't be scared to go HOT... It's not smothered in hot sauce, it's the seasoning that is Hot. I'm not very good with spicy food, but I split my order between medium chicken and hot chicken, and although both were delicious, I was surprised so realize I could handle the HOT very well, and the flavors were on point! Bravo chef, amazing. 

The extra hot does taste a bit different, you can really feel the heat in the spices. I didn't try clucking hot, everyone in my group was too scared. Lol. 

Also, the pimento Mac n cheese was amazing, the coleslaw was amazing, and the baked beans were amazing!!!  To top it all off, there's several delicious craft beers on tap. 

If you're in Nashville, you GOTTA GET HATTIE B's HOT CHICKEN!! yummmmm!",,

CjVUaf3GA_5tilu4YrQAEw,,First let me say I love all oysters except fresh. I had a dozen chargrilled oysters and was not impressed. I have had much better elsewhere .These were overcooked and over seasoned. My friend had the same issue. The roast beef/debris po boy with cole slaw was really good. I have been there with friends that rave about their fresh oysters which I did not have. Very casual/ fried food menu. Not worth spending 45 minutes in line for.,Good food big portions at a reasonable price. The woodgrilled oysters and crabcakes are the best. Very rich but also very good. This restaurant is always a thursday night tradition first dinner in New Orleans for us . Casual and good
CjzwYUYlusADOU4CtSXYeA,"Hot chicken is pretty good... but it's probably not worth going way out of your way to try one of these places.  There are many great places to eat in Nashville, I'm not sure why you'd need to make this a special trip.  It's basically just friend chicken w/ some cayenne paste/pepper or something.  I dunno.... long waits too.",,
Ck0x5iCLYD-2h0gNfe2oCQ,"I live very close to Hattie B's.  I have taken several clients and friends to Hattie B's.  I would have to say that they are the best chicken in Nashville.

The food was just amazing!!! Everything, from the alligator tail bite appetizer, to the main course of red fish. Just delicious and well cooked food. 

The service was great as well. Very attentive staff. 

Location is right in the French Quarter, near the famous Bourbon street. 


Highly recommended and must visit if you are in the area and a seafood lover."
CkwAmZutnL7nMF1oUWUFoA,,,Bar tender doesn't know how to make a decent drink. First too much ice then doesn't put alcohol in the second one. Then they bitch about us complaining about it. Shit experience
Cl9vk70UwYIQ3NOJRGdKPQ,,"Chargrilled oysters. 

The fresh oysters were fine, but I'm a fan of getting a variety of different oysters and savoring their differences. They had one giant, milky kind with very little brininess. On the other hand, these oysters were excellent chargrilled. 

Other items were good, but not amazing enough to justify the queue that lines the block.",
ClBEaik_YF_5SjtnXIV_WQ,,"Best oysters anywhere!!! Always fresh, cold, and very large size. Delicious cocktail sauce too. We visit every time we come to NOLA!",
ClKS1U82jOn8T5WIuFpnkw,,,This restaurant was so wonderful the last time we went to New Orleans that we remembered it.. and took another group of friends there this time.. the food is always excellent and I love the selections of specials that they have each evening.. this time I had the catfish smothered in a delicious creamy sauce and covered with crawfish tails..to die for :-) one of the things I really love about this place is that they serve dinner late.. I recommend this restaurant to everyone visiting New Orleans
ClNzn9xcTxN_KIvO9iLyJQ,,"If you are in New Orleans, you need make the time to go to Acme. The waiting line is always very long but it is totally worth it.  We tried their char grilled oysters which was awesome and way better than many other places that serve the same dish in the area. It is a must if you make it to Acme. Other dishes were good but not the best. We ordered their boo fries, boudin sausage, gumbo, shrimp ettoufee and oyster shots.",
CllLV_3SQcG6m-oE9JoDFQ,,"Love the convenience of the location since it's right down the street from my boyfriend's in Metairie.

Service is usually good and efficient. The oysters in my opinion are just as good as any oyster hotspot in NOLA. But if you want to go somewhere for a better price, but without location convenience, try The Blind Pelican on St. Charles. Cheaper during happy hour and just as fulfilling. 

I also have ordered the jambalaya which I think is phenomenal. I believe it has chicken & sausage - which is pretty simple but tastes like homemade jambalaya. I usually ask for shrimp on the side. Good combo. 

Everyone must love Acme because every time I'm here there's at LEAST a 10 minute waste. Luckily, their bar almost always has an open spot to either grab a beer or a bite for those with smaller groups, or in a hurry.",
ClqjpJonzLUGrZLtmtYTdg,,,Best place everrrr!! Best seasoning and the music they played was good too lol very friendly happy staff love Oceanas! Bbq shrimp and Cajun fries with gator ( first time trying gator) was amazingggg And my favs!
CmDPkPrHsYcaHrwTr56Dvg,"Went there and had take out for lunch. Heard is was good, but was real nervous about take out! But day meetings made it so. The food was great. We had a dark meat lunch: with banana pudding. My Sister had wings and loved them too. This was arguably the best fried chicken I ever had. And I couldn't even eat there so I'm sure even better there!!",,
CmHGAxhStJ2XCqLKQXlQlQ,,,"I love coming here! I'm from NYC and I take a trip here every year. No complaints about anything on the menu. They have a waiter (Jamal), he is very pleasant and attentive. I request one of his tables always"
CmHpPPiUSqy4gVIeJyF8LQ,,"Had chargrilled oysters at Acme and Felix's. In my opinion Acme was by far the better place. Felix's left me with a an unpleasant grill taste that came up on me all day. Acme was OMG good! These two places are across the street from each other. 
Acme is the real deal if you want to experience this treat!",
CmR9s-2zH20UkmUt5Qwqnw,,"Just sneaks into 4 star range. I prefer Felix's a bit, but Acme has a wider array of food options. Raw oysters are merely decent from my experience. Roast beef po boy and oyster po boy are both quite great. Service is pretty friendly, and has a very nice beer list. Defintely is a decent place to go to with friends or family; would definitely come back.",
CmZ4sCqz5CROg0evXHaENw,,"Was disappointed to find that they ran out of chargrilled  oyster, but the delicious fried alligator made up for it. 
The wait wasn't very long at all. The food arrived quickly and the drinks were both a 5 star for me!
Loved everything about the visit! I hope next time they don't run out of the oyster because I would've loved to try them out",
CmZFVQhLg9Eu1v_YehSkYw,,,Amazing food and service. They were well organized and everyone said hello and greeted us! Everyone in my party of 8 raved about their food for days!
CmjQyDQImnlhXROkVOrhPw,"As an example of decent fried chicken, I'd have to give it four stars. For the price... that's why it's not 5. A half chicken is $13 and it really is just two pieces, the front quarter and back quarter. 
I didn't get any heat but a friend thought the mild was still a touch too much. 

Most important key--order it online and walk past all the people waiting in the sun, glaring at you for doing such an ingenious move and jealous that they didn't think of something so obvious. Eat it at your office, at home, at the park, at the hotel... no need to sweat it out at the restaurant.",,
CmtZvfoiyih-MSasTKpqmg,"The line may be long, but it's worth it!! Hang in there for the best hot chicken in Nashville!! Be sure to get some sides too, they are delicious!!!",,
CmwXQBjhqxnuGmZMgmdPdw,,,I've been traveling to New Orleans for 26 years and walking by this place. Glad I finally stopped in. Seafood omelette was delicious. My only suggestion is it be served with grits or a choice of grits or hash browns. Bloody Mary was tasty and service was very friendly.
CnQru3rAjmDEIjsQFgF1Ig,,,"At the suggestion of family members who ate here a few months earlier I decided to patronize this restaurant while visiting NO.  
The  food is ok contrary to the rave reviews posted on Yelp. 
I had the crab cake appetizer. The crab cakes were warm although the plate it was served on was extremely hot. 
My friend ordered the gumbo at the suggestion of the waitress. Gumbo was a huge disappointment. Gumbo was not eaten. 
For the entree I ordered the crawfish étouffée with fried crawfish tails. Again the food was served warm and there was an odd taste. Most of this dish was uneaten. 
Truly disappointing meal."
CnSkiqatbrNDhB5XX5HfCg,,,"Hmmmm yum yum yum! Great place to eat in the French quarter! Tasty, fresh seafood, great staff, but BE SUrE your whole party is there or they will make you wait!"
CnUlrMH800HkR--r3zn9MA,"The wait is cluckin' worth it!! I literally have been craving Hattie B's chicken ever since I left! Visiting family in North Carolina, my Aunt, Uncle & I took a trip to Nashville as we've never been. Before I hopped on my flight to Raleigh, I was reading Travel + Leisure which just so happened to showcase Hattie B's as one of the best restaurants to eat at. SOLD!

Yes, you will more than likely have to wait like we did BUT it's totally worth it. The chicken is flavorful & tastes like real southern comfort food. I got the pimento mac & cheese & baked beans for my sides - couldn't keep my fork down! This is a 'must eat at' on your Nashville  vacation!!",,
CnZuaNRWToawY7CL3c3NtQ,"So I will start with if you are not open to waiting in line this might not be the place for you, as we came on a Monday afternoon and the wait was around 30 minutes. However, once we ordered the food came out really quick! 
Besides the line this place is awesome!! I got the fried chicken sandwich and got the chicken hot, which was the third spiciest option. It had a good kick but did not overpower the flavor of the sandwich which is important to me. For a side I got the pimento Mac and cheese which I was also very impressed with. I really enjoyed the pimento flavor which is something I am not super familiar with being from the west coast. Overall, I would most definitely recommend this place as the prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious!!",,
CnjK0VmUTzF-zPEM6QGvpQ,,,"For a great casual seafood feast give this place a try. The shrimp platter was about 20 HUGE shrimp, nicely seasoned fries, hush puppies and really yummy coleslaw-$16! Two in our party had the crab cake burger and they loved it. Also quite the large portion for $10. So many spots in the quarter are all show no go, and this place is a great value. I would be interested in trying some of their pasta dishes. I saw one go by and it looked lovely. The best food in the quarter? Probably not, but the best value I can guarantee you that!! Nicely decorated and clean bathrooms also. If you've spent anytime in the quarter you would know why that is noteworthy! I will go back for sure!"
CoOapqZ3aAZGt7P7qT4y-Q,,,"Was recommended this place by our hotel on our first night here. They have a sampler platter where you can try etouffe (soup), jumbo, and red beans and rice all at once. Their oyster Rockefeller was good, not the best I've had (other places will offer garlic bread with butter to eat with the oysters, at Oceana you just get a couple plain bread slices) but still respectable. The cocktails were great, I loved the Ragin Cajun Bloody Mary!! Would definitely recommend to those who want to try several NOLA staples at once, since they offer several sample platter options."
CoULkkk4RQ2q5yfT6ULdCw,,,Went here the first time because I had a coupon from my cab but it was great.  I've been back many times since.  The crawfish omelet is great.  Can't speak for anything else because I have ordered it every visit.
CoYwLNgMNzviYwQ_7tcUcA,,"LOVEEEE LOVEEE acme!! I was seated quickly and waited on promptly by my handsome and great waiter Clay!!!! He was awesome! The service was great, hospitality was just the way it should have been like Nola is known for and the atmosphere was omg wonderful!! Acne is very family friendly!! My food was delicious, I love my southern Cajun food and I tried the Étouffée melting bowl that Clay suggested (made spicy for me) and IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! ""Thank You Clay!! """"",
CojvDL3mNijk0uZJf1B4EQ,,,Excellent atmosphere. Our waitress Megan was fabulous. Food delicious!
Cp10iqqbOWOmzgW-EmrmaA,,,"Stumbled onto this place after leaving the mango daiquiri place below on the corner. Firstly I was surprised how big it is. Consisting of a few levels.  We were greeted and seated on the 2nd Level right away.  The server recommended their Cadillac margarita which I tried and was pleased with. They didn't hold back on the liquor! I ordered the Cajun pasta for lunch which came with shrimp and alligator sausage.  It was good, the noodles cooked evenly and the sauce was just enough. Let me add that they layer that thang with tons of shrimp and sausage so you will leave full. Garlic bread was just okay and nothing special but all and all it's a place I'd visit again."
CpF7DFGTijUDIEwHVFmJYQ,,,"Me and my girlfriends ate here 2 days ago during the Essence Festival and it was AMAZING!!! I had shrimp poboy and seafood gumbo which was delicious. The poboy had slaw on it instead of lettuce which was so so so good and the gumbo was FULL of chunks of seafood!! Not to mention the fries was delicious.  The only bad thing I can say is the water is horrible and it was a bit pricey for what you get. It's so many more places in NO with authentic creole food with cheaper prices. It's not an elegant place but there prices would make you think so. 

The line.... Please don't be fooled by that long line, I think they intentionally do that to make people curious about the food and eager to eat there. Trust me it won't take long at all it was about 20 -25 people in front of us and me and my sister walked around the corner my girlfriend called us in 10 min and said hurry up come back is only 4 people in front of her now."
CpM970FoZVTX_JGZqe2QaQ,,,"This place is nothing but the truth! Located right in the French Quarter's.  We stopped in for a late afternoon lunch. We were greeted and seated right away. We didn't have reservations.  The staff was so nice and polite. They even opened the door for you.
Our server name was Marlon. He was so nice and checked on us regularly. He gave us some drink recommendations. I went with the Ocean-tini. Which is like an Apple Martini with a splash of Midori. Btw Midori is melon. 
That drink was good and not watered down
Like some of the others I've tried since I've been here. Now on to the Appetizer. We shared 
The Cajun Alligator Sausage. I love trying something new and that was Delicious!
I had the Fried Seafood Platter. Added on the Softshell crab for an additional price. It did not  disappoint me. My husband had the Blackened Bayou Duck. It was topped with a Crawfish mushroom sauce. When they you will be back for this treat. You sure will. I plan on ordering that the next time we return. 
We had window seating that was perfect! 
We plan on returning. Ask for window seating if you have a party of Two. I can't comment on desert as l was so overwhelmed from the seafood but it's all good!  Definitely on my next  visit."
Cq1KuFVWv5MSL22t4sk1Jg,,Not a seafood person AT ALL! But my husband is so we tried it out. You will not be disappointed! Food is AMAZING and customer service is even better!!! Most definitely will be a must stop when we visit NOLA every year!,
Cq6DKlVEugHaH1u90AYPZg,"We went today (Sunday) because our hotel is right across the street. We knew we had big dinner plans at 7pm but this was our only real chance to try Hattie Bs before heading home. Got in the already long line at 11:30am and finally ordered our food a little bit after 1pm, which we expected. The wife and I split the large white meat chicken, hot (which was the middle spice) option. They even put each half on a separate plate for us. Our sides were the bacon cheese grits (Sundays only) and the pimento mac n cheese. To start, let me say that they had staff outside the line to take your drink orders while you waited to head inside! Amazing. After ordering, your food got to your table within fifteen minutes. We only planned on a taste so we would still have an appetite for dinner later. The chicken was steaming hot, juicy, spicy and delicioso! We had to force ourselves not to eat it all for two reasons: the big dinner later, plus we have a microwave in our room to reheat it later on or the next day. Though the sides were nowhere near warm enough, we did not care because we knew we could heat them up again in the next day or two. The staff were always smiling and helpful to new-comers; prices more than fair; plus we did not feel rushed out the door once we were finished eating. Though I have heard this might have been a tourist trap, I wish I was swindled this way on every clucking vacation. Next time I will get the even-spicier chicken option.",,
Cq7eJe3ghqCisTxjDk2uwg,,This is the only place that we ate at twice while in New Orleans. The wait outside was not quite as long as it looked either time. We ate at the bar on the first trip and enjoyed watching the man shuck the oysters. We both had Po Boys on that trip and they were outstanding. On our second trip we went with the chargrilled oysters and were happy with our order. Stop here and enjoy the seafood. Don't let the line scare you.  Their is a good reason for the long lines. Its good food and service.,
CqHfl-6xwZrr89lbJJhU5A,,"Totally lives up to the hype! Delicious oysters and po boys. I recommend getting the charbroiled oysters, they are smothered in garlic butter and come with bread.

Delicious food and nice staff!",
Cqmn-IdPB2XS44GsUvaa6Q,"Very flavorful and juicy chicken. But I regret underestimating and choosing their highest ""Shut the Cluck up"", and I am an Indian guy who enjoys super spicy Indian curries that most non-Indians can't handle. Will try at least one spice level below next time. Also, as many others have pointed out here, the parking is messy and the lines are long; I had placed a to go order online, and that saved a lot of trouble.",,
Cr5k9Iq6GC5V4bfHKNt-fA,,"BOMB, BOMB and did I say BOMB!!!! Being from the West Coast it is difficult to find a good Po'boy and Louisiana styled seafood. I don't know where to begin with this place. First, please do not get scared by the line outside the door (it moves fast). Second, staff was very friendly and inviting. Okay, now for the food. Charbroiled oysters (drool), Oyster/Shrimp Po'boy (drool), Seafood Gumbo, as Homer would so eloquently put it (ahhhhhhhh, with some drool dribbling down his mouth). To top it off they had Yeungling by the pitcher!!!! I will admit, this may not be the most authentic seafood New Orleans has to offer but it is a fabulous introduction.",
CrOSQAyOPR12PRXBkdwgfA,,"I visited once on a trip to NOLA with friends. When we asked the locals where to eat, Acme came up more than once. So of course we had to check it out. When we arrived, there was a line outside and we were told it'd be 25-30 minutes but we were seated in less than that. We almost decided to go somewhere else, but boy I'm glad we didn't.

As you've already read in the other reviews - Get the char grilled oysters! You won't regret it. The crawfish etouffee is also amazing, as are the staff. I will definitely return if I'm ever back in NOLA.",
CrQvCpC7BOsvk_3f0HR8DQ,"A fondness and slight familiarity with ""Nashville Hot"" fried chicken brought us to Hattie B's Chicken (original location) during a weekend stop in Nashville. 

Overall, a tasty chicken spot. Here's a quick primer of our visit:

(1) parking is expensive - prepare to pay over $10 to park relatively nearby.
(2) there will be a line - we arrived about 20 minutes before opening at 11am on a Sunday, and it took us about 30 minutes to get inside once opened.
(3) the chicken can get HOT (flavor) - generous portions, but ask for your flavor(s) wisely.
(4) seating is limited, but we scored the last open table we saw. Be swift, nimble, and ninja-esque to grab one yourself.
(5) We dined on the tenders, exclusively, but the pricing was solid.
(6) Great sweet tea, bad coleslaw. The former was amazing, the latter might have been the worst I've ever had. Might have been a poorly prepared batch, but it was very disappointing.

Now you know. Worth it? Definitely once. You can decide from there.

*** Line tip: order ahead for to-go or carry-out, and they let you skip the line and even jump to a table if you decide to stay. Pretty slick!",,
Crckttv12lhD2KrHy9Khyw,"Never had hot chicken before.  I'm addicted  now.  Don't be surprised if there is a line out front.   This place is worth the wait. Best time to go is around 4:00 pm.  

Everything is good here.  We had medium Heat is plenty hot.  Peach cobbler is a must.  
Prices are reasonable for the quality and portions!",,
CroLKvkWdR7pm2_4OusTgA,"The fried chicken was excellent. While we did have to wait 30 minutes for our food to arrive at our table, it was well worth the wait. The ""hot"" has a good kick, but I was honestly expecting it to be hotter, so next time I will be going up in heat. 

The Mac & Cheese was incredible! It had chunks of pimentos that complimented the noodles and cheese. It was by far my favorite side item. The potato salad was also very good, with bits of potato skins, along with potato chunks.

The portions are HUGE! Both my wife and I could have shared a plate and sides. Be prepared for long wait times as the line was consistently outside the door the entire time we were there.

Lastly, prepare to pay for parking to eat here. They have a few spaces reserved for the restaurant, but those fill up very quickly. Its also on a busy street so getting in & out can be a challenge too. 

We really enjoyed this and will be returning!",,

Once we got in the food came in less than 10 minutes after we placed my order. We ordered the seafood gumbo, seafood étouffe, and the chargrilled grilled oysters. The étouffe was delicious and gave a great reference for southern seasoning. Not to mention, every spoonful was balanced with shrimp, crawfish, and rice. The gumbo was super dope and could only be enhanced by making it a larger serving.  Not only was the food awesome, but the staff was sweet, understanding and efficient at meeting our needs and even gave great bar suggestions for the quarter.

A friend recommended and so glad he did. 

It all started with us walking up to a long line which surprisingly only took 20 minutes. The food and drink are worth waiting far longer if need be. TRUST ME! 

Once seated we started things off with a couple drinks and the alligator tail bites. Yes...I ate deep friend alligator and loved it. They marinate the alligator in Italian dressing for 24 hours so it's not rubbery or gristly either. The sauce they bring for dipping is also delicious. 

For drinks we had: 
""Oceana's Big Banana"" a bananas fosters ice cream cake blended with Bacardi Rum, Stoli Vanilla Vodka and Bols Banana liqueur and the ""Tropical Storm"" a Malibu Coconut Rum, Hpnotiq Liguor, Bols Blue Curacao and pineapple juice and it had dry ice in it so it arrived smoking it was so cool. 

For dinner we had the fried shrimp platter with crawfish tails (the jalapeño hushpuppies were awesome)and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Both were so delicious and flavorful. I added spicy crawfish tails to my pasta too. So good! 

Every moment at this place was the boom! The hostess, server, food runner, bartender, food, drink and company was perfect!

We had a long snowy morning in NYC and ended up missing our connection here.  So what else is better than finding something delicious to eat?  We stumbled upon Hattie B's, and we were not disappointed.  The staff here were nice and friendly, the crowd.. not so much.  People kept staring, for whatever reason.. however, it did not bother me at all.  We had the following:

1/2 Bird (Breast, Thigh, Leg & Wing) - I got this in Hot spicy level, I felt like it had a good heat to it, not too spicy for me.  The chicken was really juicy and flavorful.  I was really surprised how fast the chicken came out, but it was nice and fresh!

Pimento Mac & Cheese - the mac and cheese was awesome!  Very velvety and flavorful!

Baked Beans - baked beans were also delicious!

Red Skin Potato Salad -  did not care for this much, or maybe because the mac and cheese was just so delicious, that this did not meet par!

When in town, I would suggest to come try some Nashville Hot Chicken!  Even if you have a layover, it's only a little over 10 Miles from the airport!",,
CumJftTcNhqpO4eAjEosCQ,,,Oceania is right in Bourbon Street. It's delicious! The service is fast and the servers are nice. The food tastes fresh and delicious. Drinks were also nice and stiff. The only Hangul for me was that you come out of there smelling like fried food even when you don't order it. ‍
Cv2CEc-6BdYYTmsJVTdLKw,,"Was only in New Orleans for less than 48 hours, but knew I had to hit up Acme.  Just grabbed a Bloody Mary and a dozen oysters.  Got my BM spicy, and it was excellent.  I sat at the bar so I chatted it up with the guys as they shucked my oysters right in front of me.  Probably the best raw Oysters I've ever had.  Super friendly staff. Definitely recommend.",
CvG59bl0XSjK_6OhADbSNA,"I ordered three tenders medium heat with mac and cheese and potato salad. Boy was it delicious! It's  worth the 45 minute wait. Really cute atmosphere too! Hand squeezed lemonade was delicious. Only downside is the chicken I was served was luke warm (temperature wise, not the spice.) I guess they make batches of the tenders and let them sit under a warmer til they're served. But it didn't alter the flavor which is all I care about!",,
CvNqU4g89Y-HSbPiMMj1_g,,"I've lived in NOLA for over a year now and have not found a poboy I would voluntarily eat again. It all changed at Acme Oyster House. Their 10-napkin poboy was simple but delicious: roast beef with lots of jus and debris. It had just the right amount of saltiness and the roast beef was shredded which allowed more surface area to hold the delicious juices. 

We also had the char grilled oysters which were delicious -- buttery, cheesy, salty, garlic-y. And of course the bread had the right sponginess to absorb the amounts of leftover butter sauce from the plate (very crucial). We also ordered the boo fries but those were only OK -- the fries were not crispy and the cheese was not melted when it got to our table. But the jus and debris on top were delicious (same as the poboy's I think).

Great atmosphere: they don't take reservations which I think resembles the chaotic and jovial attitude of the place. We stood in line for 20 minutes but it was worth it!",
CvW4CJsyPRjB0q6nvDH4nQ,Wow! So good that I was crying from the heat but. Could. Not. Stop. Eating. So good that my father-in-law put Hattie B's sticker on his truck. Now that's a serious testament!,,
CveaC8QXi5Toje4Cay-3Ng,,"I don't really have much to say about this place other than...it was A-OK.  Nothing brilliant, nothing terrible...

We ordered the charbroiled oysters (of course) and the seafood gumbo.  Both were good, but not spectacular and perhaps that's more because I'm not really a huge fan of either normally.  Definitely on the expensive side, and we sat at the bar and got to watch people shucking oysters.",
Cvi8nZTwDVaQkqmmgQwQMw,"The wait is worth it!! We got a ton of food here for about $8 per person. I was full for hours afterwards, yet still somehow craving more. Loved the dark meat with the medium spicyness - I could have gone spicier but didn't want to burn my insides. Overall, this was possibly the best fried chicken I've ever had...there, I said it.",,
CvmXuFe1JiYAhIbWpIysTg,"This was the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life!

Definitely worth the wait in the line that was out the door.

Was lucky to be there on a Sunday, so I ordered the chicken in waffles.  It was also the best waffle I've ever had.  The cheddar bacon grits- amazing as well!

Staff was super friendly as well.

TIP.. when you get an oyster shooter give it a little stir before you down it to get all the goodies off the bottom.. GO HERE",

Cw8gWwSqTXu1cdxFhXlTBQ,,,"The food was good, I would rate 4. The service not so good, I would rate 2. We had the blackened redfish etouffee, salads and drinks. Prices are reasonable for French quarter. Server was impersonal and kept us waiting to pay the bill. Red Fish Grill was much better."
CwCCfA5rPfjgD_SMazbr3g,,,"The wait staff when you walk in is super nice , friendly and welcoming.

We were a party of 15 so there were a lot of us to seat and accommodate. The food is a hit or miss , some of the the items we had were really delicious such as the bbq shrimp , gator bites ( fried) and sautéed and then the strawberry cheesecake was to die for.

The fried fish and shrimp could have used some more seasoning but it wasn't horrible. The drinks are very strong and priced at a decent price . 

Our waitress took a long time to check us out and the manager had to get involved to help her speed up the process. The music is very calming, so calming that it out most of our table to sleep , because as soon as they left they all wanted to go home :-(. I would strongly recommend to maybe have some more lovely music , after all you are located on 1 of the most lively streets in the USA"
CwL_9fYhtjafY0POccmy-w,,Excellent. You will wait but it's worth it. Best chargrilled oysters I've had (I've had a few) everything I've gotten here has been wonderful. Get ready to fork over some moneyzz. Fun facts: I found a pearl in the oyster in my oyster shooter at this place!,
CwP0ICdKO_T_64-ClM7q9A,,Not much to say here. The chargrilled oysters are the best in the city. Everything else was excellent too. You can't go wrong here.,"Meh....it's ok. The food itself is just average. Our service was terrible. Reddish filet portion was above average. Everything else, not so much. Took an hour and 20 minutes to get our entrees on a slow night. Spend your money elsewhere. Too many other choices for cheaper that crush this place."

CxOmXOfgkYaRcMnmthKcGA,,"I've been here so many times...I think it's time for a review!  Every time I come to NOLA it's a tradition to eat at Acme.  I've tried many things on the menu and everything is wonderful.  No matter where you sit, you can't complain about the service.  Everyone is very attentive and nice.  There's usually a line but the wait is worth it.  If you have to wait, go pick up a beer and drink while you wait in line.   

If you want oysters this is the place to go.  I usually get a dozen raw oysters (FRESH), a dozen chargrilled oysters (AWESOME garlic melted butter and parmesan cheese grilled on the oysters),  BOO Fries (YUM...not sure if it's on the menu fries topped with their roast beef sauce and cheese), the Peace Maker Po Boy (DELISH...half fried oysters and half fried shrimp), cup of gumbo (GOOD...sometimes the rice is under done), and more ice cold beers.  Who doesn't love GO CUPS?!?!  Love NOLA...it's legal to drink on the streets!",
CxZGslegGPJduVdZKQJuqQ,,Just come for the oysters. I ordered a half shell of chargrilled oysters and the half and half fish/shrimp plate. The oysters themselves are quite filling if you are the only one eating the plate. The fish and shrimp platter looked and tasted like it was more breading than seafood. I wish I gotten a full order of oysters instead.,

I found and sat a table that could fit my party while my party was close to order. A man and his wife wanted to sit at the table I was at and I told him how many I had plus a wheelchair.

The sides are great too being able to pick two separate sides with the platter. 
If you go to Nashville, YOU MUST GO TO HATTIE B'S. Like literally, you would totally be missing out if you didn't. 
By the way the lines are usually out the door so try to go on off hours when the lines aren't so bad but they are totally worth the wait of 30 minutes to an hour of waiting.",,
Cye1fDlmni6DepktlUi33w,,,Came with my friends for brunch. The restaurant has multiple floors. Great for large groups. We had people that ordered breakfast items and people that ordered lunch options. I got the taste of New Orleans and a side of soft shell crab. It was so good! I definitely recommend both items if you want a variety of flavors. The fries were amazing. My friends enjoyed the grill oysters. My friends that had the omelettes said they were okay.

CzMp7IX0vQ1q5cWiYrsy4A,Friendliness is a selling point for me when I go to places and this place has the sweetest staff. And if you want fried chicken that you dream about for days this is the place to be. Their Mac and cheese has the right amount of spice and if I was in town longer I would come back again!,,
CzOvhh_j5FTeL0Y19zTI9w,,,Fabulous food and atmosphere. Blackened Catfish stuffed with Crab and Crawfish on top of Jambalaya - Oh My Gosh that was GOOD!  Ask for Chris - he was an exceptional server. Prices were moderate and well worth the food and service we received.  We were very happy we went.
CzQHJTrAStm9h9XVsxC0AQ,,,"First official meal in New Orleans, and it was fantastic!  I had the shrimp po boy, and my husband had blackened redfish with red beans and rice/mustard greens.  Everything was piping hot and very tasty.  The shrimp was fried to perfection, and the fries were perfectly crispy.  The sauce/slaw on the sandwich complemented everything.  My husband's mustard greens were so good - he liked them and generally that's not his favorite.  Their Bloody Marys were tasty too!  Great food and wonderful service - I would highly recommend this spot."
CzZHxhRePTT3ZzFIkaW9XQ,"We waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for the 11 am Sunday opening, fortunately the weather was beautiful and we chatted with a couple of Miami U students which helped pass the time.  We had the 2 piece dark meat, greens and potato salad.  The place was packed so we walked back to our hotel and ate in the lounge area.  Good thing there were lots of napkins available because this chicken is so juicy and delicious.  We got the next to the hottest choice and it was just right for us.  Potato salad was also good, I think we make better greens in the Carolinas, they were ok.  I would go again, and look for a location with a shorter line.",,
D-GnUxXxX3Cn-pdx5GL0rw,,,Stopped in for lunch. What a pleasant surprise. We ordered the shrimp platter with rice and red beans. The service was great and the food was out of this world.   Thank you!!
D-P92irH-MDyq7OYBxWreA,,"I've been here several times, but had
an interesting experience yesterday that I wanted to share. There's always a line, which I guess I'd expect with the amount of marketing they do. Honestly, it's good but why anyone would wait in line for an hour for oysters when there's 10 oyster bars within a two-block radius is beyond me.

We ordered:
*2 dozen chargrilled oysters ($19.99 dozen) 
*craw balls app ($7)
*1x beer 

Totals was around $55 but we spent an extra $20 tipping the oyster shuckers at the raw bar for being kind human beings and here's why:

I brought a friend from out of town and Acme was her very first NOLA food experience (she had heard about it and very excitedly needed to go). 

Issue #1:
We get in line and the hostess walks right past us and skips putting our name on the list. We had to stop and tell her the third time she passed - which was interesting because she asked the person directly in front of us and the person directly behind us both other times. Overlooked that, c'est la vie.

Issue #2:
She told me it would be a 30-minute wait and I should grab a drink so I said ""Good idea!"" and went off in search of libations. I returned moments later with two expensive daiquiris ($25 worth, not something I'd ever normally spend my $$ on but I was entertaining a guest) -- ten seconds later, our name was called (this was about four-five minutes after she told me 30 minutes. 
Excitedly, we walked in and sat down at the bar with our daiquiris and a waitress/hostess immediately and rudely walks up and says ""no outside drinks!"" Our immediate response is that we didn't want to waste the $25 nor spend more time in line, so we looked like two deer caught in headlights. She said it loud, two more times, meaner and more demanding each time. The oyster shucker looked at us, took pity, and grabbed our drinks, placing them under the bar out of sight then telling her we're all set. She proceeded to bitch out her KIND coworkers in front of us for doing this which was entirely unacceptable. She then treated us like we had done something wrong when we even offered to throw them out because we wanted to stay and the nice shucker said not to worry about it. He told his manager who also seemed fine with it --- anyway, I'm just pissy because my friend's very first Nola food experience was a bitchy hostess. One employee told me I had time to grab a drink, so I did. Then I got bitched at for having said drinks.  The three guys behind the bar were great and kind --- which was much appreciated. 

Issue #3: 
I eat chargrilled oysters a lot. I've never had them so salty as these. They're better at the little dive bar, MRB, on St. Phillip, and for $3 cheaper per dozen with a much nicer staff 
...and no wait. 

I had hoped this would be a great experience, and I was really disappointed that it wasn't even a good one. Not only
am I local, but I work in the tourism industry and tell tourists to go here constantly - or at least I used to.",
D-_hQztnH2ozXeeOGnBSDg,,,"Great place for drinks and food!
Coming for out of town we always have to go to Oceana grill to get the appetizer crab dish so delicious. 
They last time we were in NOLA Oceana had all three floor open just the downstairs was open at lunch but still a lot of room.
We sat at the bar to eat the bartender was very nice and efficient."

They started seating people at the back of the line who had larger groups. None of us thought that was fair. I don't think I have ever been somewhere and they seat people who got there after you. 
I ordered the New Orleans Melody. The jambalaya was awesome and so was the grilled smoked sausage. I would totally eat that again. The red beans and rice was good, but it just tasted normal. The gumbo was okay,not my fav, but it served its purpose. 
My husband ordered the fried stuffed crab platter. I didn't try it but he said it was really good. He got a side of fries and hush puppies. The hush puppies were awesome. Nice and fried. 
Not a bad place to eat, just super crowded.",

The staff was friendly and attentive even with the restaurant being fairly busy.  I hear this place gets super busy so if you're not into long wait times, check Google for best times to go.

There were four  of us dining and we all enjoyed the food we ordered. Even dessert was fantastic. Our drinks were refilled promptly and the food arrived quickly. Would definitely go there again."
D1FeVw9U_00mk-L1J_rcJA,"This was my first time trying Hattie B's and it definitely exceeded my high expectations. It was a little after it opened around 11a on a Monday morning and there was already a line out the door which I hear is not unusual. The line went quickly and they even had a water jug outside for a quick cup of water while you wait.

The menu is posted on the door for you to look at while out in line and the menu is also really big behind the counter for easy viewing purposes.

I ended up getting a small dark plate (thigh and breast meat) with a side of pimento mac-n-cheese as well as crinkle cut fries. I chose a medium heat level for the chicken. Overall, I feel like I handle spiciness well but I never ever go for the spiciest level of things. Even at a medium spice level, the chicken was pretty spicy so I recommend going down a level than you're used to because if it's too spicey it could really ruin your food savoring experience. My side's were amazing and I did have some of their homemade lemonade which was pretty sweet.

Service was fast, parking is a little tricky since there is a reaaally small personal lot, out front street parking is sparse, and nearby parking you can expect to pay (for 3 hours I payed  $16!). Additionally, you can only grab a table after your food order is placed and seating is a little limited but it looked like everyone still found a seat in the end.",,
D1eYNoW25rsEzvW_WnANkw,"Recently visited Hattie B's during my trip to Nashville. Everyone kept talking about hot chicken and said this was the best place to go. I'm not a huge fan of fried foods, as I tend to eat very healthy, but this was absolutely delicious. I got the tenders meal to try the different levels of hot. I went with mild, medium and hot. I'm not good with spicy so I figured I'd start low. Mild and medium were easy to handle. Hot is where I started to feel the heat. The chicken was super juicy and not at all dry. I highly recommend getting the Mac and cheese for a side along with potato salad and cole slaw. Delicious experience!",,
D20_F_mykozJW7IpRHWMDQ,Locals kept asking if we tried this place so you know it had to be good. Line was long but moved fairly quickly. Chicken was delicious and so was the lemonade.,,

Mild flavor still gives a tiny bit of heat if you're not a super big heat fan, but still want a kick.  Medium made my husbands face bright red even though he LOVES heat. Only go HOT or greater if you can put down a ghost pepper without a flinch... we all had trouble with the extra wings we ordered.  I think my lips are still tingling.",,

We got seated right away and service was super friendly and quick.

The chargrilled oysters were super delicious and it was my first time trying it in that preparation. Even my husband who is not an oyster fan enjoyed it. The sandwich and etouffe were very good but maybe just a hint too salty. I did have two super delicious bloody marys to wash it down with so I didn't mind at all. Finally the pecan pie with ice cream was divine. A wonderfully sweet finish to a great meal. My favorite meal of my 48 hours here for sure!",
D2WQXu98d7cQmDybdr8-8g,"SHUT THE CLUCK UP!

Hattie B's is a must-go for locals and visitors alike. My favorites on the menu are hot fried chicken tenders and the pimento mac & cheese. Lots of great sides to choose from though if you want to mix it up. 
Be prepared to wait in line at peak dining times and be prepared to wait again for your food to arrive to your table. Thankfully, the timing from the time you order until your food arrives has improved greatly over the past few months.
Definitely go!

Mild: Order if you're 94
Medium: Order if you're scared
Hot: Order if you want the best meal ever
Damn Hot: Order if you enjoy eating seasoning straight from a shaker
Shut the Cluck Up: Order for your least favorite in-law",,
D2_DK37VKTzClbzQ76ME1w,,"I've always enjoyed oysters. However, being from Southern California, they are not always available. Having an oyster bar at almost every restaurant was one thing I was really looking forward to during our trip to New Orleans.
Acme House did not disappoint.  My wife and I went there twice during the week stay. Both times we got lucky and were seated right away. I've read reviews about the line going around the corner and was thrilled we didn't have to wait in the heat. 
The staff was extremely nice and helpful with their welcoming suggestions. We started off with a dozen raw oysters and a dozen char grilled oysters. Hands down, the best I've ever had. 

Another great thing about this restaurant is the draft beer selection. I really enjoyed getting acquainted with the local beer, Abita. Some were better than others, but that's generally the case for most breweries. My favorite is the Andy Gator. I only came across a couple of places that served this beer and was thrilled to find out they even had it on tap! 

If I ever return to New Orleans again, I'll be sure to make this one of my first stops.",

D3PNyk9_2Tebki6nTcQH_w,,,We decided to just have appetizers for dinner and boy are we glad we did.  The Crab cakes were the best that I have had in a long time.  They were meaty and the crawfish sauce on top was a perfect compliment.  The alligator bites were just that - alligator meat.  They were not mixed with other fillers so all you got was the meat. The raw oysters were big and plump.  We must have hit it at the perfect time.  We were seated right away and the service staff was great.  We will definitely put this place on your list of places to come back to.

The line outside was clearly more tourists who probably saw the restaurant advertised in their hotel rooms or at the airport as they came into the city, than people who are regulars to this spot. The pasta that I had, included little bites of alligator, which was very tender, but the shrimp, sausage, and pasta itself was very bland. My friend had the fried seafood, which was very basic, and pretty much impossible to mess up, and frankly mediocre. On the other hand, the ""tropical storm"" cocktail was delicious. It was very sweet, and delightful. And as an added little gimmick, they place dry ice in it, causing it to bubble and it looks really cool."

D4eVxqcWuh4xjAz8kUguVg,"Much debate has been had over the Hattie B vs. Prince's duel for Nashville's best hot chicken.  I confess that I was only able to taste test one of the contestants on my last trip to Nashville and will make a beeline for Prince's on the next trip.  As for Hattie B, I will say it's a darn good hot chicken sandwich.  Calibrating your correct heat level is critically important.  Too low and you stood in line for little more than a good Chick-fil-A; too hot and you'll either get back in line or choke down some flaming misery while hiding your tears from those staring longingly from the line in the street.  I went ""medium"" and thought it was just the right amount of kick to enhance the experience.  Avoid the banana pudding, which is not good enough for elaboration.",,

D57haLzXs_bDxtmSlIA4HA,,"Acme Oyster House lived up to the hype and then some! We didn't have to wait long as we lined up shortly after the heavens opened and poured every inch of water it had directly over NOLA.  Luckily this avalanche of a rainstorm only lasted about an hour and (side note: so impressed with NOLA's drainage system) because whatever flood was occurring on the streets quickly disappeared and dried up giving us the opportunity to run over and wait in the short Acme Oyster House line.

Now on to the food. Those chargrilled oysters might be up there with the last thing I want to eat before I die.  I reserve that for a very and I mean very select few food items, but whatever combination of butter, cheesy lovin' goes into those slimy suckers is just done to PERFECTION. You can't come here and not order the chargrilled oysters. It would be a shander. It would be a crime (and I am a lawyer saying this), so don't question the calories...just do it!

So, you are going to order the chargrilled oysters --check. 

Now, you have to order the fried peace maker po-boy (shrimp and oyster with a hint of Tabasco mayo). MIND BLOWING!!! This was the best po-boy on the trip hands down (and I made it my mission to try a po-boy almost everywhere).  Better than Mother's (sorry Mother's.. I did love that Ferdi's Special though!). The seasoning on the shrimp and oyster is what sets it apart and I think they get the plumpest shrimp and oysters around.  It really make a difference when taking a bite into that soft bread, crunchy perfectly seasoned shrimp and oysters, and feeling that Tabasco mayo on your lips. YUM YUM YUM!!!

So, you are going to order the peace maker po boy--check. 

The hubs and I also got Boo Fries (french fries topped with roast beef gravy and cheese) and red beans and rice (my first time in NOLA so I though these were a must.. they were a must in NOLA but not in life to be honest).

The boo fries were delicious but the stars of the show and what dreams are made of are definitely the chargrilled oysters and peace maker po-boy.  

Acme Oyster House--keep doing what you continue to do. Also, sitting at the bar was fun too watching the pros shuck oysters. Such a cool experience overall and a place not to be missed when in NOLA.",
D5MYvUjjUkyh6IsKnoeebQ,,Amazing! We got the chargrilled oysters with crab meat. Alligator bites were crispy and great. Honestly you can get anything from here and you will not be disappointed. Get here early to avoid the lines! The later the night the longer the lines,

The chargrilled oysters is the best on their menu. The best part is to use the bread dipped into the buttery sauce on the tray, it taste like heaven, I'm not a fan of their raw oyster though. 
Their soft shell crab was delicious too.","We ordered a blackened chicken poboys and fried shrimp platter. The blackened chicken was very delicious, however the fried shrimp not worth it. It's taste normal but cost $17. The services and restaurant atmosphere is great. I'll recommend blackened whatever you can get in the restaurant."

We walked in and it was an energized, exciting ambience. The lights were dimmed ultra low. Every seat had some buns in it. The servers were whipping around the corners fast with trays and trays of oysters. The inside smelled like the sea. It was fun and exciting. It didn't feel touristy even though it's in the touristy area of New Orleans.
We ordered a few drinks and the bartenders were accommodating, quick and attentive but not overly-friendly. The charbroiled oysters were incredible. They were broiled real good, crispy and flavorful but still tasted like oysters. We ordered two dozen and that wasn't enough. We could have eaten them all night.

It is fun to belly up to the oyster bar and rap with the shuckers.  some have been there decades and they have some stories to tell.

Did have a bad experience though last time i was there. We went to settle the bill as the shucker who had been entertaining us encouraged us to pay cash. Why? so he could stuff the tip in his pocket and not share with the rest of the wait staff. He as much as told us that

This is whats depressing about NOLA at times, good, authentic, hard working, jive talking worker giving us a great show at the same time trying to beat the rest of the staff out of their living.  No honor anymore

I was happy to see they also had a few vegetarian options which is rare for a city like New Orleans. So I couldn't get a reservation beforehand but we didn't have to wait that long (we got there at 6:30 and waited for around 15 minutes).

The vibe inside is really great and relaxed. Our waiter was very accommodating and understanding of my ""dietary restrictions"". He recommended the cajun veggie stew for me without butter or cheese. Since my mum's a huge seafood lover, she got two types of oysters as an appetizer and the catfish special with blackened catfish, fried crawfish and jambalaya rice. My stew also came with rice and was really rich and delicious. I loved that it was spicy too. My mum said her oysters were especially good and the catfish was done really nicely too.

D9i3LUq4UHh9rg62kym8yA,,"Anytime I hear Acme all I can think of is the fictional corporation featured in Road Runner, Pinky and the Brain, and Animaniacs.  Oh the good ole days.  Anyways let's get back on track, Acme Oyster House is the bomb and you should stop on by.  My sister and I (yes we eat out together a lot) dropped in for brunch and we must have come at the right time because there was no wait and were seated immediately at the bar.  When we left there was a line outside the restaurant, sorry suckers! 

Since we weren't too hungry (keyword TOO because we have healthy appetites) we split an order of the jambalaya, a cup of gumbo, a dozen raw oysters, and each had an oyster shooter.  Is this how the other half of the world lives??  The oysters we ordered were delicious, not necessarily the best I've ever had but they were decent sized and had substance to them.  The oyster shooter was a little stronger than expected and burned a bit going down due to the horseradish and vodka but I guarantee it will wake your behind up!  The jambalaya was DELICIOUS.  I've had jambalaya in Chicago and my mom used to attempt to make it when we were kids but it does not compare to this.  The rice was cooked perfectly whereas other jambalaya I've had was sticky or mushy and the seasoning was on point with a nice kick from the andouille sausage.  I highly recommend trying the jambalaya.  The last thing we tried was the cup of the seafood gumbo which I enjoyed but my sister wasn't a fan of.  Good, more for me!  It had shrimp and supposedly crab but I couldn't find any in there and a scoop of rice on top. It wasn't overly flavorful but definitely is good comfort food.  

I like to think my sister and I are professional eaters, we literally sat down, ate, and paid the check within 15 minutes.  Impressive, right?  It also helps that the service was on point, we received our oyster shooters almost immediately after placing the order followed by the rest of the food within minutes.  Now that is my kind of dining. What I'd take away from my brunch experience here is that service is quick, ambiance is casual and welcoming, and the food is delicious.",
DABYjL14JtIsYbyILNtc3w,,Jesus Christ this place has the greatest fried crawfish tail po boy in the world. I ordered a half sandwich with a cup of gumbo and I had to order a second serving as soon as I finished the first. The seafood gumbo was unbelievable.,

I love oysters and eat them anyway I can get them....raw, fried, grilled. Pretty much everything else on the menu is mediocre. I have always gotten decent to great service here so service isn't really ever an issue here for me. But what keeps me away from coming here more often for the oysters is the constant line that is always there outside the restaurant. Expect to wait 30 minutes or longer any time you go. This Acme location brings in the dough with its revolving door of tourists.",

We got there right when they opened up and the line was already out the door and down the street. It took us an hour and ten minutes to order our food. Yes we made friends in line with everyone around us but the wait was ridiculous. We expected to be blown out of the water by the taste of the food but keep reading.

I ordered the SM Dark hot with mac and cheese and crinkle fries and my girlfriend ordered the chicken sandwich mild with Mac and cheese. 

The food arrived within 5 of sitting at the table and they accidentally gave her beans instead of Mac and cheese. The waiter was cool and said I guess you got a bonus order of beans and brought her a Mac and cheese.

So first bite of the SM Dark Hot chicken leg and the skin was good and was nice and spicy. The Mac and cheese was mediocre as well as the ""bonus"" beans. My girlfriend's chicken sandwich was good but again it didn't live up to the hype and blown us away.  

If you wanted to stop here just to say you've been, then by all means, go stand in line for an hour to eat and get your plastic cup.

We won't ever stand in line that long to eat here but that doesn't mean it was horrible, it was just ok.",,

DD0YfJTGHm34jRHDJ2xs-A,,"So much hype....Is the food good? Yes. Is it amazing or life changing? No. 

Acme has lineage and history, and serves good quality food, but the reality is there are so many other equally good or better options out there, (that do not require you to stand in line next to dumpsters) that Acme feels less special. 

The line to get in felt artificially inflated. We waited about 30-40 minutes to get seated and there were several tables near us empty and several seats at the bar available. They make you wait to make it feel more exclusive, and because you wait to get inside you feel compelled to order way more than you normally would because you waited. 

We started with the chargrilled oysters, can't complain they're excellent. I also ordered a chicken and andouille gumbo, not a single piece of andouille sausage to be found in the entire bowl. My wife got a combo fish and shrimp po-boy, I ordered the fish po-boy, both were decent but honestly we had better fried seafood at other establishments. We ordered a few sides (like I said we ordered more because we waited) of jambalaya, hush puppies, and onion rings which were about what you expect. 

This is by no means a bad meal, it is in fact a good meal. But is it worth the wait? Can you go down the street and find something comparable? Yes.",

DDixXfHOP76lu6FJu1uw_g,"We basically bar crawled from lower Broadway, through Midtown and up to Hattie B's - this was the last day and best decision during our stay in Nashville.  We already knew that Hattie B's was a destination point before coming down but that morning our Uber driver was really ramping it up and we knew that we had to make it happen that night.

The menu is set up so that you have the opportunity to try a little bit of everything - each entrée comes with two sides or you can order a la carte.  We each ordered an entrée for ourselves and strategically ordered different sides so that we could sample them all...plus a peach cobbler bc our Uber driver was raving so much about it :)

Large Dark came with two large wings over white toast and I went with the creamy potato salad and baked beans.  Everything was so good and the peach cobbler was served nice and hot.  I loved every bite of my meal and knew that if I didn't live literally states away from Hattie B's it would be a problem, I'd be there every Friday getting my fix.

Hattie B's is a must when visiting Nashville.  See you next time!",,"We made our breakfast reservation at Oceana Grill with very medium level expectations - we were pleasantly surprised with quantity and quality.

I opted for the Maw Maw's Country breakfast - the bacon, eggs and jambalaya rice all tasted fresh.  I also ordered a screwdriver because it's still breakfast and it's still New Orleans. 

The orange juice hit the spot and the drink was nice and strong.  

My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy, I was shocked to see that he was served basically a bowl of gravy with a spoon and two biscuits.  That's not how I'd want to eat my biscuits and gravy but it tasted good to me and he was stuffed.  We actually even took some leftovers with us.

Under normal circumstances Oceana would have been in the perfect position to then go bar hopping but with current restrictions we were forced to just keep walking around until it was time for a beignet.

Thank you Oceana for taking reservations and keeping up with the social distancing guidelines to keep us safe."

DEOH_z7QaXnrH7vnmDl5KA,,"In a town known for good food, especially oysters, this place still stands above the rest.  Excellent New Orleans cuisine, charbroiled oysters, gumbo, crawfish puppies (though I really don't like saying out loud that I like eating puppies, doesn't sound right), po'boys. all delicious.  But we found other restaurants with comparable food, there are two added pluses here, the remarkably efficient service and the informal entertainment, and these are connected.  Like all the good places in the French Quarter, this place is really busy, once you're in town for a bit you notice that long lines move at different paces.  Here, they move the line faster than other places, make sure you let them know when they are working the line that you'll take the counter.  That's the most entertaining place to sit anyway.  The front end staff was all African-American except for this one white waiter and he was the only one not working hard.  It was unintentionally symbolic and funny.  Everyone else doesn't just work hard, they work crazy hard but also very smart.  There's an efficiency bred of experience and necessity (it's pretty tight in terms of working space), it's as fascinating to witness as a complex dance.  We had a good view of both the oyster shucking and the handling-of-the-drunks.  A good portion of the evening clientele are younger drunken white people behaving badly.  I can't tell you how interesting it is to watch this skillful crew handle them efficiently.  My chief of staff and I met working crowd control at Wrigley Field, it's really hard to get a group of besotted nincompoops  moving - let alone quickly and with purpose.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in the country.",
DEZwG27HkCu-C1OE09EEvg,"I wish I took pictures to show how crispy and delicious the chicken is here but no one has time for that. After being recommended this place by multiple people in Nashville, as visitors, we had to check it out. We came on a Friday night, and there was a line out the door but ordering is fast. A lot of people suggest ordering online, which is a smart idea, but we definitely got the full experience not doing that. Its also really hard finding parking in their parking lot as it is so busy so we parked a few blocks away. At the end of the day, this is a good idea so we could walk off all the food we ate.  We ordered a few different pieces of hot chicken. I love how there are different levels of heat here. We got medium and that was enough! we also ordered a bunch of sides, including Southern Greens, Mac and Cheese, Cole Slaw, and Black Eyed Pea Salad. 

In the rush the rush they did forget my order and we had to remind the server but I think that happens when the restaurant is swamped and they took care of it right away. The chicken was the best chicken and was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. There was just the right amount of heat. The Greens were a good balance for the chicken and the mac and cheese was good because who doesn't like mac and cheese. We ordered a peach cobbler for desert. It was sweet and thick but I really liked the crust. 

I thought the food was amazing and exactly what I was expecting. The outdoor seating are was a nice place to east our meal and there was plenty of seating as people finish their meal and leave.  My friends thought it was heavy and greasy but this is Southern food. Do not come here expecting a lean meal.",,

DEa7zDve9DP70QmaqJcShQ,,,Food was great. Waitress was terrible. She knew nothing about the menu or how the food was prepared. She really needed to know how to say more than ummmmmmm let me check on that for you.

DF3pL8EatKCBfsF0ok1qYw,,,"I was very surprised by this place. It is right off bourbon st and the first night we were in town it was the perfect place. I mean as sooooon as we put our orders in for our Po boys they were already on their way out. It was the fastest I have ever received food ever. The second time we went on our second to last night, it was a complete 180. The service was terrible. The food orders were wrong and the food wasn't as good. Consistency would be a much better thing."
DFC5Nb0Kcycvq6SEI_n9Yg,,"Acme Oyster House is definitely an experience to be had!  I must warn you, the place can get very busy....very fast....so make sure you get there early.  A line can easily form during the first 30 minutes of dinner hour and can stretch all the way down the street, maybe even around the corner!  We got there right before the dinner rush, at around 4:45/5 Pm, so we were very lucky to get seated right away!  
Now, if you've never had an oyster, but you're curious, this would definitely be the place to try them out.  You can buy a dozen or a half dozen, and they come prepared in many different ways.  I myself am not an oyster fan, so I stayed away from them.  
Their menu has decent prices and you can find a pretty good deal if you get one of their dinner combos.  I went for the half and half fried fish platter.  I got half a serving of fried shrimp and half a serving of fried catfish.  Now, if the amounts of each fish I was served was TRULY half, then the original servings must be HUGE!!!  My meal consisted of two large fillets of catfish breaded and fried, served over a heaping helping of seasoned fries, the fried shrimp and pieces of toasted baguette.  It also came with a side of very crispy, to-die-for hush puppies.    The catfish fillets were absolutely delicious and like nothing I'd ever tasted before.  The fillets were moist and flaky and I could taste the freshness of the gulf waters in the fish.  I felt as if I was eating a fish I had just caught not a moment before.  The shrimp was very different--they were crispy on the outside, moist on the inside (the way fried shrimp should be) and had a very different seasoning that had a strange zing to it.  Each bite sent an odd stinging sensation through my sinuses to the point where I couldn't eat more than 4 shrimps.  Thinking it was just me, I passed them off to my comrades and they had the same sensations.  Maybe it was just the batch I got? Maybe not; all I know is I don't think I'll be ordering the shrimp again....OH WELL!!! at least the extremely delicious hush puppies, perfectly seasoned fries and beautifully cooked catfish made up for it!  And all for under $20!!!  Definitely can't beat that.  
If you have the chance to visit Acme Oyster House, do it!  If there's a line, it's worth the wait.  I highly recommend it.",
DFKkX5h-kX4tABEbVfp45g,,Never had an oyster in my life!! At 30 I finally did and I'm sooo happy In was Acmes Charboiled Oysters. The garlic butter sauce is delicious I can't believe I waited so long. The crab cakes are also highly recommended.,

I think this place is benefitting too heavily from the Internet echo chamber. It has so many good reviews that people line up and write more good reviews because we believe it must be wonderful if we waited so long for it. It gets more stellar reviews and lines get longer. Meanwhile the food is good but not to die for and definitely not worth the wait. Just as good or better to be had elsewhere, no waiting outside in the blazing sun to get it.",,

So when he found out I would be in Nashville for work he told me I ""had to"" try it. Totally worth the wait. I had the small white plate with greens and Mac and Cheese as sides. I ate every speck. Might come back to Nashville just to eat at Hattie Bs again!",,
DK57YibC5ShBmqQl97CKog,,"Come here for the tasty oysters. We decided to get a half dozen, char-grilled. I also ordered the medley (Jambalaya, gumbo, grilled sausage, red beans and rice), and tried some of the peacemaker po-boy. 

The oysters had a deep smokey flavor, with a buttery cheesy concoction cooked with them. Quite good, although they were just slightly overcooked and a little tough. I wasn't too impressed with the medley. First of all, the portions were pretty small for the price ($13) The red beans and rice were a bit bland and mushy, and while the gumbo was made with fresh crab and shrimp, there were pieces of crab shell in the soup providing an unpleasant and unexpected crunch when trying to eat the soup. The jambalaya and smoked sausage were decent. The peacemaker po-boy (Fried shrimp and oyster) was excellent. The bread had the right balance of crunch and chewiness, and the seafood was fried to perfection.

Service, while friendly, was uneven. Since there always seems to be a slew of people waiting outside in line, and a slew of people being seated at any time, it took a bit of time to get our orders in. Aside from getting our initial fill of drinks (Iced tea), we didn't get any service in between our meal for refills.",
DKFVR3rof_LXMbqO9N4-_Q,,,Enjoyed  the courtyard for dining. It's very relaxing and the tables are spread out nicely. The staff wears masks. The food was good and prices were fair. We had the shrimp po boy and catfish po boy. They have a decent amount of choices for dessert.

DKst76KWk9v_R7E3wfTFYQ,,,"Being born and raised in New Orleans ....I was very disappointed by the food but actually not surprised. The food was very very mediocre...more like tourist food then real New Orleans food. My boyfriend and I order the seafood platter. It was a very small plate with small portions of food. It came with catfish, fried shrimp, hush puppy's, and fried oysters. All of the food was dry, from the catfish dwn to the oysters , just terrible. Our food was warm not steaming hot, it was as if they warmed it in the microwave or something. I will never return to the restaurant for some food. I would rather get a hot dog at the hot dog stand on bourbon."

DLTEjTArAa2hlKUK32lZHw,"When in Nashville, you eat Nashville Hot Chicken. Finally got to try Hattie B's at their new location on Broadway. Boy were they busy, but service was quick and friendly.

Initially I wanted to try the hot chicken sandwich, but since I wanted to try the mac and cheese and their fries, I decided to get just the tenders for balance 

Everything about the meal just worked. I ordered ""hot"" for my spice level and it was perfect, not too spicy and provided the best level of flavor to kick ratio. I actually like my spicy chicken this way with dry rub as opposed to buffalo wings being wet and saucy. 

The sides complimented everything well, with the creamy, mac and cheese for one bite, and the crunchy, seasoned fries with the other. I feel like some of the imitations I've had in Chicago are close to this and will fulfill any cravings I have, but there's something unique and special about eating Nashville Hot Chicken at Hattie B's right on Broadway.",,
DLpDP-h4XXypsaH0cBZMJQ,,"Eight of us ate lunch at Acme today and were fortunate not to have stand in line.    We immediately greet by our server (Shawn) who continued to provide outstanding service throughout our meal  

We ordered four dozen of the chargrilled oysters and would have ordered more if we hadn't planned on other menu items.   However, the oysters were definitely the highlight of our meal, but the other items we ordered were also delicious.   We all agreed that we would recommend this restaurant and would eat here again when we are in New Orleans again.",
DM95VIVHDcRyG549lR7KKQ,,"Nothing really special here, basically another production line tourist restaurant famous only by Man vs. Food, our raw oysters served with copious amounts of chipped shell, and at room temperature. Chargrilled Oysters cooked away to practically nothing, but it's a fantastic place if you're drunk, in your twenties, like it very loud, and don't mind being constantly bumped and jostled by extremely fast servers who do a semi-passable job at remembering what you ordered.

Me and my husband will visit this restaurant again"
DMV24whWQ97qeDQRT1qMqw,,,An outstanding breakfast this morning.  The crab cakes on english muffins with eggs and crawfish was tasty and wholesome.  My wife had the omelet and it was equally excellent.  We highly recommend this restaurant as they are consistent in both food and service.  Megan provided excellent service.  She was friendly and we got a little Lanippae as she shared her knowledge of the local area.

There's a really good variety of food and drink choices and they are GOOD! Ordered the Taste of New Orleans platter and it was great! Jambalaya, crawfish ettoufe and red beans and rice. It did NOT disappoint! The Tropical Storm drink was also good!

We didn't have reservations or anything (unsure if they take reservations) but waited about 20-30 minutes before being seated. Nice and spacious location and seating areas, inside and out. Located right off of Bourbon Street and very convenient. Staff is SUPER friendly and helpful in making decisions.

All around great place to eat and have a good time! If you're in Nola, try out Oceana Grill!"

The sides are also all really good, the atmosphere is great and the staff are always really nice. Such a little gem. It's EXTREMELY crowded at lunch time during the week, so beware.

There was also a wait when I went there, probably because it's located near Bourbon Street/a tourist location. Line moved fairly quickly though. Personally, I probably wouldn't try coming back here if I ever visited NOLA again."
DN6erJry7mAq6jYeCxRrVA,,,Meh.  Just ok in my book.  Roast beef sandwich was weak.  But that's as much my fault for ordering that at a seafood joint.

The oysters here are really good.  I personally am a fan of the raw oysters, but the charboiled ones were good as well.  They charboileds came out sizzling hot and would steam and sizzle even more when you put a little lemon on top.  Pretty good stuff.  Try Deanie's around the corner for a different version of charboileds that come with more cheese and what not.  Also if the lines are too long, I here Felix has a delicious offering of oysters as well.

We also ordered the etouffee and the Medley (gumbo, jambalaya, red beans & rice, and sausage).  The ettoufee was a bit plain.  I like my food spicey and the etouffee here can't even compare to Coop's.  The medley was pretty good though.  Out of the different samplers provided with the medley,  I actually liked the red beans and rice the most.  So simple, but so good.  Simplicity sometimes just can't be beat.  Just like how sometimes those hole-in-the-walls are better than fine dining.  Gotta mix it up!",

My friend and I dined at Oceana Grill for breakfast on a quiet Sunday morning. We were greeted and seated immediately in an upstairs dining area (SN: There were a lot of different rooms with patrons; I'm assuming they separated customers based on what meal they were having.)

My friend remembered visiting Oceana Grill some years ago with her father and really wanted to have the meal she enjoyed on her last visit. Unfortunately, because we were there during the Essence Festival Weekend, Oceana Grill had given us a limited/special occasion menu. The waiter, an older gentleman who didn't seem at all enthused about his job, was actually helpful in getting the kitchen to make her meal.

I had the St. James Crepe and I must say, it was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my life! Everything was cooked to perfection! If we had time the next morning, we would have definitely stopped here again for breakfast.

There was a ""percentage off"" offer available for checking in on Yelp. It certainly pays to be a Yelper!"

I bookmarked this location and decided it would be one of my first things to try in Nashville. I drove by during lunch hour and the line looked ridiculous so I decided to come back in the evening which was a much shorter line. It was a Thursday night but the NFL draft was happening so I am not sure if my 15-so minute wait in line was an anomaly.

There is plenty of decisions to make here-- white and dark meat choices, do you prefer chicken pieces/ tenders/ chicken sandwiches, how spicy do you prefer it ? I opted for the spicy level which was the perfect level of spice (I usually go with medium for Asian cuisines). There sides are also delicious too-  I had coleslaw, Mac and cheese, and fries.

Service was super friendly and efficient. I am from LA and there's a poppin' Nashville-inspired hot chicken spot in LA in which people would wait hours on end for!  The wait is just so ridiculous they I don't have an afternoon to waste.  

I am so glad I didn't have to do that here.  It makes me realize you can run a business that is both 1) highly popular / visited 2) efficient.",,"The food is great but the customer service is seriously lacking, hence the mediocre experience.

Upon walking down French Quarter, you can observe a line during lunch and dinner hours as well.  The space is somewhat limited so you may need to wait outside at the beginning.

(+) they do reservations - don't try for last minute!  They will ask you to come in. 
(+) decent selection of dishes - I feel like if you're into variety and want a great Southern food experience, this is one of the restaurants. 
(+) our waitress gave us good recommendations as to what dishes to try or what was possible to be shared
(+) Opens late

(-) my significant other dropped his utensils when we were being served and the busboy/ server literally just glared at us like we were stupid children when we requested a replacement. Are you hinting there's no such thing as accidents? The server's body gesture was quite evident that he wouldn't be fulfilling our request, which was true. We had to ask our waitress and snitch on you, just kidding.  Our waitress also seemed fatigued / rolled her eyes/ didn't care. 

I guess this is the feeling most people would get if they go from dining at Commander's Palace (known for their exceptional customer service) at lunch to dinner here eh??? Back to reality folks and boy does it hurt! 
 
Overall, service was whatever which really ruined our dining experience."

You'll be sorely disappointed if you wait in line for an hour just for this.

I can't imagine, with that kind of business, the establishment is struggling -- clean it up! Take some pride!",,
DTFOGN81zlhrYENyvwQ79w,,"Acme is a New Orleans staple. Can you get better food elsewhere? Absolutely, but it's pretty solid. The location in the French Quarter almost always has a line down the block, but the line usually moves quickly.

Acme was our first stop when we arrived in New Orleans Friday afternoon. We had a party of five and didn't wait in line long at all. They're known for their oysters, so I started off with a 1/2 dozen chargrilled ones. They were plump and delicious! When they arrived to the table, they were sizzling hot. For my entree, I decided on the 1/2 shrimp po boy and a cup of crab & corn bisque. Everything tasted great. The po boy was filled with tiny shrimp and the bisque was excellent. Our waitress was very welcoming and accommodated us very well given how busy they were.",

The food was the best I've ever had.  The gumbo, red beans and rice, etouffee, and lost bread were amazing.    A lot of people gave it bad reviews for the service, but I was always treated  well.  Next time I got back to New Orleans, I will be going back again!"

DTZu_5aL69W0AJtPS_UK5Q,"This place is not that spicy at all, I would recommend hot and anything above that if you want a kick of some sort. Delicious chicken though, very well seasoned. If you're here for the coveted chicken and waffles that's only available on the weekend, be prepared for long. long. lines. The only way to properly avoid them is to come before they open at 11 am. Sometimes, fried chicken and waffles are worth the sacrifice of an extra couple of hours of zz's.",,

DTueHsSQKyA9OCDXJqfg0Q,,"This place definitely made my vacation here in New Orleans. I was so stunned by how good it was, especially at the price paid. I highly highly highly (have I emphasized it enough now?) recommend the charbroiled oysters. Something about them is so scrumptious, and they are covered in romano cheese. 

You'll inevitably wait in line if you have a huge group, and there are people waiting at all times of the day. Just as an FYI, just wait in the line and someone will come and get your name. You don't need to go inside to put your name down.",
DUBKVs_zM23Zpd_9cFYGww,"Might be ten pounds heavier after getting Hattie B's twice in a weekend (dinner and brunch) but I was only in Nashville for a few days and couldn't get enough.

The line is crazy long. Don't expect going at a ""less popular time"" will make a difference. My recommendation is either wait it out (~30-60 min depending on the time) or order out where there is no line and they text you when the order is ready!

The hot fried chicken is super moist! The grilled chicken was good, but was a bit drier. Warning- the fried chicken spices ramp up quick- you'll see in my picture the difference between medium and hot spice. If you don't like spice much, don't go past mild- even mild will make your tongue sizzle a bit. Be sure to get some blue cheese or ranch just in case! Also, pay the $2 for an extra tender- they taste amazing (even cold) after drinking all night!

The waffles are really well cooked. I enjoyed making mini waffle/chicken sandwiches and dipping it in syrup!

As for sides: mac&cheese was really good, the cheddar grits were amazing, the fries were tasty. My friends got the potato salad and said it was alright, nothing special.

Finally: The Peach Cobbler is AMAZING. for $3, well worth getting the large!",,

The sides we're fantastic and someone at our table got banana pudding and it looked so good but I didn't want to go back through the line to get myself one. Can't wait to go back!!!,,

Having been burned by Prince's a couple nights earlier, we opted for a large medium and a small hot. Prince's is heavily seasoned with a dry rub while Hattie B's is a little more glaze-like. Both are great but in my one experience, Hattie B's chicken was a little too dry. Hattie B's does beat Prince's with their sides menu. While the pimento mac & cheese was a little underwhelming, the collard greens were solid.",,

We were looking at the menu and they suggested we try the fried shrimp platter, they even went so far as to share a shrimp from the takeout order that just came out of kitchen. So delicious!  So I ordered that for entree and was not disappointed. 14 medium sized shrimp on a bed of crispy fries with coleslaw and served with cocktail and tarter sauce.  Hats off to our server, Jessica who couldn't have been more nice and helpful with every part of our dinner experience. Would nominate her for ""employee of the month"" if that was an option. Highly recommend this eatery."

We ordered:
Oceana chargrilled oysters: I actually prefer the simple chargrilled oysters at other places as I feel the sauce on the oysters were a bit overpowering. 
Crab cakes: these were yummy and the portion is big! 
New Orleans sampler: gumbo, jambalaya"

Eddie, our server was very nice and made sure my birthday dinner was perfect. We will be back!"

The shrimp were tiny like the caned. Shrimp had no taste other than fried oil and the bread wasn't Binders. Bad po boy!!!!!!!
My wife had a small shrimp po boy and hers tasted the same, just a bad sandwich. She had the gumbo and it was tasteless, a poor excuse for gumbo. Told our waitress that the gumbo was horrible and she said OK, didn't take it off the bill. 

All and all a bad day for eating, should have tried Felix.",

DWhfnb3sIXihwPg4qmsh2Q,,,"This restaurant has the worst food in the French Quarter. The tuna my husband had was tough and had been previously frozen. The fried shrimp has thick tough batter on it and tasted like shrimp from the frozen food section of a grocery store. Actually frozen shrimp from the grocery store would have been better. Our bill was $80 plus tip. You can get better food elsewhere in the French Quarter. 
I really think giving them one star is overrated."
DWi47Hm2vg5Z1WCChJLq3g,,"Worth the wait and regret once we'd eaten half the menu. Having missed breakfast due to an early flight in from Chicago, we dropped our luggage at the hotel and scurried over to Acme around 11:30am. The line was already forming - totally worth the wait. Once in and settled at the bar, we went for it. Chargrilled Oysters were my personal favorite, but we also enjoyed raw Oysters, bomb bomb shrimp, fried Oysters, fried clams, softshell crab, the platter - jambalaya, bisque, red beans and rice, and more. On top of that, we enjoyed some drinks. Once done, we all enjoyed a good coma at the hotel before heading back out.",

DY95NdqXaLqdaNM0qIHCpw,,"Great, casual dining (4 of 4 stars)

(see explanation of ratings below)

We arrived at 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon and there was a twenty minute wait---- but it was worth it.

Best dish: char-grilled oysters.  They put cheese on them which hardens and gets crusty.  The oysters arrive sizzling to your table, so let them cool a bit first.

Also, liked the gravy-cheese fries.

About $30 per person for lunch (gratuity not included).

About my ratings:

Only fine dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.

Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):

1) fast food (no table service)

2) casual dining (table service)

3) fine dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, typically more expensive than casual dining)

Fine dining can earn a max of five stars.  Casual dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars.",
DYA9fr6S_Kt_LX_Engeo5A,"The wait is so worth it!!! They open at 11:00am. If you would like to not wait; i suggest you arrive at 10:30 to be one of the first few to be there first. The line can go to mid block so if you come after 11, don't come hungry bc you will wait. 

Now onto the food; everything is delicious. If you like spicy but want the kick and flavor of this juicy chicken, get medium. If you don't care for spicy but want a light kick, pick mild. 
 
My husband and ordered a small dark and small waffle plate with an extra tender to try the tenders. They sell the tenders individually $2 each. It's totally a must try if you don't get the tender plate. 

The dark meat (leg and thigh) is so delicious! Super juicy chicken that melts in your mouth. The breading is perfect bc it doesn't over power the chicken or feel heavy. My husband liked the waffles, but I felt he got full from the waffles versus enjoying the Hot chicken. 

On to the sides: Cole slaw is a must. It helps balance the spice from the chicken gives you a change in palette. The Mac and cheese is so GOOD!!! It's perfect. It's cheesy, creaming and a good little kick with the pimento. Soooo good. The potatoes salad is also very good if you want a fresh taste from the chicken. Comes with bacon bits inside. 

If you come to Nashville, you have to grab some of this chicken they have several location and also do pick up orders.",,
DYEPP8K2ZqBqIHZmRxhV-Q,,"The chargrilled oysters were so good the first time we tried them, we went back again twice in one trip.  The hushpuppkes and seafood gumbo were  also delicious, but my mouth is still watering thinking of the oysters. Although the one retreat we had this whole trip was trying an oyster shooteR here. It needed a lot more cocktail sauce. But I guess that's what you get when you're being adventours and are trying new things. The wait is worth it and I'm looking forward to going back next trip.",
DYq69eNaX_JB2ae-sr-21w,,,Sat at the bar and spent a pleasant few hours. Good appetizers and chocolate mousse cake is well worth the splurge. Cocktails were tasty but I noticed some bartenders were more skilled than others.
DYxvs0OB_ZUz-acckMgD_A,"Hattie B's is a MUST. The hot chicken there is to die for. Very delicious. Seen here is the ""Hot"" chicken the mild burger and Hot tenders. .
There are multiple hattie B's in town. I tagged the location of this particular one. I tried the another Hattie B but was not very pleased with the flavor tbh so didn't bother seeing the location.
Anyway, happy eating.

DZMIRjbNLmoX34oU2pf68Q,,"Came to this restaurant because of how many good reviews it has here. Unfortunately, I left disappointed after trying their etouffe. It was the blandest ever and it had a taste of ""package"" kinda like plastic.  On the bright side, I ordered the best oysters I have ever tried.  The charbroiled oysters, prepared with cheese and lots of garlic. This was delicious. Also, be prepared to wait in line to be seated. I would not go back.  I am sure there are far better restaurant but this one seems to be popular likely because of the location, in the center of tourists area.",
DZRcZEPBisfR-TsIqUconA,,"OMG!!!!!i could end there but I'm supposed to share more about the restaurant.  Had the oyster shooter - excellent.  Oyster platter - excellent.  Gumbo was ok.  Wife had the fried crab platter  and jambalaya.  It was ok.  The jambalaya was average.  

Service was good for the crowd.  It was crazy crowded and you have to sit next to strangers due to the setup, but we had good couples on both sides of us. I would recommend but don't go on the weekend or an event.",
DZjWbKeOukq9Fb8rJRYZ0A,"Maybe they had a bad night? We ordered the food togo because we knew there would be a long wait/line. The window where I was told to pick up the food has a closed sign and was physically closed and blocked by the line. NBD, as I happily skipped the line walked inside and ask the dining associate where to pick up. She kindly and quickly grabbed my order and I was out the door.

Let me say, that I should have read the cues. Any type I talked to local shop owners about Hattie's nobody really gave any good feedback...Like In n Out in California this place is simply overhyped.

There's a way to have more than just hot chicken. I was expecting hot with flavor but nah,... it was just hot. My boyfriend had the second to last hottest, while I opted for mild. It was juicy chicken for sure, and I hate to say it but Popeyes did it better. 

We did have a couple of sides. The pimento Mac & cheese and French fries were normal- nothing mind blowing. Coleslaw and beans were yummy though. We also had peach cobbler and that was pretty good too. 

Again, maybe they had a bad night....",,
D_-NWbXPWQDN7kE1jkFQZQ,"I wanted to try Hattie's on our quick trip to Nashville, but my grandma and kids wasn't about to stand in the line. There was a line at every location I went by which made me want to eat the chicken even more. So I picked a location and got it to go while the kids and grandma stayed at the hotel. It was a quick in and out thing with no lines. I got an order of mild for the kids and grandma and an order of hot for myself. I got a few sides to try like the black eye pea salad. It was cold, but I really liked it. The chicken was really good too. It beats any Nashville hot chicken that I ever tried. It was also good the next day too.. cold. Yes, cold cuz the hotel didn't have a microwave. I thought it tasted great cold the next day. I would eat here again, to go would be the way to go.",,

Came in right after we landed in nola, and it was a great start for our trip! Delicious chargrilled oysters, yummy étouffée, crunchy crab claws, and awesome fried crawfish. The oysters were seasoned so well I ended up dipping the bread in the leftover juices.

Definitely worth going to again!",

D_dzNKTD9Lpkje3P0nsMqQ,"Let me start by saying,  I am a sucker for pain. 

I take pleasure in the hotter things in life. I feel that eating should at times be challenging. 

Over an hour ago I tried the Damn Hot chicken at Hattie B's and in the 60 minutes since I have gone through a lot of emotions and afflictions. Here is a list :

Pleasure followed by immense pain
Death sweats
Lip quivering 
Ghost sightings (seriously, I think this chicken helped me reconnect with my dead grandma) 
A deep feeling that every fluid is going to leave your body at the same time forming a new you that will bitch slap the old you for doing such a foolish thing. 
Double visions 
7 stages of grief wrapped up into one big fucking stage. 


Now I am no newbie when it comes to hot chicken. I first tasted that sweet stuff in 2007 and have been to all spots in this great city. But today, I feel like Madonna in ""Like A Virgin"". 

It feels like the very first time. 

To anyone who feels like trying the ""Damn Hot"" or if you want to go full fucking Roadhouse and try ""Shut the Cluck Up"" I would say tread lightly and bring a friend cause you will not be able to drive home on your own. 

I could literally see a world where that hot a chicken would be illegal. 

This chicken is diabolical. Like if you put Darth Vader, every Bond villain, Imelda Marcos, that crazy bitch from the Cocaine Cowboys documentary in a blender and then sprinkled it with the Goblin King from Labyrinth, this chicken would kick the shit out of that shake. 

I just left for 20 minutes so that the food that I ate before this chicken could exit my body before shit got real. It must be like John Wayne Gacy's basement in my belly right now. 

That's how serious it is. 

I've had the super hot at Princes. I've had the hot at Pepperfire. Those are fucking New Edition and the Damn Hot at Hattie B's is GWAR. Get out of the front 5 rows if you don't wanna get shit on you.

With all that said, I liked it, but you couldn't pay me to try it again. Hell is a place on earth and it lives inside the Damn Hot  chicken at Hattie B's",,
D_qgxX_jHJSVJpACX8CDVQ,,I got the chargrilled oysters and Boo fries.  The chargrilled oysters are great!  The gravy was only lukewarm on the Boo fries.  I'd say skip the Boo fries.  You won't be missing anything. You can make them better at home if you want with canned gravy & shredded cheese.  Or better yet go get some chili cheese fries somewhere.  Get those chargrilled oysters though....,
Da1YsoioiD45kCX0smOcXw,,"Definitely think the charbroiled oysters here are better than Drago's. The overall food isn't though.  I think they lack a bit in the po' boy area.  A lil stingy on the shrimp, etc. compared to any of your generous neighborhood po' boy spots. Visitors probably will never know that lil' tidbit. 

They do create a nice atmosphere to take watch sporting events, and I must say, hush puppies...mmmm. They do a perfect job in that area,

Char broiled oysters, a big blue moon in a frosted stein, and hush puppies...can't go wrong here.

Lastly, one thing that saddened me is, they don't allow you to order charbroiled oysters to go.  I was devastated to find that out, but they still deliver on taste and quality.",

I chose mild because I'm a wimp but also thinking ""alright this'll have just enough kick for me."" Nope. Nothing. It's not spicy the least little bit. 

SO DO NOT GET MILD if you're hoping for the least bit of heat. The skin is amazing and chicken is juicy and good and the greens.......yes! It's great food but I'm just disappointed I waited for like an hour for basic fried chicken. :(",,

However I hadn't heard of them and they were recommended for Cajun by the reception of the prince conti hotel that we stayed in .we also got a ten percent discount. The service was prompt , the concerns were a bit fake . You get that 'I don't give a shit about you but this is my job' vibes sometimes. I ordered seafood gumbo.

We also had the special of the night which was a Redfish in a Cajun pesto Alfredo sauce & while the flavor was good the fish was very tough...agin I suspect that it was pre cooked as well.  I notice that everyone's food came out quickly. Lastly I ordered dessert to go, it was the tiniest slice of pecan pie I've ever seen."

The place had decent prices and bearable interiors. When it came to the most important aspect, the taste, we were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. We ordered alligator bites, shrimp creole and blackened chicken. All of these dishes were amazing especially the blackened chicken. The blackened chicken came with jambalaya and had the perfect char on top. The shrimp creole was perfectly seasoned and had a large serving. Even the alligator bites which come blackened, fried or half n half (what we ordered) were delicious. These three dishes were sufficient for our group of four.

Are te chicken and had spice flavor in my mouth to really taste the m&c. Great crinkle cut fries. Had a couple of the local beers on draft. Jackalope brown and the lager.

Portions were small for the price you pay.  Service was friendly and helpful.",
DdZ8AGTyFWGzG_E7v6kZRw,,"If it weren't for the chargrilled oysters, this would have been the worst meal I ever ate in New Orleans. Definitely not worth waiting in line for tourist food without enough spice and small portions for the cheap quality ingredients. The service was great even though they forgot to serve my gumbo (I was thankful because my stepmom already had hers, and it wasn't good). I've lived here 4 years - believe me over the thousand plus tourists who haven't been anywhere else in Nola.",
Dde-itrH-XCBkaDTSIiHaw,,"Charbroiled oysters were quite good, but everything else was meh, just ok. 12oz? beers in plastic cups, jambalaya that was mostly rice and I've made better at home, other's friends in my group had fried fish, shrimp and po-boys that looked and tasted just average. Very loud inside so difficult to hear each other. Not worth the wait in the long line, and I wouldn't return.",

Once we ordered and found a spot to sit we waited.  I ordered the Hot Chicken and two sides.  Chicken was hot and good as advertised.  I will be back next time in Nashville and would recommend it to all.",,

I am gluten free which I told the manager  as well as the waitstaff. The oysters I was served were burnt on the shell and hard as a rock. The lemon drop I ordered was like lemonade. I will never be back, the food and the drink was subpar."

I ordered the medium chicken strips with baked beans, Mac and cheese, collard greens. We also ordered the hot chicken strips with fries and pickles. I loooved the baked beans, and the medium chicken was the perfect level of heat and spice for me. All of the food was obviously very fresh. 

We enjoyed this restaurant very much!",,

The crab cakes came with a side of potatoes and vegetables, it tasted sort of mediocre.  I think the food came out TOO quickly--it tasted like it was frozen and had microwaved since some part of the crab cakes were lukewarm and some were hot.  After eating, I felt sort of nauseous right away and I've been having painful stomach cramps/symptoms of food poisoning for two days.  I think the food must have been improperly reheated or something."
DfMMunsk4Kg3EJpFJakwDg,,"Highly suggest Acme for oysters and crawfish! Made this one of my stops on my last trip and it was worth the 20-30 minute wait for a table of 3. The hostess was super sweet and personable. Diane was our waitress and she was very attentive and the best upseller I have ever encountered. 
On to the food, we ordered crawfish, chargrilled oysters, raw oysters, hush puppies, fried soft shell crab, and a trio plate with gumbo, jambalaya, and rice/beans. The crawfish was a pretty good size and juicy. Chargrilled oysters were phenomenal, although the other two in the party weren't very impressed. I don't get any satisfaction with raw oysters, but they do. My friends loved the raw oysters; along with the crawfish, the oysters were, too, a pretty good size. The seafood gumbo and rice/beans were a tad bland, but the jambalaya was very flavorful. The hush puppies, delish. 
I will definitely make sure to visit during future trips.",
DfQra_Nbz5qdrQ49H9AmjQ,,"The food, service, and ambiance was so amazing that I decided to eat here everyday that I spent in New Orleans during Mardi Gras! Very fresh seafood and kick you in the butt cocktails. The staff is very friendly and patient. Food came out in a decent time considering how busy they were. No wonder why the line is wrapped outside the door of this place, it's really worth the wait. I enjoyed the shrimp and oyster Po-boy, with a side of gumbo and fried crawfish tails. The Poboy is MASSIVE. I also tried the New Orleans sampler which was very filling and delicious as well. The oyster shooters added a very nice touch to my entire experience. I was grossed out by the thought of taking a raw oyster shot but wow, I actually liked it! If you are ever in the ""big easy"", this is a stop you will regret not making! So amazed, thank you ACME!",

This was our first stop as soon as we got to New Orleans. Dropped our bags and walked out of the hotel right into Oceana. Best decision ever! Servers and everyone who works there were so kind and inviting. We will go back again and again during every trip to N.O.!"

I just came across the  reciept and had a free minute. Our waitress was Kim P. And when I say rude, i mean, worst waitress ive ever had. The food was up to par, as normal. Everything was taking a long time, which I get. Stuff happens. But that's not an excuse to have an ugly attitude. Any time we asked for something, she rolled her eyes. And mumbled under her breath as she walked away. Then, one of my friends got up to use the restroom and as he walked past her, he overheard her talking about cheap her table was. I mean, idk if it was us, or someone else, but either way, not cool!!! Idk when ill go back.  If i wanted to get talked to like crap,  id go eat at my in-laws.  And not sure id like to go somewhere with standards this low."

Don't miss this place if you visit NO.",
Dg1cJ224IfS2YwuJV5d5wQ,,"I personally don't like oysters in any way, shape or form. But the chargrilled oysters at Acme oyster house have converted me over! Believe the hype and get in line - the wait is worth it!

Chargrilled Oysters (1/2 Doz - $11.50) (1 Doz - $19.49)
These oysters on a half shell are topped with delicious, pungent, garlic seasoning, cheese, and grilled to absolute perfection. Flavor bomb in your mouth! One of the most memorable dishes I had in my entire trip to New Orleans. MUST TRY

Boiled crawfish ($9.49)
Being tourists, we had to order more southern classics! Ordered a pound of the boiled crawfish - which came in an adorable bag made out of a net. How fitting! The crawfish was seasoned generously and the meat was deliciously moist. Great to share, but be warned - crawfish is a LOT of work to eat and the meat is very little! 

Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy ($12.99)
After having delicious a delicious po-boy around NOLA - we had to try the one here at ACME! A nice size sandwich stuffed with fried oysters and shrimp. Being that po-boys are so messy to eat we asked for the sauce to be on the side. Big mistake! Let them top you off with the tabasco infused mayo sauce. Eating any part of this sandwich without it is just wrong! You need the creamy sauce to give the fried sandwich some flavor!

The restaurant's decor is so unique with all sorts of lighting, signs, TVs, and cool oyster grilling stations. Great place to grab a beer and chow down on some delicious seafood! No wonder the lines are so long!",
DgEUWw3MtFkKvM_qfaRAIQ,,,"This was one of my favorite meals in New Orleans everything from the service ,to the drinks, and the food was perfection! Our waitress name was Regene D. she was amazing super sweet called us all ""My Baby""  I asked for her recommendation and I am so glad I did  she went above and beyond for us and definitely made our experience one to remember. The food she recommended was delicious super flavorful good Ol southern food, the type of food that makes you wish you had a second stomach so you can eat more lol. The restaurant is only a few feet from bourbon street so if you go for dinner be prepared to walk outside to a party, some won't like that but for us it was a perfect way to start our night and it definitely added to the experience. Eat here enjoy a few drinks , take in the party environment you won't regret it!"

The piles of oysters in glass cases are gone.... the big black 200 lb "" defensive line"" looking guys are gone shucking in front of you. The ""show"" is sadly gone.... even when I tried to take a picture of the oysters on the grill the manager said "" no pictures"" ....what was this? a family secret that everyone serving oysters in NOLA has anyway? Anyone who knows a thing about raw oysters know oysters from this area are somewhat tasteless , fairly meaty and actually works best grilled. The character of the Acme Oyster house is what made it famous!! This place now looks more like a sports bar than a famous oyster shack. I love old school things..... some things should adapt with the times. Others like Acme Oyster house never should have changed !! Wish you could have seen it.......",

I took a chance and ordered something that was suggested by our waitress/bartender (Amanda) and boy was the 'Southern Sampler' delicious!! The chargrilled oysters are must, even if you're ""not a fan"" of oysters. The entire staff was helpful and friendly. 
Abita beers on tap were good. Oyster shot was an interesting experience as well.  Will stop by before we leave again.  A must, when visiting New Orleans.",

That just tells you in itself what a great place is. Has the small white in medium. Should have gone mild because as amazing as it was I couldn't hang. The pimento Mac n cheese is absolute fire especially paired up with the baked beans. The coleslaw cooled me down and the sweet tea was my drink of choice the first two drink fill ups. So much food though I would have split it with my boyfriend if I had realized how much food it was. Priced great though, just so much food for the money! Definitely happy we stopped on our way through town.",,

Ordered the chargrilled oysters...11 out of 10 ...AMAZING! Seafood ettouffe added crawfish...(crawfish was fried... but still came out really good 8/10.  Seafood platter  , fried fish and shrimp.. 9/10, medium shrimp breaded & cooked perfectly, fish were thick, flaky filets. Fries were also good. Ordered hush puppy's.. seemed handmade and really good 8/10. Also had the fried oyster poboy...9/10, one of the best flavored I've had , loaded with oysters , topped with lettuce tomatoes, bread was really good.

There was a line outside, but I was only one person so I took a seat at the bar and got in pretty quick. The server was friendly and I got a nice view of the boys shucking oysters.

I started with half a dozen oysters on the half shell, which were fresh and delicious. I enjoyed a local, dark beer - not sure the name. And my entree was étouffée - so amazing that I have since tried to replicate it at home. After a long road trip, this savory pile of crawdaddy deliciousness was exactly what my body needed.

I never felt rushed and my bill was somewhere around $20 bucks, which I didn't think was so bad for a starter, beer and entree. If I swing through town again, I'll be back.",

There is no rhyme or reason to the wait and you are provided with zero explanation as to why it how long the wait will be. Once we were seated, Alisha was our waitress. She was great. She was friendly and fast. She was wonderful with pleasantries and made us feel welcome. Our food was excellent. There are zero complaints there, with the exception of some of the oysters. We had the charbroiled oysters, raw oysters, seafood etouffee, shrimp po'boy, and fried soft shell crab. Some of the oysters had a ton of shell with them and were really dirty, which always makes us for a bad eating experience. The rest of the food was really good though. The cocktails left something to be desired, but they did the trick!",

Djaa6J18tf-9lA9vV8md3w,Contrary to popular belief aka those who don't know any better this is not the best hot chicken in America but it is the place that inspired the guy who is responsible for making the best hot chicken in America. See my review for howlin rays for my info . This  was my second stop in my Nashville daycation  right after princes . I had to try them side by side to see which was better as these two places are constantly listed in the best of  hot chicken restaurant lists .  Hattie Bs wins overall at a 3.1 to princes 3.0 . See my other review for my details . Hattie Bs chicken is more complex but lacks something . Some would say brown sugar in their spice mixture . Or acidity and sweetness in the coleslaw they put on top of their chicken sandwich . Or could it be the sad  lifeless hamburger buns . Howlin rays spoiled me with brioche .   .Note-  I had originally given this place 3.4 stars but had to downgrade as while I was finishing my chicken sandwich today I realized the chicken was improperly cooked .,,
DjwLtrw7FAABoozcZJ4I0g,,,Nice fast service. I arrived was seated ordered a drink. Waitress was great told me the specials in great details and even offered recommendations. This was my second time visiting Oceana I think it was better the first time but still good.
DkZVO_swvuPzb8XILt7gQQ,,,"So... Why didn't they take any of chef ramsey's advice from when they were on kitchen nightmares?  I don't understand how they would be offered a diamond and slosh it around and toss it away. Crazy!!

Mo is a horrible person and owner. Rami has always been wonderful to me.  Kent(?) one of the managers, is really bad at his job and should move toward a different career. Tom, one of the managers, is excellent. 

Overall, with the exception of Rami,  I've seen the staff be horribly abused. It is difficult for me to support a company who treats my neighbors and fellow new Orleans residents like shit.  

The food is frozen... Simple fact. Nothing is fresh. Simple fact. You can taste the freezer burn. 

I hate giving any place a one star review, but the entire city knows what oceana is. Tourist trap...  We locals call it the ""slave ship""  

Its too bad because I live Rami and tom as leaders. But it is what it is. :-(

DlgEV_dallfaldATkJNlqQ,"Yep, it's HOT!!  And, oh so good! If you like spicy food, then you can't miss Hattie B's. You will wait in line, sometimes for a long time...but, it is worth it. Try going early for lunch or on a weekday evening to lessen the wait a bit. The tenders are great, the beer local, and the sides do the job. Whatever they put on the chicken to make it so tasty hot must contain some type of drug, because once you go, you start to crave it and have to go back.",,
Dm09OKwUPWJvonKLm5DoJw,"We really looked forward to trying out this place, since it came highly recommended from one of our family members. It was the first restaurant that we tried out as soon as we got to Tennessee. I didn't mind the long line and the online order system crash, because I was expecting the taste and flavors to compensate. After an hour of waiting, the taste was pretty disappointing. 
We ordered chicken tenders wings, and the quarter legs in all varying levels of heat. In addition, we tried each side order offered. All orders were edible with the exception of the coleslaw; unfortunately, each bite was a spoonful of salt. Overall, the chickens lack uniqueness; it was simply fried chickens. I wish I could describe the experience as a taste of deliciousness, where the skin is perfectly seasoned and crisp sealing the juicy meat in its own fatty oils. I also wish that I can say that I can discern the differences between McDonald's, KFC, or even Popeyes chicken from Hattie B's because of its distinct flavors, but I can't. Its ""Shut the Cluck Up!!"" heat level did have a kick to it, but again the meat was dry, almost burnt without the char nor crispness   taste.",,

We weren't able to make reservations, however, I was shocked to hear there was only a 10 minute wait, which only lasted about 5 minutes until we were seated.

Then was brought to a table on the third floor (place is huge to pack in as many people and tables as possible) where I was sat at a table that was put in a walkway so they could accommodate more people. I was bumped into by every passing waiter and service person as they walked by. This is also the walkway to the bathroom so as a bonus I get bumped into by each patron going to use the restroom as well. I wait another 20 minutes then the busser comes to apologize for the wait and offers to take our food order instead as the waiter is still MIA (Maybe on a break?) Not sure still haven't seen him. Meanwhile I see people who were sat after me already getting their food. Waiter finally arrived and is introduced to us by the busser who already took our food order. He says ""here is your waiter to take your order"" what? I thought you already took our order? Well he's here to verify it he said, so ok verify the order then... he does not verify the order just apologize that he wasn't around to take it. So Brandon the waiter brought the food; we had a large fried seafood shared platter and he had no plates in his hand for us but had two bags of to go food for someone else's table in his other hand for some reason.

We wouldn't have even gone here but options were low, it was around 3:30, we were hungry, and alot of restaurants were closed for shift change, or had a line out the door, so we settled.
The wait wasn't terrible, but we had to stand in front of a stinky alley way while we waited. The inside was dark, noisy and crowded. Staff was friendly enough, the hostess made me give her my drink I had brought in from another place I had been drinking while we stood in line.:P
We shared the Boo fries with roast beef gravy and cheese...nothing special, small serving of run of the mill fries with average tasting gravy and a sprinkle of cheddar cheese.
I got the fried catfish and shrimp with coleslaw and hushpuppies. There were bones in the catfish. The food was okay otherwise, I could've gotten the same where I live in Las Vegas.
The hubby got the Acme 10 napkin roast beef po boy. I think he only used 2 napkins. It was nothing special, more bread and gravy than meat. What a disappointment. 
We decided to stop eating and try a different restaurant in a few hours, I'm glad we did.",

I was going to have a talk with a manager but was informed by my server that because the food was cold  somehow the server would be blamed for it and that he would be made to pay for it. At first I found it hard to believe so I asked another server and it was confirmed. The dining room is also very dirty I waited in line for 45 minutes beside at a sticky table with mouse droppings in the corner of the floor by the table I was at. I should have believed the show Hell's kitchen I thought maybe they sold this place being so disgusting for ratings but it was factual. I wouldn't eat this place if it were free. Needless to say I didn't eat my meal paid my bill

There are two sides to pull into for curbside and it seems they forgot because they kept going to one and not the other, we were at ""the other"".

Tip - the back of the restaurant is self seating - so sometimes, I've just walked in, and walked myself to the back and plopped down on the first available seat instead of waiting for someone to hold me back from devouring all of fishies in the land.

My favorite item on the menu is obvi the crawfishies, the chargrilled oysters, and the gumbo. The gumbo is not my favoritest because it's not the spiciest, but it still hits the spot. The crawfishies and all the sides are a hit every damn time.",

This was our first night out in NOLA. We were excited! We waited for a table and the wait was about 20-30 minutes.

We sat near the bar. I could see everything, the TVs playing the basketball game, the bar, the oyster shucking station and all the tables. There was so much noise: talking, laughing, clattering of dirty plates behind the bar, and people dancing. 

We ordered: 2 Medleys (gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice + fried soft shell crab), 1 dozen chargrilled oysters, 1 large Ettoufee with fried crawfish tails, 1 Jambalaya, and 1 cup of chicken and Andouille Gumbo. 
Dessert: 1 bread pudding with scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

The Good:
The chargrilled oysters were buttered, garlicky and so plump and delicious! I loved it! We took the bread to sop up the sauce. 
One oyster had some sand. They weren't the best chargrilled oysters that we had in NOLA but they were a close 3rd. 

Protip: dip that bread daintily in the oyster sauce. Don't sop up a large amount of that sauce bc it is super salty!!

The fried soft shell crab was juicy, crispy and so light. The flavors were simple and the texture and cooking was well executed. 

The bread pudding was delicious! It was gooey, sweet and had a great flan texture. Even though we were stuffed from all the food, we still devoured the dessert.


The ok: Andouille sausage. It was grilled in the medley. It was a good sausage. The large ettouffee had a little bit of seafood. The fried crawfish tails added more seafood and a bit of texture.

The red beans were buttered and broken down. They were ok. 

The gumbo was a little salty and tasted nothing like what was made in the New Orleans Cooking School. 

I would definitely return to eat a plate of chargrilled oysters.

Dqb34bnL4dzwZvySx--qqQ,"Had to come check this place out based on all the amazing reviews. The line went out the door and down the sidewalk which is always a good sign. The total time from getting in line to getting our food was an hour and a half. Holy crap I thought it would move much faster than that. I thought the food was very delicious and I loved how juicy and tender the chicken was. The fries were also very crispy and seasoned just right. I admit this place is awesome, but not sure it's worth waiting 90 minutes for. I would try to come at odd hours for sure. Hopefully that will help you beat the extremely long wait.",,
Dqjl-5PzMl3gHHgTTPRF4A,,"[ Food: 4/5 ]    [ Ambiance: 3.5/5 ]    [ Services: 3.5/5 ]
Prices: $$ (average $15/person)

Expect to wait in line no matter what time of the day or day of the week. My advise, if you really like the slimy sea creature, then WAIT and be patience!

My partner and I decided to spend the weekend in NOLA for our first Mardi Gras celebration. We flew in by 8am and we had the whole day to spend. So, after a 2.5hrs ""breakfast"" at Cafe du Monde, we decided to have lunch here. It was about 12.30pm on Friday and the line already spilled out on the street, the wait was about 25mins average. NOTE: if you come as a couple and dont mind sitting at first available, then you get in sooner, there was 2 big groups (4 and more) in front of us that had to wait for over 45mins...

Anyway, back to the food... We were seated on the bar close to the entrance with 3 staff behind the counter shucking the oysters and serving at the same time. We started with a dozen raw $13.50 and within 5 mins, poof, those things just gone... My partner was not a fan but he actually enjoyed it, so we ended ordering another dozen. The ""homemade"" cocktail sauce really helps for those who dont like the fishy taste of it. In addition, we had half dozen of the chargrilled oyster $11.50, this is absolutely addictive and divine with lots of butter, garlic and herbs. We even soaked up the juices with the 3 pieces of bread... 

In addition, we tried a bowl of seafood gumbo $7.49 and a large shrimp ettouffee $12.99. Both were pretty generic and nothing to write about... 

The hype is true, ACME does serve up some of the best oyster in the city. We tried another place (Oceana Grill) and it just fall flat. So, if you skip the other dishes and just stick to the oysters (especially the raw & chargriled and thats were my 4 stars are given) and some Abita beer, then you are good to go...",
Dqwtljb6r0tqzc59iopoiQ,,,Good. Not great. In a city like this there are better choices. Back in my hometown this would be great.
DrMp6YF1Kc2J9dHK9W0eTA,"Stopped here for a late lunch, at about 3 pm and there was still a long line but it moved rather quick.  We got 2 hot chicken sandwiches and they were awesome, well worth the wait!  Sides were Mac and cheese which is the best I have ever had and my husband got the potato salad which also did not disappoint.  Don't miss this place!",,
DrXD1qFMThevJAec9fW8Dg,Flavor of chicken was really good but the wings are too big.... Tyrannosaurus!  I prefer small or regular sized wings.  Fries were fresh and hot.  Service was very good.,,

DsLkCuZO5frRlFV0XcFV6A,,,Went for dinner last week with friends.  No line.  I got the New Orleans sampler.  Good food.  Had a couple of beers.  Good beer.  Prices were reasonable.  Nice place.  Go here.
DsjGTJJTUTPiP6-EvwK4BA,The chicken is so amazing I came back two nights in a row! Whoever posted that you would crave it afterwards was so right! I figured if I was blowing my dirty might add well go all way with fries...Mac and cheese and a Porter. They just brought it to me and the smell is incredible! Come here or miss out on one of the best Nashville places.,,
Dskl9OHolbJoDuGpa8z9Aw,,"Oh WOW-- the char grilled oysters are delicious accompanied by a buttery, seasoned sauce and lovely, dipping bread with a great Bloody Mary to swoosh it down. 
My guy had the ""10 napkin"" beef sandwich with a side of fries and  called it a winner. The gumbo,  light fare and well made, is a kid's size portion in a cup. Everything was well worth the price of admission..which is zero except for the wait. A+ Bloody Mary. 
The staff was genuinely friendly..we'll be back next time in the French Quarter!
Highly and Funkily Recommend. Great music too.",
Dt3NXIcEELyqnWz3fSHi-Q,,,"this is the most reasonable place to eat and try New Orleans food. this place was recommended by the front desk clerk at our hotel. we were able to get a table in 5 minutes we order several appetizer and soup and a few entries so that we can taste and try all of the signature items.

we had Sara and she knew the menus and what was in in them.

I would be back next time I come. now we are going to walk the party street"
DtA7r0JRKAML9DhRO0kqgw,,"Sat by the bar, great view of the main event. Good service. Great chargrilled oysters. The local sampler was simply amazing! Good atmosphere and music selection. Touristy crowd that adds to the good vibe. The long line is definitely worth the wait.",
DtBn1LwwJSz6bXX9L1ExQw,"If you have this place on your Nashville itinerary go ahead and find a different place (The Row around the corner is actually 100x better than this place) it's not all that it's cracked up to be. I wasted almost 40 minutes of my life waiting in line for subpar fried chicken. I'm no fried chicken connoisseur but honestly y'all I think I've had better fried chicken at KFC... But if you do waste your time going there you HAVE to get the potato salad, mac and cheese, and lemonade those 3 are the only reasons I'd go back",,
DtQZP-MrOIpXX1qC_glwwQ,"Hattie B's was worth the 1 hour wait in line.  We had the chicken tenders with no heat, very tender and juicy. Our sides were potato salad, coleslaw, pimento Mac and cheese and grits. The food was great and very filling. The only downside is the long wait. One thing you can do is place a to go order, pick it up and eat it on the patio. That would save you the time in line!",,
DtRiipjfguip4twRv_8dFw,,,"I got the fried catfish platter. Overall the dish was pretty good. The catfish was nice and tender. The fries were lightly crispy. The jalapeno hush puppies were ok. Be careful because it is a LOT of food. It could have been split between 1.5 - 2 people and even with some others in my party taking some, I couldn't finish everything. Someone in my party got the alligator bites, half fried and half blackened. He said the fried were better than the blackened and liked them the best of the alligator bites he's gotten from 3 or 4 different restaurants over the past few days. The two people who got redfish dishes were both a little disappointed and thought the redfish was a bit dry.  Someone also got the blackened catfish and that was better than the redfish."

DuNFHtTJ7IoAaazwV7uRUw,Holy hot chicken - this place was so good! We got there early and didn't have to wait too long but when we left there was a line around the building. The line is fairly slow moving so I recommend getting there early! Medium was just spicy enough for me - some friends of mine got hot and they were struggling to finish it but still wanted to because it was so tasty. All of our sides were delicious as well! Definitely worth the wait to eat here,,
DuVLwzc-dKj1W-y1JOWYkA,I waited in line for about 40 minutes on a Friday night. Great prices. They're not lying when they say they can make them hot.,,
DuaaSXwVm02ZcI-EZR4Q8w,"Trusting the reviews, we headed down to try this foodie hotspot after a visit to the Parthenon and Vanderbilt. There is a line out the door to order but it is certainly worth the wait! We went with a group of friends and ordered plenty of dishes and shared everything family style. The hot chicken; light and dark meat were moist inside with a slight crunch to the outside. The outside is covered in a cayenne pepper sauce that simply enhances the taste of the chicken. We ordered some mild and some hot. I carefully stayed clear of the hot wings and chicken. Our friend who enjoys hot was definitely feeling the heat of the dish! Hoo HOT!  Thankfully we also ordered a pitcher of beer with our meal. The kids in the party loved the mild wings, French fries, and Mac and cheese. The greens were good but I found the cole slaw a bit too runny. Black eye peas were pretty good too. Only complaint is that I wish the sides were bigger portions . Wish we had a place like this in CA! I would go back on another visit.",,
DubwuPmdRMYzO6PbxJhHVQ,,,"Our group was rather large, but made a reservation well in advance. We still had to wait 20 minutes after our reservation time before being seated while people who showed up after us with no reservation were being seated almost immediately. It was a little frustrating. 

I should preface the food portion by saying I'm not a huge fan of seafood. I was with a large group of coworkers who mostly ordered seafood and they were all incredibly pleased with their food. 

I, on the other hand, ordered a blackened chicken po'boy. It was really excellent. The chicken was moist and flavorful. And the remoulade sauce was just spicy enough to take the sandwich to the next level. The french fries that came with it were good, but I wished I had known that I could get a Cesar salad on the side instead. 

I also tried fried alligator, which was surprisingly tasty. 

It took about 20 minutes for the check paying process, which seemed a little long."
DuwZ_C3ZncPtEtTWeEPFjw,"Super disappointed this round. I come to Nashville a few times a year and last time tried this place was great. This time it was pure disappointment, waited in 30 degree weather for almost and hour to get cold Mac n Cheese and chicken...not sure how that's even possible with the amount of people that come through here. I asked them for warm Mac n Cheese then to realize the leg/thigh was also cold but the breast was steaming? We gave up by ruining our mean to keep asking for items missing and to replace cold food which shouldn't be the case to begin with especially when people wait an HOUR to get the food. Our Nashville excitement has been a little less knowing we won't be returning anymore in a few months or tell others to try when they visit.",,
DvBEvRT5pwHlvRhQAiE0YQ,"My boyfriend & I were in town visiting & had heard hot chicken was the thing to try in Nashville. We both have a high tolerance for spice & have never found a restaurant that can challenge us. Thus we ordered our chicken in ""extra hot"" & ""shut the cluck up."" We sat down in their heated covered porch & naively dug in... Oh my goodness! This place does not joke about their spice. The chicken was delicious, but if I had to do it over again, I'd order the medium. Our mouths were on fire!

We also ordered a couple of sides & banana pudding - all delicious! The pudding helped put out the fire in my mouth.

We will always relive our adventure with Nashville's hot chicken. Thank you Hattie B's for making it a memorable one.",,
DvDuRlC4ssCRFP8RQKUQJw,,"The food was good, flavorful and fresh. The staff was fun and friendly, the prices were reasonable. It's super loud, super busy,lots of commotion. I would definitely go back but only if there was no wait, I don't think it's worth waiting 45 mins in line for.",

By the way, bananas foster is not supposed to be an ice cream cake. Might want to change the title/ description if you're going to have it on your menu. 
It was alright, but I'm going to continue to search for better vegetarian food in Louisiana."
Dvrr88xmhrcqtgU1LgPLZw,,"Acme, you've done it again. 

There are few things I hate more in life than lines. Even then - the moment we got to the French quarter I happily stood in the long lunch line at Acme, dreaming of the chargrilled oysters I'd eaten a year and a half ago.

My memory hadn't failed me - the chargrilled oysters were even more delicious than I remembered. If I can tell you one thing about Acme it's this - get the chargrilled oysters. They are one of the best things I've ever eaten. You're making a huge mistake if you come to New Orleans and don't eat this here.

Outside of that the other food we ordered (red beans and rice, sausage, peacemaker po boy, boo fries) was also delicious, but I wouldn't really expect any less.

The service is meh, but lets be honest, that's not why anyone comes here. I would legit come back to New Orleans just to have one more dozen chargrilled oysters.

Tip: if you want to reduce your potential wait time the best times to come are when it opens, or in the awkward time between lunch and dinner.",
DwTuHbQiAzmCKdf_fSmOsw,,"Best Charbroiled oysters ever!!! Great flavor, great customer service. a bit of a weight because of their popularity but I definitely recommend.",
DwYPFIqt4vA8c8PQYCVvDQ,,"Popular place with a fun vibe. 
Our group had the Louisiana Sampler, hot sausage patty po'boy, and oysters (both raw and charred). I'm not a fan of oysters but those in the group who are say these are the best in town. Po'boy was really good! Sampler arrived lukewarm but when we requested it to be warmed up it was cheerful well taken care of. 
Server was okay, place was busy. No time for real interaction.",
Dwb2M-lJtfekFGdymbefzA,"This is a customer service review...because obviously we all know the food is the best! 
We stopped by the restaurant just before closing and was looking the menu and people watching thru the door. The manager,  Michael, saw us and asked if he could help us. We explained we're just checking out the location and we'd be back another time. He suggested we come back Sunday (the next day) because its the only day they serve waffles.  He suggested as they only are open 11-4 to come early as the line is usually out the door, or order online or call him and place a take out order. We did. When we got there he came running out with our order because he said he thought that that order was us and he was right. He made the effort to come out and just to say hi and then run back in to the busy busy restaurant.  He is so nice and went out of his way to extra friendly and make us feel special! THANK YOU MICHAEL!",,
DwmrbbSnusVlbs11qmn5Ew,,,"Great atmosphere and the food everything was delicious. The must try's are the blackened alligator bites, the shrimp Jambalaya Alfredo.

Seafood platter was goood but I wasn't blown away... the seafood gumbo was pretty bland my mom asked for extra seasoning but then it was a little salty, she said the seafood gumbo at at the French market was better (nawlins)."
DxYatM2mTXdjdZDkghSz4w,"Hattie B's makes great hot fried chicken.  I have been their a half dozen times so far and their chicken is consistently good.  The best compliment I can have for a restaurant is that after the meal, I want another plate.  This is definitely the case for Hattie B's.  I love the taste of the chicken skin and the fact that there is a slight sweetness to it.  Their sides are outstanding as well, but the black eye pea and pimento macaroni and cheese are my favorites.  I consider myself to have a high tolerance for spicy foods.  Hot is perfect for me but has caused my less tolerant companions to run through several cups of lemonade.  I've had damn hot once and was probably at my limit of spiciness.  I've never had the shut the cluck up level of hotness (one step higher than damn hot), and to be honest with you, I'm afraid to try. :)",,
DxnohHllLwDUdmLs1jCM5w,"The food is very good. The menu is very simple. The service is friendly and helpful. The prices are very fair. The fried chicken is excellent. The various levels of heat are good and adequately described on the menu. The greens are fabulous. The cole slaw is very good. The pimento macaroni and cheese is very pleasantly creamy but could use a more flavorful cheese.

note: There is no option here for a vegetarian or a ""gluten free"" person.",,
DxufGL53YG8G4UDjJpnqgQ,,"Food is amazing! One of the top two places we ate during our 5 days here. The line outside was long but they have a list at the door so make sure to walk up and put your name on it. I didn't give it 5 stars because once we were seated we had to wait another 30 plus minutes to get drinks and place our order but once the food arrived no one said a word and ate every bit of it from the soft shell crab, oysters, fried shrimp, fried catfish and po-boys! Hush puppies we're also amazing. Definitely a must go when in NOLA!",
Dy3z-USsyaCpmqjbwfhC3Q,,So yummy. Showed up 10 min before closing. Had a dozen raw oysters that were so meaty and delicious. The chargrilled were all sold out. We will have to come back for that. Had the fried alligator that tasted amazing. Like a cross between chicken flavor but catfish texture. Lol. The hush puppies were a little sweet with little corn pieces on the outside. The New Orleans medley was good too but the red beans and rice were the best part of the medley!,

Word of advice make online reservation! We did and zipped right past the long line waiting to be seated!"
DzLb4V2g-KqSWN2VsDL5NQ,"We were lucky enough to beat the line before it got crazy on a Saturday night! We ordered our meal ahead of time and it was ready as soon as we arrived. TIP: If you place a take out order but want to sit and eat it at the restaurant you can sit at the bar tops outside on the edge! We ordered the hot chicken and fries which surpassed high expectations. My boyfriend and I like spicy food and the chicken was HOT but bearable. The box was enough for the two of us. As we sat down at the bar top, we saw the line begin to form. After being there for 30 minutes the line wrapped around the building.

I definitely wouldn't rate it worth a hour wait though. The southern style which comes with no heat also comes with little flavor at all. Sides were pretty good.",,

We also had the crab cake appetizer.  There were2 good size crab cakes.  Most thought they were very good; I was les impressed, rating them good.

We also shared the fried seafood platter - shrimps, cat fish, alligator sausage and hush puppies.  This was very good.  Not even a little greasy and a large portion

We sat at a table in the bar section.  They're very small and on top of each other.  Our server, Lloyd, the bus boy Frank and the food runners were really great.  Excellent service.

check with your bell captain.  There are10% discount coupons around."

Got the medium tenders, which were quite mild, but friend got the damn hot and was struggling like it was... damn hot. Black eyed peas were the best side I've had yet. Only complaint was the incredibly long wait both in line to order, and afterward. Seemed like they forgot my order somewhere in the chaos; it arrived right after I asked for its status.

Once inside we ordered got a table number and sat down.  It only took 15 minutes before our food arrived. Wow So worth the wait.  We are from Buffalo and know what good wings taste like.

A great way to end the night with some food in your belly after day drinking. If you like spicy and don't want to regret it, just get the ""hot"". If you want to regret it get the ""shut the cluck up."" Awesome experience and it lives up to the hype. I did notice the line is crazy long at lunch.",,

E0D1HoZ6UfUixKWz1wZEFQ,,,We ate dinner our first night in NOLA at this place. The food was pretty good but the red beans and rice?! OMFG they were delicious! We ordered a side of them to take back to our hotel room. The entire waitstaff was amazing. When we come back I would love to check them out for breakfast.
E0QdFzdqZOlMJs0nv5X36g,"Yep, the thousands of people that already reviewed Hattie's aren't wrong: The chicken here is amazing. My lady and I were in town for the Bon Jovi concert, so we wanted to try some local favorites. We walked by the place Friday night, but didn't want to wait in line. So we waited in line for an hour Saturday morning. In the on/off rain and chill.

We both got small white (a breast with attached wing) plate. I had fries and the pimento mac-n-cheese, she got the mac-n-cheese and baked beans.  I opted for whatever level of spicy is one down from the ""Evil Mother Clucker"" (or whatever it was called).  I've got to say that I love hot stuff.  I ferment my own habanero sauce and eat a lot of spicy food...but I don't think that I could eat the hottest Hattie's chicken in public.  My nose was running, my eyes were sprouting rivulets of tears, and my face was code red scarlet with the level that I did get.  Keep that in mind.  And, if you possess external genitals, wash your fingers carefully with soap and water before peeing, because I didn't and had to walk around feeling like my junk was about a half-second away from spontaneous combustion.  That sensation didn't disappear for a couple of hours.  Caveat emptor, etc.

The chicken breasts were huge, tender, and really juicy.  The skin on the outside was crispy and flavorful.  It sounds clichéd, after reading other reviews, but this really is in the top three best fried chicken that I've ever had.  Worth the wait?  The first time, yeah.  I wouldn't wait again, but I would order delivery from one of the several services that do that from Hattie's.

The sides were thoroughly mediocre and forgettable.  French fries were overdone, the pimento mac-n-cheese was soupy.  But the name of the place has ""chicken"" in it, not ""sides"".  Still, it would be an easy five stars if the sides didn't suck.

Good beer selection.  Bathrooms are in the worst place available, logistically.  If you're in line inside, you'll have to shuffle around to make room for people to get into/out of the loo.  But...great experience and excellent chicken!",,
E0fG15nooadD2pqD1sERAA,,"This place lives up to the fame.  Even though the line is long, the oysters and food are totally worth it!  I never used to like oysters, but I've fully converted now to absolutely loving them.

Raw Oysters- fresh and flavorful with perfect spicy horseradish topping.  They just go so quickly, one after another. MMMMmh

Chargrilled Oysters- savory cheesy garlicky flavorful.  I dip my bread in the leftover juices in attempts to get every last bite.

This place gets a 5/5 because I'm seriously considering coming back and I was just there 5 nights ago!",

The shrimp appetizer is delish- even better when you add a little buffalo sauce. Oysters were great, they used a tad more salt than usual. PoBoys were good, somewhat dry- add the mayo. Prickly pear mojitos were great. The dessert looked good also (banana foster cheesecake and bread pudding)",
E2Zy2dIaBzR1CoAVb5j0eQ,,"I'm not even a big fan of oysters, but my friends love it. My friend that I went to Mardi Gras with can live off of it. There was a big hype on the chargrilled oysters here so she had to try it. The hype can be validated, they are that good. My other friend that doesn't like oysters at all ate half a dozen herself. It was so good that we went here twice during our trip, just for that very item. The red beans with rice and boo fries (french fries drenched with housemade gravy on top) were both very good too.",
E2bYIFg49_1QCnYUF0O9wQ,,,"Much better seafood in NOLA, BBQ shrimp were damn good though.  Crab cakes were also delicious and had a crawfish reduction sauce on top.  Service was great as well."
E2seWkB-aCJmRriEMe3SDA,,The oysters were amazing. You really can't go wrong with ordering those at the Acme.  We also had sown crawfish and those were equally tasty. I was underwhelmed with the rest of the menu. Service was fine and we had a group of 10 that were seated within 30 minutes on a Tuesday night around 630. I would recommend this place but mostly for the oysters.,
E3GYQDsINnzctXaKe078uw,,"Acme doesn't take reservations so prepare for a long wait during dinner hours. We came by at 9:30pm and there was still a long line/wait outside. The restaurant technically closes at 10pm but they will seat you if you're in line before 10pm.  

Very causal place with weird dim red lighting. Our food came out pretty quickly. We ordered an assortment of seafood but the one item that truly stood out was the chargrilled oysters. I can't stand raw oysters due to the slimy texture and taste but the chargrilled oysters were on point. I found myself grabbing another one which never happens with oysters.",

I dont even like oysters and it was good.  had the combo where I got jambalaya, beans, and gumbo... maybe its because i'm from CA but this stuff was the best I've ever had and you have to get the fried crab claws... delicious !!!  I can't wait to go here again... it was just helllllla  good",
E3ag9od5fD69svzwBH61ww,,"My husband coaxed our family of 6 to wait in line for 30 minutes for lunch here on our first full-day in New Orleans.  It was HOT.  I was thirsty and sweaty, and the kids looked like voodoo zombies.  But I was glad we stuck it out, because when we were escorted to our table, the air conditioning and cold Abita beer revived me instantly.  We all dug into the chargrilled oysters [we loved watching them cook them], and I enjoyed my peacemaker po' boy--1/2 fried shrimp, 1/2 fried oysters, dressed with Tabasco-mayo.  I wish Acme had a children's menu--it was a little challenging trying to get the kids fed here, and it seems like it would be easy enough to add some reasonably-priced, kid-sized portions of fried seafood, etc., but our server was very helpful, offering us plenty of suggestions on how folks typically cobble together kid's meals by splitting entrees, ordering a shrimp po' boy without bread, etc.  Long live Acme.",
E3e7kB-ZhiiX2RIF2zolYw,,,In town for the weekend and came across this place! Wow the crab cakes are OUT OF THIS WORLD! Our server Errol was THE MAN and gave us great food suggestions! You won't be disappointed!

We've eaten hot chicken around town and of the big 3: Boltons, Prince's and Hattie B's, Hattie's wins. As much as I think of Prince's as the gold standard, at the end of the day, Hattie's is as close as it gets, with lots of seating, cold beer and takes credit cards. Not to mention, in the Summer we walk across the street to Bobbie's for dessert. The sides are quite good too! The black eyed pea salad, red skin potato salad and pimento mac and cheese are great choices over a typical slaw.",,

Kim is awesome, we were originally sat near the back next to the kitchen and it was really hot and Kim greeted us and moved us to another table that was very comfortable. She was over and beyond friendly. We ordered oysters Rockefeller and Oceana oysters and fried eggplant sticks. Everything was amazing! We went I. Knowing that we loved oysters Rockefeller but we discovered that we loved the Oceana oysters the best. Garlicky cheesy goodness. The friend eggplant was perfect also. The manager even came by the table to see how we were doing.  Perfect dining experience and the prices were fair as well. We will be back before we leave!"

A NOLA NATIVE'S RANKING OF FRENCH QUARTER SEAFOOD-ERIES:

1.  GW FINS - only open for dinner so no bargains, but the finest dining alternative;
2.  FELIX'S - better than Acme and no lines; fortuitously it's across the street;
3.  DESIRE - affordable, classic Vieux Carré atmosphere, old school wait staff;
4.  RED FISH - lunch Prix Fixes less than $20, Brennan's quality, healthy choices;
5.  CAFÉ SOULÉ - specializes in crab dishes, Antoine's family, classic atmosphere;
6.  DEANIE'S - if you want a menu heavy on fried... uh... everything, huge portions;
7.  MRB - if you can handle bar smoke the oyster & crawfish specials are a deal;
8.  ROYAL HOUSE - best atmosphere, outdoor seating, but touristy & a tad pricey;

DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN BEST & WORST: 9. New Orleans Hamburger & Seafood (a citywide chain; and that should tell you something about the bottom six!)

10.  BOURBON HOUSE - good lunch prix fixe but the oysters are lame;
11.  ACME - our classic oyster bar, but I'm a New Orlenian & don't wait in queue;
12.  OCEANA - nasty dining room, wide but insipid menu, gougingly overpriced;
13.  PIER 424 - ultimate tourist trap on Bourbon, you can do so much better;
14.  RALPH & KACOOS - buses disgorge snowbirds here;
15.  (& Dead Last):  COOP'S - there is absolutely nothing good to be said about it...","A-OKAY, BUT NOT WORTH WAITING IN LINE FOR
2,073 reviews for Oceana and I bet, like Acme, 90% queued for a table. Sure the efficient staff are friendly and prices are moderate but the seafood is just average (pic). Opt for these comparable nearby alternatives if you can't get seated:

1. ""Desire"" - affordable, classic tile and panel Creole café, career employees, sit at the shucker bar;
2. ""MRB's""- a neighborhood favorite, bar food with excellent char-grilled oysters;
3. ""Deanie's"" - Applebeesish, reasonably priced adequate seafood;
4. ""New Orleans Hamburger & Seafood"" - kid friendly local chain, get the garlic fries;
5. ""Royal House"" - seafood's a tad over priced, sit on the romantic balcony.
And if someone else is paying:
6. ""GW Fins""; or if lucky
7. ""Pêche"".

REGARDLESS, REFUSE TO SIT IN THE REAR!
Don't let them entomb you in their claustrophobic back room. If you are going to wait an hour for a table you should hold out for the main dining area.

The raw oysters were fresh and chargrilled oysters were delicious.  The reason I only gave 4 stars was because they didn't have mint for my Mojito.  Otherwise it would be perfect 5 stars score.",
E4EFaCOX6lvnZrcrcSgqVQ,"Chicken and waffles, please - I don't mean to oversimplify here but if you're craving fried chicken, waffles, and maple syrup, then grab a Lyft (everywhere now in nashville) and head straight to Hattie B's.  Half a chicken, half a waffle, and a whole lot of I'm-not-going-to-eat-anything-for-the-rest-of-the-afternoon.

Watch out for the spice - because the ""damn hot"" has a good chance of making it too painful to enjoy your entire meal.  It's also totally fine to go with the ""southern"" aka no heat option, or maybe go halfsies with a friend so that you can alternate between spicy and relaxing.

Line tends to get long on weekends, especially in the late late morning / afternoon once nearby Vanderbilt students start to wake up.",,

E4oTk0GeZFYVcjCNnemRQA,"The line for this place was insane! It was literally out the door and down the block. My husband and I ended up waiting about an hour and 10 minutes. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely! The chicken seasoning was like nothing that I have ever tasted. It was sweet, spicy, and salty all in one. The texture and color of the chicken was completely different than what we are used to having in Texas. The color of the chicken had an almost overcooked look to it due to the red/brown hue to it. I imagined that the chicken would be overly greasy due to the shinny appearance but it wasn't. It also wasn't overly crispy either. It was juicy and very flavorful. I'm not going to lie, I was having second doubts after looking at pictures of the food while waiting in line. The pictures don't do it justice! I'm so glad that we toughed it out and waited. 

Overall, they have some damn good hot chicken! I would definitely like to come back if I ever make it back to Nashville. I would try to avoid the weekend crowd by going during an off (not lunch or dinner time) hour on a week day next time.",,

A minimum of 2 hours will cost you $12. Luckily we were ordering after about 30 minutes of waiting. You can avoid the line altogether by ordering ahead online, but my understanding is that there is a $4 fee. One last deciding factor is that if you choose to dine in, there is a slight chance of finding seating right away, but the patrons seem to understand and are mindful of that so they digest their food on the go rather than sitting and socializing.",,

I went with the Taste of New Orleans but substituted the jambalaya for anextra bowl of gumbo. The gumbo was pretty good but not the best I've had. I didn't care for the crawfish etoufee. 

We got patron shots which said $7 on the menu but they charged us $8. We got it rectified but that took over 20 minutes."
E7dNhALfxoE5OcH0ybH0Sw,,"This Is the first place I went to in New Orleans. It was about 6 pm when we got there and by some miracle we got in line and only had to wait 20 minutes. Literally five minutes later the line had quadrupled in size and the wait had stretched to at least an hour and a half. Lucky us :). I would describe the restaurant atmosphere as loud and boisterous.  Checkered table cloths and the loud buzz of conversation helped give it a TGIF/sports bar feel. You can be seated with random people so it can be a pleasant or not so pleasant depending on wether you are drunk or not. lol. I ordered the Jambalaya and a half dozen chargrilled oysters. Both Were $9.99 per dish. Wasnt impressed with the jambalaya, because it wasnt anything special. I dont know if I was hoping for authentic cajun cuisine or what but it felt/tasted average and microwaved to a suitable temperature. The chargrilled oysters however, were delicious. Burning hot Oysters, smothered in buttery garlic perfection. We didnt buy any alcoholic drinks because they didnt have any specials or prices comparable to bourbon street's, so we figured we'd wait.Read a lot of good reviews about here but I guess it got over hyped for me. Not bad by any means, but I did not have  a five star experience . Have fun yelpers!",

I ate so fast I forgot to take a picture, but ordered the redfish (blackened) that came with etouffee, collards, and jambalaya on the side. Also ordered a Hurricane. It was AMAZING!! Line was out the door so make reservations ahead! Seating is also beautiful in the courtyard area...very romantic."
E7fGiZqZ-8dLOEZJsIeNfA,,,So I ate here last night with my boss . It was just average in our opinion especially for New Orleans . The food was good but average and the Mojito and Margarita were a little disappointing we left and found a place with better drinks . Giving it a 3 rating at best
E7gXkaRbyzWLCwtOWRpESA,,Amazing!!! Don't be scared by the line - it moves fast! Place doesn't look fancy but the chargrilled oysters - OMG!!! We should have ordered two dozens instead of one! When I'm back to Orleans - that's the first place I will go again),
E7n8raOKyTChbSdEq305GQ,"The wait is not worth it.  I really just wanted to get that out of the way before I write this review.  When I arrived to Hattie B's I saw a huge line and was told it would take about an hour and a half to get to the front of the line, and they didn't lie.  Where they did lie was saying it would be worth the wait, which it was not.  This is the only hot chicken place in Nashville I have been to, so I can't tell you if other places are better, but I would think for the wait at Hattie B's you could find chicken just as good with a  shorter line.

I ordered a 3 piece dark meat (medium spice level) with french fries, mac and cheese, and baked beans.  I have had Nashville hot chicken before, in St. Louis (See my review of Southern) and I thought that the chicken was delicious, well spiced, and had a ton of flavor.  The chicken at Hattie B's had one flavor, spice.  There was no other discernible flavor to the chicken besides that.  I will say that the chicken was perfectly crispy and the meat was extremely moist, but the flavor was lacking.  Now the sides were pretty good, the baked beans had a nice balance between sweet and salty flavors.  The french fries were well seasoned (I wish the chicken had been as well seasoned as the fries) and were really crispy.  The mac and cheese might have been good, if not for it coming out room temperature.

I would say go find somewhere else to get hot chicken, especially if there is a huge line.  With this being Nashville's signature dish there has to be other options that are just as good and won't require half of your day.",,
E7wEEl2Yhs7TySjRG6v4gg,,The best oysters i have ever had... Chargrilled was my fave... The fried was great to... & my bf loved the raw ones! Must try while strolling down bourbon st!,
E8I8rtcnREL_34eBIdJJvw,"Hattie B's is a Nashville icon for a good reason, their fried chicken is some of the best in the country.  It's juicy, tender, with an excellent coating.  Available at variable levels of spice from none (Southern) all the way to ""shut the Cluck up"" the spice is not just in the breading but permeates the chicken itself.  I had the 1/2 bird at ""hot"" which I found to be just moderate in Scoville levels.  My spouse had the ""large white"" Southern (no spice) comprised of two breasts and two wings.  Two caveats, the chicken comes in quarters, not individual pieces, and I found the skin to be not well attached to the flesh of the chicken pieces.  It really doesn't matter, as the chicken tastes so succulent.  Just put the fallen skin back on the piece of chicken flesh and crunch away!  Smaller plates are available, such as ""small white"" ( a white quarter) and ""small dark"" (you get the idea).

Each plate comes with a choice of two sides, such as excellent crinkle cut french fries, a rather bland red potato salad, a slightly overly sweet cole slaw, a vinegary but nice black eyed peas salad, or (untried) southern greens.  

There is often a line of people waiting out the door, and seating is limited, but you place your order, get a number, and usually before your order is ready, you can find a table.  Napkins are paper towels from a holder on the table, and hot sauce, ketchup, and salt/pepper also sit on the table.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  Beer in bottles or on tap , tea, sodas, and lemonade are available.  

We had dessert based on some of the reviews, and I agree that the banana pudding was nice (vanilla pudding with bananas and a little crust.  The peach cobbler was warm, just OK, a little too sweet for me.

Go to Hattie B's for the chicken, the caveats are incidental.  You get good value and you won't be disappointed.",,

E9F8V_jgFZCZScvQ_Odt3w,"Years ago, Hattie B's was one of the first Nashville restaurants I visited before moving to town. I can't lie...it helped lure me to the city.

Since then, I've been numerous times. My go-to has been the always dependable chicken tenders.

For heat levels, I've tried everything from medium to ""damn hot."" The latter was a bit too hot for my liking. The medium was a bit too mild. However, unless you're a spicy food aficionado, I recommend starting with the medium level for a baseline.

The chicken is greasy. It's coated in a shiny, red-hot glaze of a delicious mix of peppery spices. The chicken itself is tender, juicy and flavorful. While some hot chicken establishments vary in their chicken quality and the level of heat in each piece of chicken, Hattie B's is always consistent.

The slice of bread under the chicken soon becomes full of the spicy drippings that fall off the chicken. By the time you reach it, the bread will be nearly as red as the chicken.

I haven't had a bad side at Hattie B's. I typically opt for the fries, but the mac and cheese is another favorite. But sometimes, I just stick with the chicken. The tenders are large and will fill you up quickly.

I always tell people to place your order online or via phone ahead of time to avoid the long lines. But rest assured, the long wait will be worth this delicious Nashville hot chicken.",,"Wow. I was hesitant about choosing a place so close to Bourbon Street, but my gamble paid off -- Oceana Grill was amazing. The wait (outside) wasn't too bad. As soon as we got inside, we were seated.

I ordered the chicken alfredo pasta. This is a dish that's easy to mess up. But Oceana did it justice. The lightly breaded chicken was juicy and flavorful. The linguine pasta absorbed the deliciously spicy alfredo sauce. The small slices of bread made for a wonderful accompaniment to the dish.

We managed to make room for two desserts: the bread pudding and the pecan pie. Both were amazing. Both were warm, sweet and full of flavor!

The service was great and the interior decor was authentic and very true to the French Quarter. Everyone in my party loved what they ordered, so we'll definitely be back."

I got an omelet with Tasso ham, cheese, mushrooms, peppers, onions and it was SUPER GOOD!! It came with hash browns which were really good and different. I guess it was like a different texture. Not crispy and not soggy either. I have never had Tasso ham before and it made the omelet taste so freakin good. If I ever go back to NOLA I will definitely stop by here again."

I like spice and can handle some heat, but let me tell you the ""damn hot"" heat level is just that. Chicken is juicy, not dry at all. I really enjoyed the sides. Between my husband and I we had pimento Mac and cheese (both had to have that), greens, and baked beans. The biggest surprise for me was the baked beans. I don't even care for them typically, but Hattie B's puts something in theirs that makes them interesting and delicious. I asked a staff member what was in there and she gave a rueful smile and claimed she didn't know. Wish I could have figured it out because I would make them at home.

EDZoYgqg0M3Rd65MUtCAoA,,,"Came here at the recommendation of the hotel staff.  It was offered as an alternative to some other popular restaurants. The place is quaint and rustic and a lively atmosphere. 

The wait staff and the host were very friendly.

It was a table of three and we ordered the seafood platter. We split the meal because we didnt want to be stuffed. It was sufficient for two. 

The food came out quickly and was hot. However the flavor had something to be desired. Compared to other popular restaurants in this area we had to give it the three stars

I'm not saying I would not come back but it would not be on my top 10 list of places in the French Quarters."
EDpvg_KnT9qRVRQeEBaX9A,"When we arrived there was a line around the building.  With good reviews and all those people lined up waiting we were expecting something great.  But my friends it is JUST FRIED CHICKEN nothing more nothing less.  The sides were good but nothing great.  In the end was the food good, yea it was good but worth waiting more than an hour for, no way.  If you don't mind waisting an hour or more of your day for fired chicken go for it, but on the other hand I expect there are more far worthier food venues in Nashville.",,
EDvgEkTv-vrNysPGYyGl4A,,,"got some authentic food here. definitely enjoyed it for a first time trip to nola. staff was very friendly and we got seated within 10 mns even on a thursday night. i got bbq shrimp, cole slaw, and garlic mashed potatoes-- all was amazing. and the frozen passion fruit margarita was VERY good. restaurant was very spacious and the location is great (a 30 second walk from bourbon street). i will definitely come back here on my next trip to nola!"
EE9LmOOZL3kwThi5sBJatQ,,,Good service poor food. A run of the mill standard cajun food poorly executed and over priced. The service was friendly and accommodating
EEHfRJ3l01N8M9eplEhhmw,,"Mandatory if you come to NOLA. So, you have a discerning palate? Come here. You don't have that much money? Come here. You already have reservations for somewhere else later? Come here. Your sobriety is questionable? Come here. 

Chargrilled Oysters. In my opinion, you don't really need to try anything else. I can and have eaten a dozen of them, which is embarassing because they're huge, and I'm a small lady (or I was at the time). All people who claim the raw oysters are better, I raise you a plate of these babies. Don't tell me that swallowing a slimy booger with some sauce is better than biting down on one (or 12) of these savory treats. 

Tips - try their local beer, and throw the hickory Tabasco sauce on the chargrilled oysters, it's speech-impairing good.",
EEJZi7OjIY21ec-KXDa15Q,,"Deep fried Crab claws - the best thing we had at the table.

We all ordered deep friend fish:
Catfish
Shrimp
Clams
Soft Shell Crab

But the winner out of all of these were the crab claws. Perfectly tender - came right off of the claw, and you just wanted to reach back and get another one.

Oh, we also had some of those oysters. 
YOU MUST TRY A CHARGRILLED OYSTER. I don't eat oysters, never have - but even I found them to be delicious.

Who goes to Acme?
Fans of the deep frier - and also people who like to eat oysters (but i think that's pretty obvious from the restaurant's name)

Who avoids Acme?
People who don't like to wait (yes LONG LINES), and people who are trying to avoid fried foods...if this is you - why are you in New Orleans?","We stopped at Oceana Grill because a friend had come here for Crab Cakes once, and he had to have them again.

I will say, they had some damn tasty crab cakes.
the service was very good - but it was labor day, around 12pm - was anyone really awake at that time?
Didn't try much of anything else  so my review will be limited to this."

I couldn't finish everything I wanted to but whatever I did have, definitely rocked my palate. When you order ""medium"" spice, it IS spicy. It's spicy enough to enjoy your meal while still getting kicked in the mouth. I'd give it 5 stars if I hadn't needed to take an antacid after 
Comes with bread and a pickle, and definitely felt like I was getting a good southern food experience. The chicken is like no other. Best fried chicken I've had thus far - and I've had a lot of chicken. I enjoyed the extra sauce they had on the side so much-- ASK for the side of their house sauce!! 
I'd come here again :)",,

But seriously, this unassuming restaurant (from the outside) had better food than the five star restaurants we visited during our trip to New Orleans.  We went there for breakfast, and one person in our party jokingly complained that the crab cakes had too much crab in them.  We loved this restaurant so much that we came back for dinner! The fact that they are open until 1 or 2 am is a plus!!!"
EG-8yQvN1fe0AiwImjjsxw,,"The Acme Oyster House is one of the best restaurants you have to check out while in the French Quarter of New Orleans! At first, there was a long line around 5pm, but luckily we ended up not waiting very long at all. You can order fresh crawfish, even though I don't remember specifically seeing that on the menu. Ordered the Chargrilled Oysters and that ended up becoming my favorite dish. The butter and cheese melt on them were delicious, even if you are not normally a fan of oysters. The restaurant is high energy, and everyone goes there for larger parties and lots of fun! The bar and great authentic southern food makes it even better.",
EGD7IQGQHlHk6-HV9P6biQ,,,"Our first restaurant stop in New Orleans. I LOVE this place! We had a late night arrival on the first day and found Oceana Grill near Bourbon St. Oceana opens late!  During my one week stay here, I probably ate here twice that's how good this place is.

The platters I've tried were chefs specials and they were sooo good and savory. The portions are huge that you can share a dish with one person. 

I highly recommend to give this restaurant a try if it's your first time. The restaurant did an exceptional job with their amazing customer service and safety covid protocols. Menu were scanned via QR code and tables were socially distanced. Check it out!"

If you really want to save some time order online and pick it up to eat somewhere else.  Lots of other places specialize in hot chicken and could be considered more ""original.""  However, each one's hot chicken as a bit different cooking style and recipe.  Hattie B's is more of a liquid dripping sauce kind of burn.  Unlike other places they also have good sides and a nice selection of drinks and beer to go along with the chicken.  If you haven't had Nashville hot chicken before start at ""mild"" or lower then build up from there if you can handle it.  This isn't yankee hot it is sweat in wintertime hot.",,

This is a fun place with good service and a party atmosphere. However I'm not sure why it's on every tourists agenda and a long line out the front door. 

Good fresh oysters. Chicken sausage gumbo was good. Jambalaya was yummy. Baked oysters were also good as well as the red beans and rice. Quality, good tasting food.",
EIRBAYXCV3647N3ejEwkIA,,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in New Orleans!

There is always a long line out the door! There were only two people in my party, so I only had to wait for 5 mins. It was awesome. They have a lot of two top tables at the restaurant so I would recommend not coming here with a large party unless you don't mind waiting for a long time.

We ordered their famous char-grilled oysters, fresh oysters, 1/2 fried fish and shrimp with fries, shrimp etouffee with fried crawfish tails on the side! 

Char-grilled oysters - this was sooo good! It comes with a couple of pieces of bread which we dump the bread into the sauce. Delicious! If you love cheese, give this a try. 

Fresh oysters - it didn't have that ocean taste, which I like. I highly recommend, really fresh!

1/2 fried fish/shrimp - We really enjoyed the fried fish. It was battered in cornmeal I think and it didn't taste greasy at all. My friend said it was the best fried fish she ever tasted. We also liked the fried shrimp as well. We did not care for the french fries (meh).

shrimp etouffee with fried crawfish tails - the fried crawfish tails were optional and it cost a few bucks more to add them. Overall, we really liked the dish, there were a lot of shrimp in the dish and was flavorful. I wouldn't add the fried crawfish tails as I didn't think the dish really needed it.

We had really good service, our waters were always full and the waiter was attentive.",
EJ8raOqUEgnq_lzs-883eg,"After the 50 minute wait in line outside,  we finally were served our hot chicken.  Two words, worth it. We both got the HOT shove level,  and I thought it was fine, not too hot,  but left a little burn. My husband wants to get hotter next time! The sides were great too. And the banana pudding!!!! So,  don't let the line scare you,  it moves quick,  you can order a beer while you wait, and they have water outside.",,
EJFxA4CtIJlKQnV0zdd1DQ,,,"What a great surprise.  After others in my group did tons of research to find the best places to eat  I found this place on a forum where someone spoke about their recent trip.  Plus, it didn't hurt that you could find a $50off certificate for $10 online.

Conveniently located in the French quarter and there was no wait to be seated on a Thurs night.  Started with the oysters and crabcakes both of which were delicious.  I went with the fried seafood platter which was also good and my friends went with the Grilled Tuna ""La Boheme"" with barbecue shrimp.  The waitress was extremely nice and quickly brought us over our free refills.  

After hearing about all the other restaurants we just had to try while in New Orleans and all the specialty foods we had to taste, Oceana was one of the best at a fraction of the price.  

Would highly recommend without the certificate but with it, I say Run to Oceana!"
EJLrd-4XYiuIs5zpH7Q-Zw,"Two things: 1.) long line 2.) absolutely worth it.  If you care about spice or the lack of it, this is the place for you.  Watch out for the ""shut the cluck up"" level of heat however, it's name speaks for itself.",,

EJPBXvEdaodsPQuYBT6low,,,"We had great service from a nice chap named Errol. The decor was comfy and classy and the second floor overlooked the madness of Bourbon Street during Mardi Gras. 

However the food was only so-so. I'd compare it to chains like Applebees and TGIF with a cajun twist. The crab cakes at $16.50 were so so. The oysters weren't the freshest. The jambalaya pasta was also just average, The pecan pie seems store bought. Overall the prices weren't too bad, All this and a coke of $58. Not the worst deal but not high end cuisine. With s many options in NOLA I would not go back

(Check out my plate in the picture because there was way more) You get soo much for your money! My husband got the blackened chicken with jambalaya. His plate was cleared in no time(so yummy)

Damarcus was our waiter. I can honestly say, even if we had to pay double for each plate. His hospitality and the customer service he showed would have been worth it! 

This should deff be a spot to visit whenever in town. The atmosphere is perfect for everyone. ( Family friendly) 

I like to think I am a tough person to please esp when it comes to a good meal & completing reviews So I assure you, nothing to complain about when it comes to this place."
EK9hrg3OVV9KS6qLbMFvsg,,,"NOT AUTHENTIC-NOT THE PLACE TO GET INTRODUCED TO CREOLE OR CAJUN FOOD -NOT LOCALS - THE OWNERS ARE NOT CREOLE OR CAJUN AND they do NOT represent OUR culture. FAKE

If I could give this place 1/2 a star, that would be the score. I am born and raised in New Orleans and although this PLACE has been around a long time, the OWNERS are not the original family who has owned it since it started but they never say that they continue to pretend they are the real deal.  I do not know where the current owners were born but I do know it was not in New Orleans or even in the United States.  

Creole and Cajun food are DIFFERENT cultures with different food and different languages and different music to those who don't know that. It would be like throwing Mexican and Spanish all together in one pot.  OR throwing Chinese and Japanese together in one pot. 

I think the two brothers who are NOW the owners are riding on the history of the ADDRESS of the building in the French Quarter and the tourists do not know the  the history of the actual food being served because there are so few Creoles or Cajuns who have a say in the matter.  

People don't know that they are eating something Gordon Ramsey (who has no historical reference for OUR Creole or Cajun food, because he's a Brit with a TV show) approximates as culturally ""about right"" food. BLAH! 

At least the place got cleaned up and maybe the food is edible but please don't ever call it Creole OR Cajun, it's neither."
EKEg8YXbGLQ4UWCx44nNaQ,,,So yummy and the staff was great! We had a large group but we got to sit at the top floor which was really spacious. There was a super long line for people without a reservation so I definitely recommend making one!

EKOpbcPQEP2Kwax8fKrJVg,"Lawd have mercy. The pimento mac and cheese is creamy and delicious. It could use a little bread crumb crunch, but it's so good as is it's hard not to like. Not a fan of the coleslaw. Too much celery seed flavor. Greens are greens, also not my favorite, but good if you normally like greens. The chicken portions are yuge. The hot is perfectly spicy.

We were recently married in New Orleans and were in need of a rehearsal dinner space, Oceana made it a hit. 
All of our guests LOVED the food, atmosphere and staff !!! Many of our party returned to Oceana throughout their stay due to the amazing service and delicious food. Our family planned the wedding from Austin, Tx and Kayleigh was a great help with all of our needs while organizing the dinner. She made this a breeze, they stayed within our budget needs and accommodated our party of 52 with no hiccups at all. Kim was our head waitress. Kim and her team brought a smile to everyones face. She had my grandfather rolling with laughter all night, my nephew was so taken with her he asked if we could all take a picture together. All of the food came out hot, in a timely manner, everyone was served all at once and when we had 2 very late arrivals within 10 minutes of our guests being there they had drinks and food as if they didnt miss a beat. We decided on a sit down meal that included a option of beverage, starter, entree and dessert. All of which were delightful.  We'd visited Oceana before for lunch and dinner and loved the food and very friendly service. This experience takes the cake though. The rehearsal dinner at Oceana was one of the best parts of the wedding week. ALL of the guests remarked how much fun they had, how adorable and true to the area the space was, how stupendous the staff was.  We will definitely be back and will use them for future events as well. 
THANK YOU Kayleigh, Kim and the staff from the D'Alfonso/Morris wedding - you made our evening and had our family in fits of laughter and great memories."
EKypdddvMmFaGamfzXKbEA,,"An absolute must is the chargrilled oysters or as I would like to call them -- crack oysters. The only setback was that they were shucked sloppily because all the oyster meat had pieces of hard shell in it. I also got the soft shell crab po boy which was good. Though there was a line couples were able to get in quickly and the service was fast too. Next time I will just order oysters, they are too good to pass up!","Came here after we saw a guy deliver oysters at our hotel in the elevator who was very enthusiastic about their oysters lol. Thanks to him I am very happy that this was the last place I ate before returning home. I tried multiple dishes and they were all delicious! The food came out quick which didn't really matter since we were enjoying the weather! My friend's and I were all satisfied with our meals and will come back if we are ever in NOLA again. I would highly recommend this place if you love seafood, oysters, and Cajun food!"

ELfP3v7fG_C1xiB0bEaJuA,"My fiancé has been raving about Hattie B's ever since he first tried it when he was in Nashville last year, so this was the first place we ate at when we got to Nashville. We got there around 11:30 on a cold, rainy Monday. The line was out the door but not very long-we only waited about 20 mins to place our order. The cashier was very friendly as were the other staff members we encountered. 

We both got the mild jumbo tenders. I got a side of mac and cheese and cole slaw and banana pudding. The chicken tenders were amazing. Very crispy and the chicken was tender. The mild was quite spicy for me, but I also am sensitive when it comes to spicy foods so I feel like most people would probably opt for the medium spice if they are looking for legit spicy chicken. I wish I would've gotten the fried chicken, but given that I'm not the biggest fried chicken fan I opted for the tenders instead. With that said, if I ever find myself back at Hattie B's I'd probably try the fried chicken. 

Now for the sides, I really didn't like them at all. It seems like a lot of people like their mac and cheese though, so this may be relative to my tastes as I don't like when the cheese in my mac and cheese is too soupy and creamy, and that's just what Hattie B's mac and cheese is. I only took a couple of bites and had my fiancé finish the rest. The cole slaw was just eh-it tasted like a generic cole slaw, nothing special. But-the banana pudding was SO FREAKING GOOD. Like I need again right now. I ate that pudding like a savage and was spooning the corners of the cup for more of it once I finished it. 

So, overall if it weren't for the sides I would've given Hattie B's 5 stars because their chicken and banana pudding is out of this world and I'd definitely recommend going when you're visiting Nashville!",,

We had catfish platter and shrimp platter, in addition to the crab cake which was amazing. Crab cake dish was one of the best I have ever had. It has big pieces of crab in it which made that dish stand out to me. Platters were okay, covered with thick layer of breading. Hush puppies are a little spicy because they are mixed with jalapeños I guess. 
The only issue with this place is that prices were a little higher than what I expected."

ENxhbmnMyytpXWu_TsaFdg,,"Now I understand the hype about Acme. Friends and family from home all suggested I make a stop to try their famous oysters while I was visiting The Big Easy. The first time we made a trip to the restaurant on a Sunday night, there was a very long line out the door and we were too hungry to wait. We tried again on a Monday and much to our surprise, there was no line and we were seated right away! We ordered the half dozen chargrilled oysters and a bowl of their jambalaya. The chargrilled oysters were excellent: large juicy pieces in their shells smothered in a tantalizing herb lemon sauce (topped with Parmesan cheese that we asked to take off) and served with fresh bread. This was the most memorable entree to me because we also ordered a plate of jambalaya (which I forgot to take a photo of). Service was also fantastic and I really felt the southern hospitality from our waitress.

If you're going to plan a trip to Acme then I suggest going on a weekday or around lunch time, otherwise you will be waiting in a very long line. Best oysters have had in the Big Easy so far!",

It's simple enough to understand. The food was not worth the hype. 

I'd rather go across the street to Felix where the line is short or non-existent and the oysters are large. Where I can order the same dish and get a larger version, cheaper.


And If this is not long enough, then please, go shove the other reviews up your ass., M.","After watching the Kitchen Nightmare episode here I was a bit worried. They made the owners seem like scum. 
But when I ate there, two times to make sure I was being fair, I was really happy to see that they were interesting... I won't call it amazing,I will call it ok. 
Maybe learn to balance salt with the food. You can't always rely on salt to make up for the not so amazing skills of your cooks. Hire a home cook. Most restaurants want experienced cooks but we all know (I hope) that most restaurants give people ONE JOB so while they have restaurant skills, it's very limited. A fry cook is not a viable option if you need other things...But a good home cook is great for multi-tasking. Wake upNOLA. We are F-ing ourselves up."

Nevertheless, it was a good experience and close to our air b&b place so no complaints.","Landed for the 1st time in Nola at midnight and came straight to this place based on YELP! we were seated at the corner table by the window. Ordered our first ever blackened and fried alligator tail bites, catfish po'boy, and the taste of New Orleans (jambalaya, etoufee, and Rea beans & rice). Our waitress was super sweet and suggested these to us, and it didn't disappoint! We loved the place and the food so much that we went back after an all-day/night drinking to grab the blackened alligator tail bites (so much better than fried y'all!!). Highly rec'd was his place!!"

I recommend going for lunch not dinner. It's much easier to sit down and enjoy. My personal favorite was the Boom Boom Shrimp and the Chargrilled Oysters. I typically do not like fried shrimp and it was very good. The fried batter was light on the shrimp and the bbq sauce on it was well balanced. I tried the Chargrilled Oysters, everywhere in the quarter and personally this was my favorite place. The staff was friendly, welcoming, and attentive from start to finish. I recommend trying this place if you happen to be visiting NOLA.",
EQN-PwGtCU9bPK68SCJhXA,,Excellent food and service. The line was long but it went fast. As soon as we entered you could smell the wonderful food. Every staff member greeted us which was a plus. I tried the chargrilled oysters and they were great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.,The food and service were both okay. I ordered the blackened catfish poboy. At first it looked burnt but it turned out to be very salty. The waiter was friendly and prompt. Overall it is a decent restaurant.
EQpI4XS0z-GB8idLweMhNA,"This fried chicken was delectable! We talked to some locals, and they said order to-go, so you don't have to wait forever! Best advice ever as the place is small, and the line was long. Even though, we brought it back to our hotel it was still fresh and warm. I got the chicken finger plate which is huge and should have gone mild, but was nervous because everyone raves how spicy they are!! I got potato salad and coleslaw, and both were great! They weren't over mayonnaisey but tasted fresh and complimented the chicken well. My husband got the fried chicken sandwich medium sauce which he loved and i tried it also, it was great! The comeback sauce was so good with the fries or dipped with the chicken! Little kick but not that spicy! The housemade lemonade was delicious too! All in all really impressed as ALL was good and made us happy to be eating Nashville's best!!  Coming back for sure! Maybe tomorrow",,
EQuVilDstW-R8Cax9lLrkg,,,Management and owners should be ashamed of how dirty this restaurant is.  The seats on the chairs are worn and dirty and the it smells like mildew. The floor was sticky.   Our food was not that great.. the fried shrimp came out cold and the gumbo was very watery. Stay way to many great restaurant in NOLA to have to deal with this. Service was not to bad.

The overall experience was fantastic, so next time you're in New Orleans PLEASE make this your first stop. You won't be disappointed.",

This one was topped with crawfish mushroom cream sauce and it was delicious! Garlic mashed potatoes were fine. This was my first time having sauteed mustard greens, and I must say they were very tasty. Our server, John, was excellent. This was a great way to finish off our trip to New Orleans."

ERh66eWeg5pQkA-vWpmx0Q,,"When we arrived on a Thursday evening around 7, the line was already forming down the street. We were skeptical but turns out this place is absolutely worth the wait! We started with a hurricane each and crawfish hush puppies. These guys were FILLED with crawfish. Just wish the order was larger! My sister, who isn't crazy about oysters, ordered a half dozen of the chargrilled oysters just because of the reviews she had heard about them. Turned out they were her favorite meal of our whole vacation. She loved these! She also had the soup of the day - corn and shrimp bisque. She said it was good but not great. My mom got the crab cake platter - lots of crab with little filler. My dad got a combo with grilled sausage, sausage gumbo, jambalaya and red beans and rice. He enjoyed everything but his favorite was the grilled sausage! For me, the seafood gumbo. It was delicious. Great flavor without being overly salty and had huge chunks of seafood. 

The only reason it's not 5 stars - the drink prices. My hurricane was more than my entree! It's not that the Hurricanes were necessarily expensive at $7 but that price is not in proportion with the food prices.","The restaurant is humongous inside so even if there is a line outside you won't have to wait long. Even if you do, it is worth the wait. The portions are HUGE and well priced. The waitstaff is always happy and willing to help or explain any menu items that you don't understand. You will leave full and happy every time. The cocktails are also a pretty good deal - reasonably priced and they don't skimp on the alcohol. I love the lemon drop and the hurricane. Tropical storm is also sweet and a different option!

As far as food, the fried fish platters are so big and fresh that you cannot go wrong. The seafood is notably fresh tasting and the breading is light and flavorful without overpowering the taste of the fish. I love the spicy jalapeño hush puppies that come with the entrees! We have tried the catfish, oyster, shrimp and combo plates.  My mother has ordered the seafood Alfredo and really enjoyed it. My favorite is the crab cake dinner. The crab cakes are huge and filled with fresh crab with little filler such as bread crumbs. The seasonings are spot on. As if they aren't flavorful enough on their own, the cakes are covered with a creamy shrimp and mushroom sauce which is out of this world. Even the greens that come with the dish are fantastic. I wish I could eat this dish all day. For appetizers, try the calamari or the bbq shrimp!"

ERuYxisNWc8cDKmuy3VkkA,,"It says good for kids with stroller icon, but when I asked if I could stand quietly in the corner with a sleeping baby strapped to my chest they said we had to wait outside. It was really hot and humid so I waited 40 mins and eventually the heat and noises kept her awake so we left. So if you have kids just don't bother. Great place for non-baby families, but it really wouldn't have hurt anyone if I waited in the empty corner with a sleeping baby.",
ES4YvjZFhV1NkvuxkFMvmw,"I am a die hard McDougal's fan, as it is in my neighborhood (and I love me some tossed in sauce!), but I love all my fried chicken and Hattie B's just does it so well. They use high quality, fresh meat and  it tastes like your momma made it. But better. (Sorry mom)(not sorry). 

If you feel like being healthy (traitor), and you want it grilled, they will definitely accommodate. Tons of traditional sides, too, so if you go with friends just try them all! I love the mac and cheese the most, so buttery and delicious.

Also, as this is Nashville hot chicken, it is HOT. Hot means hot, so don't try to show off and order the hottest one (Ryan), and then cry about not being able to eat it. Put on your big kid pants, choose wisely, and just enjoy!

But really, if all else fails - banana pudding mmmm....",,

After the appetizer i knew I could not eat another bite (although I wanted to). The servings are huge!!! My husband proceeded to eat blackened smothered red fish with greens. He enjoyed the meal but he was stuffed.

The food was phenomenal!   I had never tried a clam before eating here!  Wow!  It was pretty awesome!!!!!

It was alright, but I was definitely not blown away by it. I had the chargrilled oysters, seafood gumbo, and the crawfish poboy. Decent food, but I didnt get that burst of flavor that I've been hearing about. I'm sure there are more delicious options elsewhere.",
EV7Zj6Jyf2tcuFB2Fv1shg,,"We only ate a half dozen of the regular oysters and 24 of the charbroiled when we were there.  The plain oysters were good, fresh, and flavorful, but had some grit in them.  I am sure that with how quick this place cranks through the little guys, they do not allow enough time to purge out the sediment.  The charbroiled were great but really how hard is it to make something delicious when you pour cheese and garlic on it?  All in all I would give the food between a 3 and 4, but our waitress was awesome so they get a solid 4.  Moving like a Tasmanian devil she would fill my water constantly.  When we got another beer and in 2 seconds decided to go a little lighter, I literally had to run to chase her down and she had started to pour what we had ordered before.  In a place this busy and later in the night when we went it is difficult to have that much energy and that kind of service stands out.",
EVFv1Rc3sG59b8GCtH-P_A,"Hot chicken? What in the heck is that I said before I tried it. Hot Chicken refers to the seasoning. It is truly amazing. The side dishes were nice portions and the banana pudding was enough to take me over the edge. When i am back in Tennessee, I will definitely attempt to get back to this place and eat. I read about it on the internet and we went. I did not know that their would be a line to get in as the food is to die for. I stood outside in sub-30 degree weather in a line with many to taste the goodness. I must say I would do it again.",,

EVYxQ4T_a8Z28GYkWx0FZw,"My husband and I came to Nashville the second week of October because we came for our honeymoon, and EVERYONE told us to try Hattie B's at least once. NOW I KNOW WHY!

We got the chicken delivered to us, and I got medium chicken tenders and my husband ordered the mild chicken tenders. THEY WERE SO JUICY and the meat is not greasy at all; instead, the breading is crispy and perfectly cooked! Also, the medium sauced ones were so spicy, I can't imagine what the hot ones taste like! I LOVE spicy food, but we also ate this late at night, so it ended up upsetting my stomach, but it was worth it haha. The chicken meals come with 2 sides and so I got french fries which were delicious and flavorful steamed spinach. Honestly, I want to come back to Nashville just to come back here and eat some chicken. My husband was also impressed by his food and we still talk about how good it was and that we want to come back here.

Overall, I will definitely come back here again, and seriously though, I would never assume this was fast food if you put this on a plate and served it to me. The quality is top-notch and the prices aren't bad at all, especially for the high quality.",,

Raw oysters-super fresh and huge. 

Chargrilled oysters-first bite I was so in love. That cheese melted all over it, but now I know it was super oily and so greasy. 

Boo fries-cheese and gravy. This was really good, but got a bit salty

Fried crawfish-I love that I didn't have to peel anything and the sauce that comes with it is so yummy.",

The line took probably 10 minutes and it was five of us on a sunday afternoon lunch. 

I'm not giving the last star because everything was good, but besides the chargrilled (maybe charboiled now that i think about it), everything else was good...meh. 
Very packed and okay service.","10% off with check in is a great start! 
We sat on the second floor which had a terrace we could walk out with.

I ordered the oyster/shrimp po'boy with a side of red beans & rice and my gf got the catfish/shrimp platter with hush puppies. both dishes were really good.

Although smaller than my po'boy from Johnnys Po'Boy, this one was a lot tastier (not to take anything away from Johnnys). The red beans were HELLA good, probably the best I ever had. 

My gf enjoyed her plate too. Her hush puppies were very light ad flavorful. The catfish had a nice crust and was very good.",

I had the half shrimp Po boy which was pretty good, but the seafood gumbo just ok. Come here for the NOLA feel, the efficient staff and the neon signs. Watch the flames from the grill as you enjoy your ice cold local beer and grilled oysters.",

The food is crazy unhealthy but as a treat you should do it. Do it more than once a month you risk cardiac arrest. It's greasy but is really good. Best fried chicken I ever had.

The dish came with hash browns and a delicious honey biscuit. My friend ordered the hash and loved it ! The French toast was not good at all.

Let me start off by saying that my husband and I aren't the biggest seafood lovers. But when in Rome, right? We opted for the crab cakes as a starter. This was only the second time I had ever tried these and was amazed! The cakes were crisp, crab was mild, and the amount of spice was just right (I do recommend having a bottle of TUMS on hand). My husband ordered the red beans and rice for his entree and I the fried catfish. The servings were huge and the food was delicious. And to top everything off, our service was impeccable. 

This was our first time in New Orleans and have since booked another trip for this coming summer. Oceana will definitely be accommodating us for another southern meal!"

I will not lie to you, I have never had oysters and the aroma was calling my name. I did something daring and opted to try it and liked it. Didn't OD though.....1 was enough LOL. If it wasn't fried, Lyn D would not have went there. Prefer my food cooked!

E_6Canw4EI36AvgOkxxrLw,,"Group of 13 on a Wednesday night. Y'all. This is NOT the place for groups. Or if you want even remotely quick service. They would only split our bill 3 ways AND would only take a maximum of 3 credit cards for the order. What kind of BS is that?!! 

The server brought out our bill and had us write beside what we ordered which check it should be put on. So imagine 13 people taking their turn marking down what they ate on the bill. THEN brought back the 3 bills and we had to figure out who owed what on THAT bill. Thankfully we had cash!! 

I ordered the shrimp platter. Asked the server if I could get onion rings. Would've gladly paid an up-charge. He said no. I thought he was being sarcastic, but he wasn't. He literally said he's not allowed to make that substitution. WTH seriously?? What kind of restaurant doesn't allow substitutions?? 

My shrimp platter was average. Reminded me of Popeyes fast food shrimp. The Boo fries were surprisingly good. I was drinking Hurricanes. They were $9 each. Not worth it. I'm not a heavy drinker. I had three hurricanes and barely had a buzz. 

The server was very slow and didn't seem to care if we were happy with anything. 

Best part?? An 18% tip was automatically added to the bill. Ordinarily I would have no problem with the tip being included, but our server was more along the lines of 10% gratuity.

We came here on a Friday night during the youth Lutheran convention (30,000 pre-teens) We waited about 20 minutes to get a seat. This place is loud!! the beer selection is pretty awesome and the menu is diverse and unique to someone from the North.

We ordered grilled oyster, salty & rich; raw oysters, fresh and clean; shrimp po boy, salty, crunchy and HUGE! and fried crawfish tails, crispy but not much fishy flavor.

We ordered too much food, but everything was pretty great. It was crowded and loud and people kept knocking into our seats, but it's to be expected in a place like this.

Definitely worth it for anyone not sure of where to try real oyster/southern treats.
Also very good for large groups, they seemed to accommodate all size groups.",

E_liLDoiGAWdEByYrnKCIw,,,"Food: 
The food was tasty and well spiced. My husband ordered the Fried Shrimp Po-Boy ($14.00). The bun was soft and lightly toasted, the shrimp and sauces were very flavorful. The side of fries was generous. 

I ordered the Crawfish Etouffee and our water suggested I should add crab ($15.00+$5). The sauce was slightly spicy, I added a bit more hot sauce to spice it up. It was very tasty and had great flavors

Drinks:
Hurricaine - $9. Sweet, but not too sweet! Perfect

Our waiter, Guy was extremely attentive and very helpful. He was a great waiter. The only issue is that we had just arrived from CA and were starved. Our food didn't arrive until almost an hour after we ordered. This was by far one of the longest waits we've ever had for food. 

We will definitely be back!"

E_uNo6kwDSqwFMd5hArzhA,"Even though it's been a while, I still think of Hattie B's! That's the first meal I had after checking into my hotel in Nashville. Their hot chicken isn't outrageously hot! I can even tolerate their hottest level! The pimento Mx and cheese is delicious! I've never had pimento Mac, and I miss it just thinking of it. Damn delicious!",,
E_zGMv8c7f2q6WQXzIXr7Q,"Solid hot chicken overall. Excellent crisp that is maintained very well even after being drenched in a good coat of their spicy oil. I also like that the batter is not overly thick, but well balanced. Comparatively, I have to say the flavor is inferior to Prince's, but still very good. 

I have to  take down a star because the sides were honestly just not that great. I've been able to sample them all, and they did not rock my chicken world. But hey if you just focus on the chicken I think all is well. But geez the supporting cast is just weak you know-- watery mac and cheese without richness, and really everything else seems like those pre-made sides from Walmart that that one guy will bring to the potluck at the last minute.",,

EaFeJOQZvg0aXq1ZB8n0aQ,,,Service was pretty good which is the only reason i gave a generous 3 stars but y'all have some work to do on the food. I had the seafood gumbo and the fried crawfish tails. The gumbo was served lukewarm and not the ideal temperature for soup. Soup should be served piping hot at all times so that was disappointing. Now for the flavor you all are lacking seasoning tremendously. The hot sauce saved the day but real gumbo doesn't need anything added to it so that was a thumbs down for me. The fried crawfish tails were fried to perfection but it also was very bland lacking any seasoning. For this to be New Orleans cuisine i need you all to step it up for the culture. I would recommend you all start using some slap ya mama cajun seasoning
EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA,"What to get: large dark meal
Service: 5/5
Atmosphere: casual, take out
Wait: 10 mins (Tuesday 5:30PM for 1)
Parking: good luck

The Experience:
Biggest tip I can give you: order online ahead of time. Not only do you not have to wait in line, but your order is ready when you want it to be. You can even pre-order up to 2 weeks in advance!

I've been dying to try Hattie B's for a long time. Finally got my chance when I did a solo road trip down south. I knew I was going to get there during early dinner time, so I ordered my meal online ahead of time. Note: they are in the central time zone.

Parking...oh man, I don't know what to tell you. You can be a delinquent like me and park in the 15 mins parking for the cupcake shop (and get glared at), or you can circle around to find a nearby lot or street parking. Since I got my food to-go, I thought it would be better to eat in the car partially to guard my car, but also not to be that person who gets their food and sits at a table when everyone else has waited in line.

Supposedly you can just walk up to the counter and grab your order if you did it online. You already paid for it, so there's little for you to do once you get to the front of the line. A cold, winter Tuesday, there were about 8 people in line in front of me. That's all that could fit inside the doors, but luckily there wasn't a crowd of people behind me. I didn't need to wait in line, but it took me no more than 10 mins to get to the register. They order by groups, so you can go nab a table if you need it. There's 2 areas for sitting: inside and then inside a covered patio(?). I don't think more than 40 people can dine at a time, but I could be wrong since I didn't look closely into the covered area.

I ordered the large dark meal, which is 2 legs (thigh + drumstick). After reading previous reviews, I went for medium spiciness. Turns out it's more for flavor, since my nose wasn't running while I was eating. I think for an actual 'kick' you need to do hot or more. The meal comes with 2 sides, which I can't comment on since I haven't tried them yet. I only ate the hot chicken and it must have looked like I was a starved animal by how quickly I devoured both pieces. The breading has wonderful flavoring and thick enough crispy layer, I didn't leave a single piece left over. 

Now that I've gotten to taste Hattie B's, I, for sure, will be ordering more when passing through. I think this is how fried chicken should taste like, so this is my new standard. Maybe next time I can actually go for 'hot' hot chicken. *fingers crossed*",,
EabLlaJ7BH-RNgJ0xKfExQ,,"On line I was expecting this nice restaurant- and Inside was pretty dingy. It's a tourist TRAP. The oysters were good. Other then that don't bother.

EaeekNRTHToAAVmp-PymtQ,"Wow great food. This place was recommended to me by multiple people, and very worth it. I would give this 5 stars, however the hour wait is not fun (in the hot summer heat) which kills it. Get the Pimento Mac n' cheese as a side, worth the extra calories I promise.",,
Ean_HFx2IT7AAMtKmWyQjw,,Most likely you will wait about 5-10 minutes outside. No big deal except for the dumpster smell all around. Ordered the red beans and rice...excellent not too salty as other places do. Chargrilled oysters as appetizer was a different treat never experienced before. Cheesy oysters kinda thing good on the french bread. The highlight of the night by far was the oyster poboy. Knocked my socks and block off. A+ to that sammy. Would give place 5 stars but it's fairly high priced and the outside street smell while waiting is pretty noxious and restaurant gets very LOUD. Will return if I ever go back to N.O.,

The staff/cashier was helpful, friendly and extremely peppy!  The place is small so there is limited seating.  Now for the food...oh my word I was in heaven!  The mac&pimento was to die for, just the right amount of cheese and texture was perfect.  The chicken was fried to perfection, and the chicken was juicy!!  I got the medium heat but should have stepped in up to hot.  Hands down the best fried chicken I have ever tasted!",,
EbCkm8ZD7m-igZ7iWDWk0w,,,"Awesome place to have a delicious causal meal.  The eggplant sticks were so good! It's like french fries, but with eggplant, who knew!

She was so friendly, it was such a treat for a New Yorker lol!  Try this place out!"
EbHKtycVzjc02cp51KZ6qw,,,"Delicious!! We started with the alligator sausage, which had a fantastic flavor. Unfortunately, the temperature felt as though the sausage had been sitting our. It was very lukewarm. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo obviously because I'd read all the reviews from you great Yelpers. And let me say, it was definitely one of the best I've ever had. The chicken was blackened perfectly and the suave was unctuous. Of course I had to try the dessert. The Bourbon pecan pie with ice cream was outstanding. Flaky, caramel-y  and merged with creamy vanilla ice cream..again, fantastic. Oh, I also had a hurricane, which I think could have been bigger for the price."

My favorite dish was definitely the chargrilled oysters. At dinner time we had to wait for a table so be in mind of that. Service is quick, which is good. One of my favorite restaurants from my trip to New Orleans.",
Ebt0jWGL1vDnwxNnNx6uOw,,"Locals and tourists alike highly recommended this place so we decided to check it out. We ordered the chargrilled oysters and their fried ""peace maker"" po'boy. It was our first time trying oysters and man, were they delicious!! They are chargrilled with some butter and cheese sprinkled on top and served with slices of French bread and lemons. The best way to eat them was with a lil' squirt of lemon juice and a lil' dab of hot sauce. Scoop the remnants with the French bread.  The po'boy was disappointing. Primarily because it's not a very big sandwich and pretty bland to be honest. Not sure how Adam Richman decided this was a top sandwich in America. Either way, they had a great looking menu and almost everyone raves about it. Will definitely go back for their chargrilled oysters.",

They called us up soon after as everyone in front of us was a party of two.  Had to dump our beers on the way in.  Crab claws and oysters were the apps., followed by some po boys and boo fries. I'd say the boo fries (gravy and cheese smothered fries) were my favorite.  It was very good food but nothing made me stop in my tracks with its utter delicious ness.  I would go back if I were in Nola again.",
EdHdVPXJWv8Z1PQ5xVn60A,,"So you have to try this place in my opinion.  The oysters are top shelf and its a traditional spot.  Its been around forever.  They are also handling covid well.  They have a line that forms outside and they are not seating much of the restaurant to stay safe.

The food is solid and the oyster po boy and raw oysters are on point.  I also like the voodoo bloody mary which has merlot in it and is very unique.  I would hit this place up once a week if it was near my house.",

EdrZZEfl6CHkgw-BjDcHsA,,"This was our first restaurant in New Orleans. We got in late on a Wednesday night so we found this place as I was craving oysters and they were open till midnight!

It was a packed house and I am glad we didn't have to wait for a table for long. Our host and server were friendly. The place was pretty dark so it was hard to take good pictures. Our server was cool and attended to us efficiently. We ordered hurricanes as this was their special drinks. It was pretty strong and they serve it in plastic cups. I guess its for to-go?

We all ordered different things to try everything. We did get a dozen oysters on a half shell and charbroiled oysters. The chilled oysters are a little bigger and darker than the ones I get in Cali. This was still good and did not have that sea taste. Its served with cocktail sauce and horseradish. The horseradish was not spicy at all. The charbroiled oysters were good but can be a little salty due to the cheese and butter. The oysters hella shrunk! Its good served with french bread to soak up the butter and cheese. This is what we ordered as meals:

1/2 Shrimp Po Boy sandwich - was good and had a lot of breaded shrimp. This was big for a half sandwich. It was kinda big and messy to eat but also felt like there was more bread to the shrimp. 

Side cup seafood gumbo - was good. No kick in it.

Boo Fries - is similar to Poutine Fries; gravy and shredded beef on fries but it was good.

Seafood Ettoufee - was good and had a few pieces but not all that special to me.

New Orleans Medley - was ok. It was a sampling of gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and grilled smoked sausage. The jambalaya was dry, the smoked sausage was not spicy.

I give this more a 3.7 stars. Customer service was good, tables were sticky, food and drinks were pretty good but I was wondering ...I thought cajun food was spicy?  ;-p",
Ee1zSUQAQ6-3gLDtSWdS_g,,"After looking at the hours online we went to the restaurant at 7:00 pm on New Years Day. The line was shorter than expected which should have been the first red flag. 

When we were up next to be seated the host came out to tell us they were no longer serving raw or chargrilled oysters. As we stood there scratching our heads we saw several people inside eating raw and chargrilled oysters. 

We were seated and sure enough, they told us they weren't serving them. We ordered our food and it came out pretty quick. 

While we were waiting for our food, the guy working the oyster bar told us the manager decided to stop selling oysters so the employees could get out of there quicker since it's been a long day for them. They were also closing 2 hours earlier than their sign, Google, and their website said. 

This was such a disappointing visit. We understand it was a holiday, but it's unacceptable to stop selling your namesake just to get your employees out earlier. There are way too many other restaurants to choose from to be treated like this.",
EeNC44B780U-JGn5Kd_iuw,,"Came here for lunch and was seated pretty quickly for a group of three in the middle of a weekend (it was relatively early for lunch). The fried oysters for appetizers were very good but I would recommend ordering more than one if you are in a small group. I ordered SEAFOOD ÉTOUFFÉE which was the first time I ever tried this dish. It was sooooo good! Buttery, savory - I could have licked my plate clean. Good amount of seafood within the dish and the creamy roux that was drizzled over the rice and seafood was divine! I still crave about it months later.",
Ef-NDzuYpy9Y_ntbk6GUfQ,,"I am only giving this place 3 stars because of two major complaints.  One, upon arriving the person working the door was a dick.  2.  My first time in NOLA and I had my heard set on doing the 15 dozen oyster challenge and I first approved, and then denied.  I had a light buzz going on and put ordered a dozen oysters.  Although very tasty, they were quite tiny and I was thinking I could definately conquer this challenge and I wanted my name on the wall.  I told my waiter that I wanted to attempt the 15 dozen oyster challenge, even after having a dozen in me.  They brought me up to the section of the bar where you are right in front of the shuckers and they can watch everything you do.  The gm came over to me and said there were some papers that I had to fill out, and she had to go and get them.  I'm anxious with anticipation at this point!!  Upon her arrival she apologized and said that she was not going to allow me to do the challenge.  She told me that ever since the BP oil spill they do the challenge sparingly because it all depends on the daily shipments and they have to cover the entire restaurant.  With a bit of dissappointment, I understood there point.  It's not there fault BP are a bunch of a**holes, lol.  I think if I was able to do the challenge I would've given Acme between 4 and 5 stars, but the door man, who was a ass, and a shipment problem that is obviously not their fault and not to blame I will give 3 stars.  I will head back to NOLA in June and hopefully by then I can re-attempt this challenge!!",

The heat is toned-down (the medium barely registers, the hot is not painful), but as fried chicken goes, it's good, and it's consistent. The sides are good.

We were there for a party so our group had plently to chat while waiting. 
Note: They will not sit you unless your entire party is present, so if you waited 1 hour and all are not there you lose your spot!

2 stars for the hostess/host
ambiance - non existent but who cares? I am here for the FOOD.
Wait time - 25 mins for a party of 4, no calling ahead

It was our last night in Nola and we were looking for somewhere yummy to eat, nothing too fancy, but we wanted a good mix of food to try for our last night.

Starters - Grilled oysters - This was my favorite thing on the menu. The butter herbed sauce, melted Parmesan cooked over an open fire. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. There was extra butter sauce on the plate after we scarfed down the oysters and 2 pcs of bread that come with the platter, so we asked for another loaf and drenched up the rest of the buttery goodness.

Craw puppies -  not sure what this really was, but it was fried bread thing dipped in some white sauce.

Crab cakes - Real chunks of crab and yummy sauce to dip it in. Not sure if the crab was fresh, but did I say Big Chunks?

Po Boy - half with catfish, half with oysters. I am not a fan of fried food, but I had one bite of the hunnie's sandwich. While it didn't seem too heavy because of the lettuce balancing it out, it just wasn't up my alley. The hubs enjoyed it though.

Shrimp Etoufee - It was kind of odd, everywhere we went in Nola, they could not make my food spicier for me., this Shrimp Etoufee included. Wet shrimpy saucy gravy over rice. I've never had this before, so I don't know what to compare it to, but it would have been bland had I not doused it in Tabasco Chipotle. Rice, gravy easy to eat with a spoon, I was satisfied with this dish. Luckily I ordered the Large size.

Gumbo - The folks said this tasted about average. Looks like this is right on point compared to the other yelper's experiences here

Jambalaya - The folks said this was about average too.

Note- Try to show up with the entire party before hopping into line. It was kind of interesting , ok fine, it was annoying when the hostess asks you if your party of 4 is here and you have a few people wandering off(the curious boyfriend), and first she groups your with someones elderly grandmother, and then another group of people behind you, who are looking at you like you have lost your mind (There are no asians in NOLA) even after you point out your boyfriend is right over there 5 feet away several times as soon as the hostess/host team approach you. I wonder why 2 people are needed for this job.

I would come back though, These grilled oysters are so delish!",

There were maybe 20 people in front of our party of 5. It took maybe 40 minutes to get in, order, grab a table and get our food! It was totally worth it! The fried chicken was delicious, tender, spicy....we opted for the hot variety. The pimento mac & cheese was creamy. Potato salad was good too! Splurged on the banana pudding for dessert! We loved our meal, and will return on another visit to Nashville.",,
Ejx_fuNEyifoIi37I0_6uQ,"When I say this hot chicken was amazinggggg!!!!! Omggggg!!!!! I love spice so I tried the hot which was perfect. My nose ran a little so that's good lol. I tried the bacon and cheese grits and they taste like heaven. The Mac and cheese and greens were great as well. I had to put hot sauce on the greens though. There was a small line outside, but it moved fast. If the line was down the street, I'd still wait. You must go here when visiting Nashville.",,

Our first meal after we landed we tried the gator bites half blackened half fried, first time trying gator and we are hooked so pleasantly surprised on how tender the meat is. My fiancé has the Cajun pasta and loved every bite of the shrimp. I had the taste of New Orleans we kept swapping bites and loved every minute of it. So tempted to come back for every meal on our trip to explore the rest of the menu"

The line to get in moves fast.",
Ek_PUms1Xx3sY1osnCvXYg,,,"Be sure to make a reservation!! We made one and when got there, this place had a huge line and we walked right in with no wait because of our reservation. 

So how was the food you ask...


1. Taste of New Orleans dish was amazing. My husband enjoyed it. I tried a couple bites and it steaming hot and tasted delicious!

2.Shrimp Po Boy however was NOT good. The shrimp was so cold and the coleslaw made it taste funny. 

It could possibly be that we went to Gene's Po Boy the night prior and has the absoulutely best po boy ever there so my review on Oceana po boy might be a bit bias.(Go to Gene's for po boys!)

Overall, probably will skip this place in the futuee."
EkcDDH12lkNANzyPBn4Vzg,"Writing this 1 month later because I am literally having cravings for some Hattie b's hot chicken!  This was one of my favorite meals I had during my last trip to Nashville. Really don't know how I hadn't been here before considering I love me some fried chicken! 

I got the small order which was a white breast and thigh and a side of Mac and cheese and black eye pea salad. Additional condiments consisted of ranch and side of xtra hot sauce for dipping. Oh and can't forget my ice tea lemonade drink (Love Arnold palmers).  Everything was very reasonably priced. 

The black eye pea salad was tangy and delightful, Mac and cheese creamy and great with an added hit of hot sauce. The chicken was the perfect amount of heat, it made my nose run but I couldn't stop eating. 

Seriously Hattie B's would you consider coming to NYC? I'd be your first customer!!",,
EkiiunF9lWEcLqjZTaSMQg,,,"First off, there is road construction just outside the front door. The food was good. We wanted char grilled oysters but they were out. Bummer."
Ekw7wuUTX36BtcPP6XnA-Q,,"I spend a lot of time in New Orleans and have been here many times with friends.  In my opinion, the food here is overrated.  I usually get the étouffée and have noticed a negative change in the dish over the last few years.   The chargrilled oysters are good, but honestly there is nothing special about them here. My buddies seem to enjoy the food so they come back. Just here for the company. 

We always get good service but they are definitely turning the tables as quickly as possible (which I understand). 

Personally, I think that they have made a good name for themselves and is a place that tourists go.  There are a ton of options in the quarter (if you must eat there), go out and explore.","I have passed Oceana a number of times during my trips.   Finally decided to try it and had mixed reviews.   

Really liked the decor.  You wouldn't believe how much room that this place has.   Our waitress was attentive and the service was good.   

The food was where the experience was mixed.  We started off with the chargrilled oysters. I was really disappointed in them as the were not fully cooked and not as good as others I have had in other locations.  The bright spot of the meal was the crawfish etoufee.  Portions were good and it had good flavor to it.  It also had a nice slow burn that built throughout.  Just the way I like it  

Overall it was a good experience minus the chargrilled oysters.  For me, I eat a lot of chargrilled oysters when I am in NOLA. For that reason, I might pass."

Hattie B's is actually a great place to sit down and hang and eat great food and GREAT service. What a novel idea...We have already returned once and I cannot wait to get back over! My only reason to not give 5 Stars is the parking is  terrible, horrible, ghastly and exhausting. I circled the block so many times I felt like a NASCAR driver.

Emn-3MS2rfRJc7MmT4AAcw,,,"Of all the meals I've had here in the French Quarter, this is arguable one of the most disappointing Cajun/Creole food. I am not sure why there was a long line on Saturday night, and why it had such great reviews on Yelp. 

We got seated outside in the patio, and our waiter provided pretty good service. He gave us several recommendations, and we ended up ordering the Cajun Jambalaya Seafood Pasta and Taste of New Orleans, both of which he recommended. 

The Cajun Jambalaya was alright, nothing really to complain about. But the Taste of New Orleans was a big disappointment. It had crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice, and Creole Jambalaya. The red beans and rice, were literally red beans and rice. It was so dry it tasted something I could've gotten at Chipotle... I was so glad I didn't just order red beans and rice and felt really bad for the table next to us, who got two orders of just red beans and rice.. they probably didn't know that's what they were getting themselves into. The crawfish in the crawfish etouffee were mushy, telling me that the crawfish was not fresh.. 

I seriously don't understand why this place got so many reviews and such a high rating. I don't think we ordered the wrong thing either since our waiter said their Cajun Jambalaya Seafood Pasta probably has the best reviews... 

Probably another tourist trap. If you want good cajun/creole food, go to other places in the FQ."
EmrahJMelcioolXzG8TVng,"Probably the most popular chicken spot in TN. I was just hoping the substance matched the hype. And indeed it did. Take-out/delivery only of course because Nashville hasn't yet opened up sit-down eating. We ordered a small two piece dark (which is one leg quarter) and the chicken tenders. We didn't select hot (I know, what's the point in avoiding hot at Hattie B's but it is what it is).  The chicken was seasoned and battered well and tasted good. The Mac and cheese",,
EnAAcay6ButaNC41ShnDrw,,,"Red Beans and Rice.  Crawfish Etouffe.  Both mind-blowing.  The Crawfish Etouffe was the best of what we had, but the red beans and did the best against expectations.  The gator sampler (half blackened half fried) was also delicious.  If someone asked for a random place in the main downtown of NOLA to try ""classic"" NOLA food, this is where I'd direct them."
EnBamd1rcz0IAZxVUz5N3w,,"I had very high expectations for this place. I was expecting some bomb ass oysters. I ordered a half dozen raw and a half dozen charbroiled oysters. Both had one similarity, they had me spitting out huge pieces of debris or chewing on grit. I honestly think you could pass on the raw and would recommend you go to Lüke for their oysters instead. Hello, for Happy Hour Lüke serves $0.75 raw oysters and they are way better. Charbroiled Oysters at ACME offered a better flavor profile. The delicious herb-butter sauce was heaven. Make sure you dribble some of the sauce on these lightly cheesy oysters before eating. I couldn't stop drenching bread into the buttery pool of all things wonderful and shoving it in my mouth. Ambrosia!

If you do come here and when, that's right I said when, I come back, I'd get their fried dishes. I also ordered one of their fried seafood platter, fish and shrimp. The tilapia was flakey and soft and perfectly lightly breaded and crispy. The same went for their fried shrimp but you need to ask them for lots of tartar sauce. They have the best tartar sauce! The fries were normal fries. I opted for their cole slaw side which was also yummy. Not overly tart.",

But the side of fried crawfish tails were good. Lightly battered and fried is always good!! I had their seafood gumbo poopa!! Poopa! I know, sounds funny, but it's basically a bread bowl. It was good, but it was carb overload with the rice in the gumbo. I'd definitely go back and try more oysters.",
Ep4gK9Vs0IxRAwsCKLXqQQ,,"THE GRILLED OYSTERS.

Came here seeking out the dozen chargrilled oysters and had high expectations before walking in, but that didn't stop Acme from blowing my mind with the tender and cheesy goodness of the dish.

Before I continue I feel obligated to mention that there will be a very lengthy line here if you decide to come on a weekend or holiday. I happened to be in town for Memorial Day weekend so the line extended halfway down the block. Instead of waiting, I came back the next morning fifteen minutes before opening time and the line was significantly shorter. 

Besides the oysters, I also had the Boom Boom Shrimp, which was glazed in a spicy mayo-like sauce and was very crispy and delicious. However, it wasn't something unique or interesting. I also had a sampler which included red beans and rice, seafood gumbo, and gator sausage. Again, all three components were good but no individual item stood out. The best red beans I had while in NOLA was at Willie Mae's, gator sausages / hotdogs are excellent and comparatively cheap at Dat Dog, and gumbo you can get anywhere and it'll taste pretty similar (at least in my experience). 

So long story short... the chargrilled oysters hype is real",

Very informative on the menu items, including promoting the breakfast menu even though we told him we were leaving in the morning. Haha. Great salesman. Very friendly & conversational in general. The food took a little long to come out- really no big deal. Both Ron and the person who brought out the food apologized for the delay which was unnecessary but implied they are usually prompt with serving. 

Hubby got the cajun fries with a side of fried cajun tails and I got the cajun vegetarian stew. Both dishes were the bomb!! He couldn't finish his dish because it was huge, but per him, it was amazing. It looked loaded with the gravy & already came with crawfish tails in the gravy. He loved it. I know this because he didn't even touch the side of ranch, and my man is a ranch man. I didn't know they had the stew so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it as a choice and when I ate my first bite. So much flavor!- a great balance of savory & some tang. And the bread was nice and soft."

I went in and was third in line. Still had to wait about 15 mins before I could order...which was fine. It gave me time to look at the menu. I order the wings & 2 sides to go.

We arrived to a long line stretching outside the front doors - a good sign! :)  When we reached the counter, we decided to order the ""medium"" spiced chicken, so that we can appreciate the flavor without burning our mouths off.  I ordered the large dark meat plate with a side of fries and mac & cheese.  The chicken was very good and the ""medium"" spice was a bit more than medium (glad I didn't get the hot!).  The fries were fine but the mac & cheese wasn't anything special.  The service was excellent and the ambiance gave us an appreciation for Southern cuisine.  I would try different sides next time I'm in town!",,

During my recent visit, it was approximately 9:30pm and it appeared as though most places that served food in the area where either closed or was no longer serving food. 

Upon walking in my first thought was ""tourist trap"". Do I still think it's a bit of a tourist trap... yes, but they do have some redeeming qualities. Our waiter was so incredibly sweet. I truly can't praise him enough. He truly knew the menu and how to make our experience at Oceana Grill the best it could possibly be. For my meal I ordered the Taste of New Orleans, which included Creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice with smoked sausage. Was it the best meal I've ever had? No. Was I full when I left? Yes. I really enjoyed the red beans and rice. However, the smoked sausage was the strangest tasting sausage I've ever eaten. I took 3 bites and couldn't eat anymore of it. The jambalaya was ok... not my favorite, but simply ok. My friends each ordered fried samplers and raved about it. I'll take their word for it though. 

The decor, I felt was a bit obnoxious, and for me screamed TOURISTS! I felt genuinely bad for the staff having to wear the shirt and ties with the big ole Oceana Grill patch on them. Couldn't pay me to wear one of those. 

Overall, my experience here was just ok. Was I satisfied when I left? Yes. Am I likely to return? Probably not."

ErWPjeuK5uKHLmtz4BM9ng,"If I had to describe Hattie B's in one word, it would be: OVERRATED.

Maybe it's the fact that this place is ""world famous"", or that it was featured on the Food Network - but it just did NOT live up to the hype. And to wait hours! They don't even take your name down and call you back (as most busy restaurants do nowadays) so you have no choice but to stand in line.

Once my friends and I FINALLY made it inside (after over an hour of waiting), we were, for the most part, let down by our food. I got the large dark with sides of mac and cheese and crinkle cut fries. The chicken was good, it definitely wasn't bad by any means - but I've had better fried chicken at several other places. The sides were below average - my mac and cheese came out lukewarm, and even if it had been served hot, it still needed texture to it. I ate a few fries and didn't even want to finish them (they were that bland).

Would I come back here? Maybe...if there wasn't a wait. It's definitely a tourist trap, I'll tell ya that.",,

EtFYEN0sbxkZOOt3DE7vWg,"Some reviews are saying Hattie's was expensive. I thought it was SO CHEAP for the amount of food we got. The portions are huge! We went to Hatties on a Tuesday around 11:30. There was a line of about 30-40 people outside, but decided to wait. We really only waited about 15 minutes. You order as soon as you walk in and are given a number. The seating area is small with only about 10 tables inside and 8-10 tables on the patio.

The menu is very simple. Chicken + sides. I guess that's what you get when you go to a place that masters their chicken. There are also 5 heat levels. We went with the Mild chicken with a side of hot sauce. We split the Large White ($11.50 2 breast/2 wings/2 sides) with homemade coleslaw and pimento mac n cheese. This is DEF enough food for two people- plus we added two chicken tenders ($1.50 each) because why not! Let them know you are splitting the meal and they will split it for you on separate plates.

The chicken was awesome. Super moist, but crispy on the outside. The Mild breading was hot enough for my husband, but I dipped mine in the hot sauce too. It was enough kick to not make me hate myself. The coleslaw was refreshing to have in-between eating the chicken- very good and not runny or too much mayo. The pimento mac n cheese was bomb though! Very good! The chicken tenders were really good and had great flavor.

ps. They offer a brunch menu on Sunday where you can get hot chicken and waffles!!",,

I will say, the chicken is pretty ""greasy.""  Like soaked in it.  I wasn't a fan of such gallons of grease dripping from from my chicken.  That was major drawback. 

Having said that, the chicken and sides were yummy - but I didn't finish chicken, again, too greasy for my tummy.  It was expensive.  $10 bucks for simple chicken meal.  With drink and tax, you're at $14 bucks.",,

We were seated fairly quickly after a brief wait outside. Our server greeted us right away and delivered much needed water to the table. We started with an order of oyster shooters - vodka, cocktail sauce, and a fresh raw shucked oyster. I was hesitant but my husband talked me into it, and I'm glad he did. The cocktail sauce and vodka was like a Bloody Mary and the oyster added good flavor. 

We shared a half dozen chargrilled oysters after that. They were served bubbling hot with a side of fresh bread. I believe pretty much anything can be improved by garlic, cheese, and butter; these were not an exception to my life rule. 

I had the surf n' turf po'boy, which my friend had specifically called out as her favorite. It featured golden fried gulf shrimp and roast beef with a honey horseradish sauce. I was intrigued by the flavor combinations, not sure how it would all come together. It was magical - the fried shrimp added just the right amount of salt and crunch to the sweet and spicy roast beef. 

The staff were efficient and helpful. We never waited long to have plates cleared or water refilled. 

There's a reason the place is as popular as it is and often has a wait. Excellent food in a fun environment.",

This was a great resturant to intrude a first timer to New Orleans . The food was outstanding , the gator bites were great . We ordered hurricanes, please order these with the collector glass it's well with it . Overall an outstanding eating experience .
Thanks.Oceano I will.see you next year."
EvCh4wSw_n_WmCRoP-Cyxw,,I have been here a few times and every time the wait is ridiculous.  The food is great though.  I know most people come here for the char grilled oysters but my favorite dish is the fried catfish.,
EvD9dGHP5gI3HgqZUpRdgA,The hour long wait was easily forgotten once I took the first bite of my hot chicken sandwich -- there's a reason people wait hours to get this food. The spice and heartiness of the chicken was perfectly balanced by the crunch of the coleslaw and creamy secret sauce. 6 Stars.,,

EvaSd-BxhHKZfocCNSTAtg,"I actually ate at another location since the line here was far too long... Tip: the Chartlottes Avenue branch had a wait time of about 10 mins at 1.30pm. 

Honestly, maybe my expectations were too high from reading reviews...but fried chicken is fried chicken. It was nothing that blew me away. If you love fried chicken, then go ahead and wait but to me it certainly wasn't 'the best'. I would've been mad at myself if I waited over an hour for it. The mac and cheese was average, the potato salad too. The creamy coleslaw was not creamy at all, it was watery and it tasted odd. Imagine how the word 'damp' would taste, that's how it tasted. And the lemonade tasted like lemonade.

Would I recommend anyone wait for this chicken..no. Am I dying to go back? No.",,
Ew4v1qNldJPkbTodqtKtoA,If you want good Nashville Hot Chicken this is by far one of the places I would recommend. Expect a line when you arrive but it will be worth it. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and the sides are great. I like to get the damn hot because when I am eating hot chicken I want to know I am eating hot chicken. IF its your first time and you don't want to light yourself up then regular hot will do just fine. All the sides are good. I usually stick with potato salad for a cooling effect and fries. The mac and cheese is really good too. If you like hot chicken then you'll enjoy this visit. If you aren't ready to go down that road yet you can still get mild or medium and have yourself some good chicken while you laugh at your friend whom thought they could handle shut the cluck up.,,

Our group of 3 shared the following:
1) Hot fried chicken - very flavorful and hardly greasy
2) A Southern fried chicken wing (non-spicy) - very good 
3) A ""Shut the cluck up"" fiery hot chicken tender - I didn't try it, but my husband and friend were glad to have tried it (but both agreed that one bite was enough)!
4) Pimento mac and cheese - good, with a kick
5) Cole slaw - decent 
6) Fries - decent
7) Baked beans - good
8) Bread - average - the main purpose of the bread seemed to be absorbing any excess oil from the chicken 

They had a good beer selection.  The guys both enjoyed the Yazoo Hop Perfect IPA.

The order taker was friendly and patient.  The food did take a while to come out.  

The front outside patio was pleasant.  Come ready to share a table with other patrons.

Honestly it's more of a tourist trap than a place to get the best oysters you've ever had...

The oysters are solid, definitely good.  But, not worth an hour wait in line.

People like the ambiance; it's kind of a rite of passage type place...

Best oysters ever, no...  I have had better at several places.

If you're lucky enough to have no to minimal line its worth it, otherwise ""Just keep walkin'""...",
EzcISebuvh2erOiEjowIfA,"Ok Nashville, time for some tough love.  The hot chicken is good, but it's not worth a 45 minute wait.  If the place was empty, I would definitely eat here again and probably give it a 3.5.  If I saw a line out the door, I'd keep driving.  Also, for all the reviewer claiming that medium heat is HOT, they must never order spicy food.  If you like your wings HOT at other locations, go with the HOT at Hattie B's.",,

Finally we got seated, and of course we had to order the chargrilled oysters! We got a dozen, and it did not disappoint. IT WAS SO GOOD, I REALLY WANTED TO COME BACK! I will definitely come back if I'm ever back in NOLA.

My friend tried the oyster shooter. She liked it

We also got:
seafood entoufee- which was really delicious! I like it way more than gumbo
Fried peace maker po-boy- definitely lives up to being one of the best po boys!

The girl working at the register was friendly and made sure I had everything I needed before I left. The chicken was so good but definitely hot! I had to take breaks in order to eat all of it.

We were moved to the oyster bar and the servers there were not very friendly. When you are that close to your patrons, it is a good idea to be somewhat open to communication. It seemed as if we were a bother to them.

Being from Thibodaux La.,  which is 60 miles S/W of New Orleans, I know good RAW oysters and these are not them.  Sure they are huge and fresh and clean but they are flavorless. I ordered 3 dozen. 2 for me and 1 for my date. After the first dozen, it was like I was eating bland blobs of flesh. Not impressed at all w/ their RAW oysters. 

My date also ordered an oyster poboy and I will say this, it was one of the best I have ever had. The fried oysters were unreal, golden crispy and very flavorful. 

I say visit here for the fried oyster poboys and gumbo and cheap beer but eat the raw oysters elsewhere.",

I love hot chicken, chicken wings are my favorite thing to eat period , of course I read all the great reviews and saw the pictures that looked incredible but I was still like let's wait and see because I do consider my self a bit of a expert with all the hot wings I eat which is a lot . So my wife and I decided we got to go on our recent trip to Nashville so went about 11:30 am on a Sunday the line was long which we basically expected especially being a Sunday , recommend get there prior to opening to get in line. It took us an hour and forty minutes from line to receiving our food. I have to tell you though, it was totally worth the wait. Best chicken I've ever had! The wife and I got a large hot and large damn hot and shared them. Our sides were baked beans, mac and cheese, and greens. All were incredible and my wife liked the baked beans and she doesn't even like baked beans. The dam hot- word of caution- unless you like really spicy chicken do not get this one as it is no joke. Employees are very friendly and there is plenty of seating.","One of my wife's and I's favorite places anywhere and that says a lot considering it's in the best food city in the world . We had a bag of boiled Crawfish they were seasoned perfectly and delicious, had some raw oysters and chargrilled oysters the best oysters I have ever had nobody does chargrilled oyster as good as New Orleans they are unbelievable.

My wife had the crab cakes, oysters, and the Gumbo. Crab cakes were delicious, oysters I didn't try, not a fan, but the portion was huge. Comes with 6 huge oysters.

A group of us decided to stop by for lunch and luckily the line wasn't too long.  The restaurant doesn't have a waiting area inside so there's a greeter outside the doors to take your name and number of people in your party.  Just know that it's not more of a first come, first serve basis but rather the size of your party and whether or not there's a table small/big enough for your group.

After a 10 minute wait, we were seated by a very nice young lady who told us what the specials were and let us know our waitress would be with us shortly.  Unfortunately that didn't happen.  I'm not sure if they were short-staffed but our waitress took at least 5 minutes just to introduce Jerald and tell us she would be with us soon and another 5 minutes for her to actually make it to our table to take drink orders.  From this point on service was very sub-par.  Not sure if she was tired but I just didn't feel like she was patient with us and seemed to be in a rush to do something else.

Now to the food.  I had a bowl of the corn and lobster bisque and it was soooo good.  I recently had dental surgery soooo fried foods were not really and option.  French fries and the crab cakes worked for me as well and were seasoned so perfectly and the crab cakes weren't super bready.  Very good value for the amount of food I received.

My friends and I show up slightly hungover and hangry around noon on a Saturday, and what do we see? A line. Should have seen that one coming. However, the line moved pretty quickly, and before we knew it we were inside and had about 5 seconds to make our selections. Under pressure and overestimating the size of our stomachs, we all get the large white plate, medium. We all tried an array of sides, including the mac and cheese, collards, baked beans, cole slaw, and potato salad. All were delicious but the collards were the real standout. The slaw and potato salad were also good choices for cutting the heat of the chicken. The medium spiciness was the perfect amount of heat without being overbearing. What was overbearing, however, was how much food we got! 2 huge breats (hehe) and 2 wings. We all agreed we should have just gotten a small. Oh well, we stuffed our stomachs as much as we could bear, then walked it off at Centennial Park. Not a bad afternoon.

Sarah was still quick to tell us the kitchen was backed up but still ensured our water glasses never were  below half way . This was a great experience due to Sarah's knowledge of the menu .

It just didn't taste like homemade cobbler the way grandma used to make it. The crinkle cut fries were decent. I won't go back but I'm glad I at least tried it.

Staff was very friendly and helpful, they wore masks and gloves, of course we had to wear masks walking in. We were served very timely and did not have to ask for anything.

There were more people inside than I had expected but we were still pretty well distanced.

We had gumbo, gator bites, redfish (another burger for the kid who doesn't like fish) and Caesar salad.

I was all tasty - I have not had gator prepared this way, the pieces were much larger and had a little spice to them along with the remoulade sauce that came with them. I could have made a meal out of that alone. The redfish oceana was also very good.  Best redfish I have had in a while. The one who ordered the burger did like it so kids can eat here.  He did eat a lot of the gator tail though.

The gumbo was better here than a couple of other places we ate in NOLA, but none of them were just the way I like it - a little on the spicy side.  I am still looking for a really good ""cajun"" place in the NOLA area."
F7UFV9MdArk7EBxyDrSP6Q,,,We loved this place the food was delicious! Try to get there early on the weekdays to avoid the lines.
F7r-O720OT2qnxpFdx3Hag,"Chicken was okay.  We ordered medium and hot strips.   They didn't label the containers so I made the mistake of eating 2 strips of the hot ones when I ordered the medium. That just spoiled my tastebuds.  I OD'd on the paprika!  Yes, I know I should have known it was the hot one with the slather of paprika on the chicken!  :(

Mac & cheese was good.  The sauce wasn't too thick.  The black bean salad was good too. 

Not sure if I would come back to this place.  Surprised it was recommended by Food Network' DD&D.",,
F8_jeICkvrkLNPdfRYO_5g,,"AMAZING fresh oysters. Both raw and grilled were delicious, and only $15.99 for a dozen. I also had the soft shell crab poboy, which was good as well. If I had to do it again i'd just have three dozen oysters for lunch.",
F8oXcOVK9Em614xF-bGzAA,,,spent $12 on a stale chocolate muffin and a prepacked freezer burned ice cream. First time having good i haven't liked in nola so not too bad i guess?
F8sXuO6qOMutpcRpFxup1Q,We came here on a Saturday and the line was long. I believe we waited for like an hour and got poured on while being outside waiting. The chicken is spicy and not bad but to wait outside for like an hour not really. This chicken has it goes in spicy and will also come out spicy. I will like it if they bring a location down to Atlanta and might get it if lines are not crazy.,,
F8vzaNvNpobUU0HiVJx4dA,,,Best crawfish etouffee I've ever had. Kids fish/fries were super high quality. Gumbo real good too. Bowl is huge (almost a meal). Cup is tiny.
FA4bwfE9LWqgJMgWpJM1uQ,,,"So this was really one of my first NOLA dining experiences - it was right in-line with what I was expecting (for the better or worse).  Oceana certainly caters to the Bourbon St. tourist crowd with its cheesy decor, matching waiter attire / scripted welcoming, etc.  Aside from the food, there doesn't seem to be much that's genuine about this place...

But... there's the food.  I ordered the New Orleans sample plate thing... yes, VERY touristy of me, I know.  However, it might have required a scanning electron microscope to detect any food particles left on my plate.  Maybe I was starving?  Maybe I psychologically wanted the food to be so damn good that I would hoover my dish?  Maybe it was just a really, really tasty stuff!

I'd really like to go back to Oceana, but the area is so congested with obnoxious people and hyper-touristy venues, that I just don't feel like dealing with it.  Plus, I have a feeling I may not have had the best-in-class of what I ordered... it's like driving a Porsche for the first time, except that it's a Boxster, not a 911 GT2."
FA9P51DxuraJv6tRpge5HA,,Amazing oyster house!!!! Service was on point. Long line yet moves fast and totally worth the wait. The grilled oysters are different because of the added cheese. The bread pudding with whiskey is a must try!!!!!,
FAbLd3sUSNxrZXnMeOYy3A,"Hot chicken is a Nashville thing where you get, often times, really great fried chicken with an amazing hot sauce. Hattie B's is one of the places to go to that is in the category of ""not to be missed"" ... we (four of us) stopped on the way to the airport and had one of the best meals of the trip.",,
FBAnxJwLBKsWH_GTVsjskw,"I don't think the batter here really tastes like anything and is just spicy for the sake of being hot, I know it's popular with tourists but I think there are a dozen of much better hot chicken restaurants in Nashville.",,
FBQeV-3dDdkm3GrVgWY1Ow,,,"I truly enjoyed my dinner at Oceana. One I want to commend them on A-1 service. We were a small group of four but David was an excellent server. Full of knowledge of the dishes and menu as a whole. 
Every dish we had was delicious. I had the barbecue shrimp ($20) 10 jumbo size shrimp and bread for the sauce. I also ordered the side of red beans and rice ($4).

Because I was headed to Bourbon next I avoided a cocktail here and just had the sweet tea. It was good. 

I would certainly come back again. Excellent food and service paired with a great location in the Quarter.

Good for groups. My friends and I were there in Jan 2016"
FBV9kjY9rb6kIt0YlCN-Mg,,,This place had the best charbroiled oysters I've ever tasted! The wait wasn't long considering the Essence festival going on. I also tried duck for the first time here and let's just say I'll only eat it again at Oceana with extra crawfish gravy.
FBZkam7cubcd-ycSJlyBgQ,"Wonderful chicken, I am a wimp so I get it without any spicy sauce.  Still has great flavor!  Very good ranch!!!",,
FBd1Qjnnc1Loh7ZY7FD9Zg,"Ok, so Hattie B's has BOOMED in business since our trip here two years ago. Be prepared to wait in line, but know that the wait is worth it. 

The cashier is cool and kind, and won't pressure you into order quickly, even though there is a line behind you. 

I'm not a spice lover, but my husband is, so this review is of both the mild and hot levels. 

The chicken is PERFECT. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Resting on a bread bed and topped with a side of pickles, this entree is greeted by two sides of your choice. Between the two of us, we had the baked beans, pimento Mac and cheese, cole slaw, and fries. Go for the chicken, not the sides. 

You may have to wait for a seat, but even with four people, the timing of people leaving was perfect, and we didn't have to wait at all.",,
FBfHrbU8OvTrP5jafNnQqA,,"Lives up to the hype. Get everything you can.  The wait is worth it. 

Chargrilled oysters were amazing. 

Jambalaya was awesome. 

Raw oysters were so fresh. 

Peacemaker po-boy was really good too.

Get all of it!!!",
FBrGpf7eNOkghEXze4HsxQ,,,"Was here back in 2015 and the service and food was much better. Maybe it was due to the time of day, should not matter. The red beans and rice are awesome and the hurricanes are the strongest in the quarter if you ask me"
FBtWEeoBAfaYQbjgFVakFQ,,"I would say 3.5 stars.

The first time we tried, the oysters were awesome! Do use the house cocktail sauce as it adds a good kick to the flavor. Fresh though a ted smaller than expected. Second time even smaller and not as fresh. 

I like the catfish poboy the best, crispy and tasty. The gumbo might have been better without the crawfish, which we dont like much, it tasks really fresh with the crawfish in the mix though.","Was a bit disappointed, though we only ordered the classic burger and bean soup.

Wasn't bad but not special either. Will be back to try more items next time in New Orleans."
FC1ZSB9fd4WlDMSAbEjq8Q,,"If you don't want to line up, come at an odd time. We came here at 3:30 pm to each lunch and there was no line. We walked straight in. 
I was very excited to the char grilled oysters. We got a dozen of them. WOW. All I can see is WOW. Imagine eating large juicy oysters covered in warm cheese. They were so good that I almost ordered another dozen of them. Of course we drank Hurricanes because when you are in NOLA, that's what you do.
For my main, I had the New Orleans Medley. This is great for indecisive people who want to try everything. The medley includes tasting portions of gumbo, jambalaya, beans & rice, grilled smoked sausage. Everything was good. Its nice to not to have to commit to one dish. Why commit to one thing when you can have it all? 
No trip to NOLA is complete without going to ACME oyster bar! You must go!",
FCPVw3JwGq8WU42lVdwsCg,"Short wait outside , went in between the lunch and dinner rush. Absolutely amazing , staff was friendly and quick . We had a dark meat plate and tried the chicken sandwich. Beer was cold chicken was hot can't beat the combo. Chicken was flavorful and juicy, would recommend to anyone",,
FCrS8z5ri8zfu7ekcDxkTQ,"This is great southern fried chicken.  The heat is mainly in the batter, so if you want to be adventurous, order one chicken finger super spicy.  Enjoy a plate of chicken to your liking and share the spicy with your friends.  It may bring a tear to your eye! Go during lunch or early dinner to avoid crowd.",,
FD4XwAqKnZG-19K6YNhrPQ,,,One of our favorites when we visit New Orleans. Crab cakes are excellent! Always get great service. Never had a bad meal or food item.
FD5bNdHMupNIHZ8KZxGsNQ,,,Our first night in New Orleans we hit the jackpot!  We chose to eat at the bar rather than wait for a table. I'm so glad we did. Our bartender was a wonderful woman who also served as our waitress. She was so friendly and helpful when deciding what to order. We both chose one of the nights specials. All I can say is that was my favorite meal during our trip. It was shrimp pasta with a crab cake on top and grilled cat fish on top of the crab cake in the most delicious sauce. You must try this restaurant!! You will not regret it.
FDLKt8fZRq1Ug4f67-nCbg,,"Really, really enjoyed our lunch!

I didn't actually eat any oysters- everyone else in the group sampled the chargrilled oysters and loved them! I had the seafood gumbo which was absolutely amazing. I also split a burger with my mom and it was the best burger I've had in New Orleans.

Server was very attentive and quick. Would definitely come back, just make sure you come on a weekday so you don't deal with a long line.",
FDoynHHw_bwM7LTfJ7fbNg,"I ordered the a hot chicken sandwich and a no heat sandwich. My friends had the no heat one and were very happy. I ate the hot one. I enjoy spicy food and this was a good level of heat. Texturally the chicken was great. The flavor was great. I personally prefer chicken a little crispier on the outside, but honestly this sandwich was delicious. The line to dine inside was pretty long but there was a very short one to order to go which is what we did. Waited under 20 minutes.",,
FDx8acId25giY7_jkikYgg,"This was our first stop on our trip to Nashville. We went on a Friday afternoon and there was a line down the street. That being said, it was worth the wait! The chicken was SO good. A little tip if it's your first time visiting, order ahead online and skip the line!",,
FEDOIyOKwgUBsFQeCRpZ5A,"The dark wings were tender and juicy. I recommend the southern flavored wings for classic tenders. Their collard greens and close law was awesome sides with the all of the fried food. The Mac and cheese had a little kick but was flavorful. 

The ""shut the cluck up"" flavored wings were ridiculously hot. My boyfriend describes it as ""once you taste the chicken, the flavor surely gets hot. But it gets so hot that it hurts to breathe after a couple of seconds"" LOL. So be warned before buying them to try. Lol.  

Since I love sweet things, the peach cobbler is a must!!! The crust and right amount fruit and pudding filling was so yum!!",,
FEIfF5z8KssXUd_yo-TcoA,,,"After traveling 9 hours to New Orleans, all  we wanted to do was enjoy some delivery food and relax. We called at 8:13 pm and placed our order. (Crab cakes, po boy and shrimp jambalaya). We were told it would be about an hour wait, which was fine. An hour and twenty minutes later the food arrived. We specifically made sure to ask, 'there is silverware, correct?' We were reassured there was silverware. The delivery guy left and we found no silverware or napkins. It's a little difficult to eat pasta without silverware. We called back and very nicely let them know we didn't get the silverware or napkins. We were told it would be on its way. Long story short and multiple calls later, we finally received a new pasta dish and silverware. This process was almost 3 hours long. The delivery person had our hotel front desk call our room  and ask if we would come down and get the food. No. She came up and delivered the food clearly irritated that she was asked to bring it to our room. She then said  that her manager wanted the uneaten food back. Almost 3 hours later we are sitting down to eat dinner.  We are very sad to say that our first dining experience in New Orleans was so poor."
FEfPVh8la9nisIHkUtGTaQ,"Delicious hot chicken, and just the right amount of spice on the Mild flavor for us weak ones. The Mac n cheese and potato salad were my favorite sides and the lemonade is perfectly sweetened.

The story behind Hattie B's is also very funny (heard on the trolley tour of Nashville but is on website too, apparently).

We got lucky I guess because when we showed up on early Tuesday evening there was no line and got our food fast but apparently the line can get pretty long during the weekends so go early!",,
FEfhEkMbLl9iD9SuR4GHqQ,,,"We were very happy with our choice to go here last night.  Our wait was only about 5 minutes.  Our server was knowledgeable and pleasant.   Drinks were good (I recommend the Sazarac) and the food was great.  My redfish on crawfish corn bread was amazing.  Someone else had the crab cake pasta, also very good.  Even the ribeye (I know) was good.  Portions are generous but not overwhelming.  Thumbs up."
FEsLHDs02tNk4glgIzTQ-g,,"I will start by saying, The wait is not worth it. We waited outside for 30-40 Minutes, so compared to other reviews and their wait time we got lucky! We ordered half a dozen raw oysters and half a dozen chargrilled. YES,they were messy Not rinsed or anything! Your hands will
Have mud all over them because they don't even rinse them before serving.  The waitress didn't even bring up
Clean napkins. YES, there were shell Piece we had to repeatedly after every single bite take out of our mouths. NO, The Gumbo was not the best, extremely bland and barely warm. YES, The Fish Po Boy was good for the most part. I did read some reviews that stated the staff was friendly, weren't the friendliness last night. Only person that greeted us was the security at the door! Lol We won't be returning or suggesting. A waste of our time and money.",
FF1y4UCLBRF1MdVeNEYonQ,,,"Have never had a worse salad in my life. The lettuce was both wilted or FROZEN, it was like biting into ice, or better yet I found a small hair in my dressing. Really?! I ordered to go, maybe they were careless thinking I'd walk out and notice later (being too late to complain). Never again."
FFF_PvLUkEdNV77GyqIluQ,,"For being off of Bourbon Street this was good food.  It her was a line to get in but not too bad. The place defiantly has a cool New Orleans vibe to it. Unfortunately it had the smell of the street was near. That was my only issue. 

The chargrilled oysters were great. Just the right amount of spice and butter. Bread was fresh too. Defiantly worth the experience!",
FFSS1B1C1g9jRoLjf26SuA,Delicious hot chicken in a well themed/decorated place. Came at 1030 on a Monday and waited in a short line. Hot is about medium at Party Fowl (taste test winner). Mac and cheese is a must and overall totally worth the calories :),,
FFaF_EZMfzDR8C415uFP2g,"Stopped in on the drive to Atlanta. The service from the waiter was great. The line was around the building and we waited 45 min to get in and order. The food came out fast - the wait was mostly due to people hanging around after they were done with their meal and of course because the food was great! Good service, great food . Will be returning .",,
FFdir9oS0oZu-Ok2kkYn2A,,"I was on a solo trip visiting the city and heard great things about Acme! I sat at the bar and the ladies working it were fantastic. Great atmosphere and music playing. Definitely Saturday evening vibes. 

I had the gumbo and shrimp po boy. The po boy was okay i expected more flavor especially since I'm from Florida however the Gumbo was really good and the star of the night for me. 

Main problem was the wait.  I was by myself and it still took over 40 minutes to get in and seated so make sure you plan ahead if stopping by this establishment. 

Until next review 
Kisses",
FGE6nUllyMLn6jRHoHGwBw,Top notch chicken. Chicken so good you will what to slap your momma. This is truly one of Nashvilles best hot chicken restaurant.,,
FGmWx0hFD-h3YuTEql1x2Q,,"Chargrilled oysters- yes!

We arrived early for lunch on Monday (2/11/19) thinking that the line would be down the street and around the corner.  We stood in line for about 30 min before we went inside to have a seat.  I didn't think that was bad at all.

Our server was a little slow and the French fries weren't that great but everything else was amazing and very tasty.

Order 
Platter - fried soft shelled crab(1) with fries and hush puppies $16.99

Side of red beans & rice $3.99

Chargrilled oysters (6) $11.99

The oysters were served with a few slices of bread that we dipped in the leftover butter sauce on the palate, yummy!  The oysters were delicious!  I could eat those all day.

The red beans and rice was very tasty.

The platter - the hush puppies were fantastic, the fries soft shelled crab was delightful.  The fries were not that great.

The meal was wonderful, service was a bit slow but over all I would definitely come back.  

I saw some po boys being serviced and they looked so good, I want to try one of those next time I go back.




TIP - they don't want you taking pictures of the guy cooking the oysters. I don't know, I didn't ask.  The guy sprayed the window as I was trying to take a pic.

** kids menu = no",
FGv4qoT8dZ-j6_7EttbPgg,,,We loved this place! The best greens I've ever tasted. The fish was seasoned to a T! We actually visited twice in two days.

They both have different uet amazing flavors! my husband and i had a dozen of each! awesome! u can taste the freshness! The crawfish étouffée was heaven!

It will be the highlight of all your dining in New Orleans. Softshell crab is quite good as well. Lastly, look for Steve at the bar. He'll take great care of you!",
FHRKrOV38ySbaidNO-XQrA,,,This is known for seafood with New Orleans flair but we enjoyed breakfast here even more. The Pain Perdu was truly awesome. Service was great and atmosphere was super. Something for everyone.
FHV9p4P7ZEu4PYMDsFzu8g,I tried the medium hot large dark platter. It came with 2 legs and thighs. I should have gotten the damn hot level of hotness. The levels of hotness taste less hot than you might think. Everyone in my group wished that they would have ordered the hotter level. The chicken was moist and the skin was done perfectly. The black eyed pea salad was delicious. You get free refills on drinks which is nice and the staff is friendly.,,
FH_2UqQAMEsSr9rULwC2Ow,"HECK YES !!!
Hattie B's is a MUST when in Nashville!
We arrived late (9:55), and they close at 10:00.
They were supper friendly, helpful, informative and just showed us a great time!
The chicken strip plate I chose , came with 3 fingers (1 HOT & 2 Mild).
My sides were, crinkled cut fries, slaw and baked beans. Excellent choices!! 
My meal was just as good as I thought it would be! I must say that the portions are very large! The strips are Huge!
While we were finishing up with our meal, the staff were busy cleaning everything up.
Usually, you might get rushed out, because everyone is tired. Not so at Hattie B's!!
Everyone was so friendly, telling us about the place, other locations and possibly new towns they are coming to.
One of the best things about Hattie B's is that they donate the remaining food they have to a homeless shelter!!!!
That is what every restaurant should do !
I wish I could give more than 5 Stars, they deserve it!!
When in Nashville, go give them a try.
Go get Full",,

So the greeter pursued me explaining that they're a busy restaurant and they can't have split parties. Half the tables were empty! I pointed that out this person and we moved our friend from the bar to a table over his protests. I wanted to walk out, except my friend was still eating. It turns out I should have walked out.

FIN3o4mxiSqVolpvKVsiGA,,"If see you see the line and wonder if it's really worth wait...I'm telling you it is!!

We (my BF and I)stayed down the street at the Courtyard..and every time, no matter what time of day it was, there was always a line to get in. Of course that got our curiosity as we've seen a number, and I mean a number of oyster restaurants and none of them had a line like this place. 

Being this was our first time in NO, we wanted to try a little bit of everything. We decided on our last night, no matter how long the line was, we needed to see for ourselves. 

We had asked a few locals and all of them said Acme was just like everywhere else. My BF was hesitant to wait on line knowing we were told this but as we got on line, a customer from across the street at Felix's Oyster House literally left his order on the table said he tried 3 of his dozen oysters and went to Acme. He said he's been going to acme for over 10 years now and was told by the locals the same thing and decided he'd try it. That was enough to convince my BF to stay on line. 

We waited for about an hour and OMG was it worth the wait! I'm a a foodie and frequent traveler. I use yelp reviews to decide where we will eat and although I read reviews, I rarely write reviews. This place was soooo good that I had to write one. 

We ordered the chargrilled oysters and wow oh wow...the buttery deliciousness made the wait worth it. 

My BF ordered the boo fries as an appetizer. The description of the fries wasn't something I was looking forward to but what a surprise, the fries were so good. 

As entrees my BF ordered the fried shrimp/fish dinner with coleslaw. Now, I love fried fish and have had fried fish from North Carolina and other southern states but this was AMAZING!! The batter was crisp. The fish was perfectly flaky and not a typical fish taste you would think it had. It was hands down the best fried fish I've ever had!! The coleslaw was even great!

I ordered the shrimp etouffee. It was flavorful as well.

Although I can't give you a comparison to the other oyster restaurants, I can tell you everything we ordered was worth the wait!!

The next time I am back...I will be sure to come again!",
FISzlNZgrFylvgX3Nl_a5w,,"Extremely arrogant restaurant.  Instead of ""a New Orleans tradition since 1910"", it should be ""treating patrons poorly since 1910""!   Clearly surviving on the hype!  

Greasy, no flavor (fried) appys.  Chargrilled Oysters were full of grit & shell!   Crab cake was very good, but quite a bit of shell so chew gingerly (4 star).   Deserts were pretty decent tho...banana foster, bread pudding & a chocolate thing in a martini glass.  

Nasty-mean hostess & servers full of attitude!   We had a reservation for a large party.   Had confirmed ahead of the booking they could handle/accommodate a large party (24)...no problem.  Gave us all the assurances it would be good.  We arrived (cold, rainy night) but were missing 2 people.  They wouldn't seat us and made us wait outside.  Then gave away our table.  We were finally seated (party of 22) over 2 tables with empty seats at our 2nd table that they seated strangers at rather than let our latecomers sit there.....said they had to wait in line & be seated as available; they left (wish I had gone with them!)!!  

Only bright spot was the 2nd server that showed up to serve our party....wish I knew her name.   She was lovely.  

You will leave here smelling like fried food & need to wash your hair.  

Don't waste your time.  There are waaaaay too many other options where you could actually enjoy the food & Nola southern hospitality.",
FIXp8R_105-736buUs_e_A,This is a GREAT hot chicken place. The spice levels are on targt. The medium was hot but still had a lot of flavor. The cold beer goes well with the hot chicken. This is a go to place for hot chicken. Been to both locations. They have same quality but parking is better on Charlotte.,,
FIf0HWj3RqiOo-KEyxzOjA,,,I came to N'awlings to celebrate my birthday and my food experiences have been dismal. However before partying on Bourbon St. Yesterday (May 14th) my BFF and I wanted to grab something to eat. So we went to Oceana. We were sat right away and must admit we were a little difficult because we asked to change tables a couple times. One room was to cold (I get cold easily) and one room was nice but we noticed outside seating. Best decision ever because then we had Kevin H. as our server and he was amazing!! He was so polite he was fast and new the menu. Speaking off menu we had seafood gumbo and crab cakes and it was to die for!! I'm very pleased with this restaurant and we thanked the manager on the way out. This place is a gem with great service and food. What more could you ask for?!
FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,,"There were two places in the French Quarter that my husband had reviewed and wanted to try, this was one of them.  On our first day in town, this place had a long line outside waiting for a table, so we went down the street for the backup plan.  

Eventually, we made it in without a long wait.  We got the raw oysters, but also got the char boiled ones,  we also got a couple of their sandwiches.  The oysters were fresh, fairly big in size, had came with lemon wedges and a tangy cocktail sauce.  It all went well with ice cold beer!

I enjoyed these and wouldn't hesitate to go back!",

She answered questions and made suggestions without rushing you along which I really appreciated. Being the wimp I am, i ordered a small plate ""Southern"" heat level...0 heat! For around $9-10 you get either white or dark 2piece,whatever spice level you want and two sides. To add an extra side, it's only $.50 more so of course I did that. The sides I had were pimento mac & cheese, black eye pea salad, and greens. The chicken was so crispy and tasty and very enjoyable because there was no spice haha (my friends ordered the medium and hot which I did try and IT WAS HOT. LIKE REALLY HOT. I just can't do spicy fried chicken. I prefer to add hot sauce to keep things under control lol). The greens were good with a bit of a kick to them which I did enjoy. The black eye pea salad was my favorite side-served cold with chopped bell peppers in a vinaigrette type dressing (it reminded me of peas with chow-chow if you're southern). The only disappointment was the mac & cheese! It wasn't baked/home style, but more of the noodles in a cheese sauce type. The flavor was fine but a bit bland. 

I will be back to Hattie B's whenever I'm in Nashville!",,
FIxH6YIRssA2kvHPXGxnwA,,,The kind waiter recommended a po'boy to me which I'd pass along to any other person reading reviews. I got the char grilled catfish po'boy which was really good (they do their boys with their own individual coleslaw tho instead of their the traditional lettuce and tomato so if you're not a fan maybe skip the po'boy). But what sold me was the gator bites. I was eager to try some gator and the waiter gave me some suggestions on what to order. Needless to say I loved it and went back a second time just for the gator!

Everything on the menu is really heavy, and most things are fried. I got a fried eggplant poboy that was just not good. Greasy, flavorless, etc.

I'm happy so many people have had good experiences here, but it's not a place I would go. Many other options in the French Quarter. I wish the menu was more diverse to include fresher fare."
FJQkNJ7JJpIImbOcA14NcQ,,Excellent food! The place to go for your fried seafood fixings. My friends and I enjoyed everything we ordered. We had the fried fish platter and you can taste the freshness in the fish and it wasn't too greasy or oily. The seafood gumbo was delicious. We also had the fried peace maker po-boy and it had great flavors and nice soft crunch from the bread.,

He literally had us laughing the whole time. It's crazy how knowledgeable he is about the menu. Super friendly guy and a real genuine guy. I hate when people try to pretend like they're someone else when serving but, we all loved his personality! Aside from the service, the food was delicious! All of Rons recommendations were great! Food IS spicy but it's so flavored that the spice doesn't overpower the taste of the food!"
FJp2lGy4Nda5coeHqPw-jg,,,"This place was amazing! We came here after checking into our hotel to get some dinner. Our server was super friendly and polite. We had crab cakes for an appetizer, they kicked off our meal to a great start. The seafood platter was huge (and yummy) and enough to feed at least two people. The blackened chicken was also delicious! When we are in the area again we will surely be coming back for more!"
FJqtTcgSR6BT09UT7gif0A,,,"From reading the previous reviews, I was expecting a delicious meal; however, I was sorely disappointed. I ordered takeout through yelp after finding that I was not ""in the delivery range."" I ordered the gator bites, crab cakes, gumbo, shrimp platter, and the pecan bourbon pie.

After getting back to my hotel, I found that the gator bites were missing. The gumbo was okay but nothing you cant get better elsewhere. The crab meat cakes stated they were supposed to come with a crawfish mushroom sauce which was missing as well. Therefore the crab cakes were a little dry and flavorless. The shrimp platter was also not great. Lastly, the bourbon pecan pie slice was very small and the whipped cream was spoiled.

All in all, while this has a very nice looking interior and had a very nice staff, the food was lackluster and I would not recommend it."
FJwNDYw0ojHzIU2K6cdnXA,,"The oysters (char grilled & raw) were absolutely delicious!! The soft shell Po boy sandwich was so tasty!! The gumbo was a delight! Very great food. We stood in line outside for about a hour and a half in 20 degrees so even though that sucked, the food was worth it. The issue came about when a waitress walking passed dropped a whole platter tray of ice cold sauces and juices down my back. She apologized but laughed the entire time which was very embarrassing and uncomfortable for me. The manager came over very briefly and said ""oh I heard we almost had an issue, good to see things are okay"" and walked away while I literally was wringing my coat and sweatshirt out. It could have been handled more appropriate definitely. The food, A1... the service can use a little work!",

FL7q5_6PrlwAxaP7C9qukg,Crowded but very good chicken! Loved the crispy chicken and French fries. Good lemonade. Fast service.,,
FLGFtGbXaUo0obR6lnZA1Q,,"Definitely an overrated restaurant.   Really can't figure out what the fuss was about. 

To start I had the charred oysters which were confusing.  The osyters didn't have any of the fresh sea taste and was overwhelmed by the buttery garlic sauce.  The buttery garlic sauce was pretty good for bread dipping though.  

Next I split the soft shell crab poboy and the shrimp and oyster poboy.  I do recommend the softshell crab.  This was the only place i saw such a dish and the crab was nice, big, and crunchy.  I didn't see anything special about the shrimp and oyster poboy though.  Just over priced. 

The place is busy and the service was not all that great.   First, there's always a line to get in.  I tried going for lunch but there was a line so decided to go early for dinner at 5 and still a line. (Line does move faster than expected.)   I had to ask the server for more bread twice and had to look for the waitress to get my soda refilled long after I needed it.   

I say that there are other restaurants in New Orlean to be discovered and I will not be returning.

I also had food poisoning the next day.  I'm pretty sure it was from one of the dishes I mentioned in the review.

Probably more of a 3 star place but giving it two stars to balanced out the bloated reviews and due to the possible food poisoning.",

I have food allergies, so there was very little I could eat.  However, my husband had the gumbo, and he said it was very good.  The management was very kind to let me know they use Tony Chachere's seasoning, which is definitely full of msg.  They are unable to prepare certain foods for those of us who have allergies because they get everything from corporate and corporate wants everyone to have the same experience at all of their restaurant locations.  It is a fun place, the food smells yummy, but unfortunately we will not go back because they cannot accommodate folks with food allergies.",

Another part of a star lost because the white guy at the door who was responsible for seating people did not seem to enjoy his job or his existence. I wanted to leave at that point but after waiting so long I didn't push the issue. So I have a strict diet and the server, Morris, was very patient with me. We found something that worked for me but when it came out, the cheese on the sandwich was melted and I couldn't take it off. I ordered it with the cheese only because my friend was going to eat half. I didn't know any part of the sandwich was going to be hot. Not Morris' fault though since I didn't ask. Anyway he was apologetic and I told him not to be. He gave me another option and so I went with that. When he came back he said his manager wanted to double check that everything on my new item was something I could eat and that the first sandwich was on the house since it was a mix up. I wasn't expecting that at all and my friends were happy because they got to have it. Morris was very very good to us and super polite. 

On another note, when we tried to go the night before the line was at least a block long. I'd never seen anything like it for a food place when there are plenty of similar ones in the area. By the time we left our early lunch, there were at least 30 people in line. I honestly don't think it's that serious. People in the area told is more than once that there are better/similar places in the area. My friends really liked the food though. My sandwich was regular but the bread is really good. To me, it's kind of expensive there but I'm a cheap ass.",

We circled a few times but we were able to find parking for free!! There's a ton of pay stations around if not. The wait was long - about an hour outside but there was free water. When we got in, we realized we rather eat outside because inside is just too busy. The outside is lit pretty. We shared a table to help people find seats easier. There is not that many seats but people move in and out quickly. I don't love hot so I ordered a medium chicken tenders, fries and max and cheese. Boyfriend got the half plate but hot. Wow, I was blown away! Everything was spicy - including the fries. I couldn't finish my meal so I took a bunch home! I was really full and the spice overwhelmed me but if you love spice this is your place. They let you have take home boxes if you ask inside at the counter. Everything was cooked well and the portions were large! I say worth the experience",,
FOjWOTVEQyjChNghH-JoFQ,,"What's a trip to New Orleans without a visit to Acme Oyster House? I've got plenty of reviews to write after my recent trip to the Big Easy, but I had to start with Acme. 

The chargrilled oysters are the absolute truth. Our table of 7 started with an order of two dozen, just to see how they were. After our first bites, we immediately flagged down our waiter and put in another order. 

The rest of the food was .. good? I'm sure it's hard for all the other dishes to consistently be in the chargrilled oysters' shadow, but my seafood étouffée was tasty (albeit a bit salty). 

I'll mention here that Acme won't seat your party unless you're all actually there, and while our group waited for one person, we were politely declined entrance to the bar and told ""it's not a waiting area."" I recommend arriving early, and with your whole party!",

I ordered the hot, and it was definitely that but not overpowering.  Sides we ordered were pimento mac and cheese, beans, and fries all of which I thought were great.  My gripe is that the meat is woefully undersalted and the rub/paste they put on it comes across as a little bitter.  We'll be back.",,

FPBoO_mRVx6bcCz7EJ-cdA,,,"Oceana grill does have some tasty Étouffée ($18, add grilled crawfish for +$5) but that's where the praise for this place stops.

The ambiance is feels more like a back room / basement than a French quarter bistro. 

Back to the food...

Grilled Oysters? ... ""Yes, please!""  
Cream sauce finish... ""Who Dat?""

I realize that they need to differentiate themselves from the mainstream but this grilled oyster fan gives Oceana a big thumbs down. The grilled oysters comes out with a sad hunk of bread smothered in the cream-butter-cheese sauce over a weird bed of wilted lettuce. (Hot oysters and lettuce?)

The seafood gumbo (bowl, $10) had an okay base but then it had four sad shrimp in it. Where's the seafood?

Both the Étouffée and Gumbo were served with three thin slices of the same sad French bread. :(. Not even toasted rounds. Honestly, saltine crackers would have been better. 

Definitely a meal wasted in NOLA."

All of our sides (which we shared) were great, especially the greens and the pimento Mac and cheese.  While we shouldn't have, we tried the banana pudding for dessert and we're glad we did.

FPPE1PGnZ2fKfNJSD7EFPQ,"I went to Nashville for the weekend and everyone told me that I had to check this place out. Their website has the full menu in which you can place an order in advance so you don't have to wait in the ridiculous long line at the actual restaurant. They have platters/combos of chicken that come with 2 sides and you can add an additional side for just 50 cents! When I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my online order, the line was way out the door and there was no seating available at all in the restaurant. They have a separate door that you can use if you are picking up an order.

The pickup process seemed a little disorganized as there were still multiple people trying to pick up their orders at the same time so I actually got my order 10 minutes later than my scheduled time and had to wait a little bit at the restaurant. For my order, I got jumbo chicken tenders, a half bird, mac and cheese, fries, and banana pudding. You can choose from 5 different seasonings for your chicken ranging from Southern to Mild to Shut the Cluck Up. I opted for Southern and Hot to try 2 types. The Hot was hotter than I expected as in spicier than the usual ""hot"" buffalo wings. My favorite sides were the fries which were similar to those of Zaxby's and the banana pudding.

The place lived up to its hype but I am soooo glad I ordered online ahead of time. I am not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much if I stood waiting outside for a long time in the heat!",,

Chargrilled oysters, raw oysters, oysters shooters, boo fries, étouffée, gumbo, fried seafood platter, and 2lbs crawfish that was given to us in house! New plates and clean table every time new dishes arrived. Everyone from our group ate so fast we didn't look up once to talk to each other.

All the recommended items were topped with the same Alfredo sauce, their famous oysters, crab meat cakes, madi gras pasta. Everything was lackluster in flavor and spice. 
But the review is mainly for the service. We were first in line but at least 5 parties behind us were seated first. After 30 minutes of waiting, we were led inside the restaurant to wait some more as our table was finishing setting up. One of hostess then told us we were BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE. What?! Just sit us at our table if that was the issue! How long does it really take to place a few sets of silverware?! 
However, the manager gave us a 10% by checking in. Nice gesture, but based on that experience alone, I can assure I won't miss going back."
FRbzIsH7QteIdG5Q7OCVqA,This place is the ideal hot chicken spot. It's small with patio seating but it feels very homey. The chicken was some of the best fried chicken I have ever had. In the category of hot chicken it was the best. I got the small white meat plate with potato salad and coleslaw. The potato salad was amazing. It was so delicious and the perfect balance to the chicken. All I can say is this will be a place I frequent on my trips to Nashville.,,

He made great suggestions, was honest about what he thought was great on the menu and just overall provided the service that you want when you visit NOLA.

FTUGQNrBa4AwdFCsCaw5MQ,"tl;dr I shed a couple tears writing this review. My heart longs for the next time we meet again. Subpar sides but the dark meat chicken was next level.

Hattie B's wasn't hard to find. Even though it seems like a place for a quick bite, there was a line extending way down the block when we came. I can't say the line was short, it took us about 25 min to move up maybe 30 spots? 

Once we were in the food came fast. I got the dark meat half chicken combo at a medium spice level, along with mac & cheese and collard greens. Honestly I didn't think the sides were that great. Maybe I'm not a fan of greens in general, but the mac and cheese was a little watery and not very flavorful. The chicken, on the other hand, was phenomenal. I wish I had tried a higher spice level, since the medium was just registering for me. Overall though, probably the crispiest, juiciest, most flavorful chicken I've had in a while. Definitely lives up to the hype.",,

I had the 10-napkin roast beef po boy, which was just ok....kind of salty and the ""roast beef"" was more like pot roast.  And I only needed 5 napkins.  The bloody mary was kind of weak and came in a small plastic cup.

That chicken was fried chicken perfection - piping hot, juicy, perfectly spiced perfection. I ordered mine medium, and it was the perfect amount of heat...not too hot, just right.

We ordered the gumbo, Cajun jambalaya pasta, fried shrimp po-boy, blackened chicken platter, and catfish lafouche. We expected the gumbo to be spicy; however, it did have balanced flavors and the shrimp wasn't overcooked. The Cajun jambalaya pasta was our favorite dish. The Creole sauce was creamy and the alligator sausage was a great accompaniment to the dish. The fried shrimp po-boy had a little more remoulade than to our liking. Nonetheless, the shrimp was crispy and not oily at all. The spice on the blackened chicken had a good level of heat and was served with jambalaya. The catfish lafouche was recommended to us by our server, Derrick. It was a great sample of the different tastes of New Orleans! The catfish and crawfish were so delicious together. Overall, this was a great first experience of Cajun/Creole cuisine."
FY8tAdKjRbldmI1x8AtBMQ,,,"Had late lunch here on Friday as a recommendation from Cajun Encounters... Boy what a wonderful experience. We were seated right away & our waiter was on point!!! Shrimp poboy was delish!!! & gumbo super yomo.  Drinks were right on as well, 3 bahama mamas & 1 tropical storm & we ended up in tummy heaven. 
Can u tell I love it. Excellent spot!!!"
FYGk3GLazImbflJMiIhoSw,"In the battle of Hattie B's vs Prince's, Prince's wins out if we're just comparing the chicken. While the flavors and skin of the chicken was very good, the meat itself was a little bit dry. Even so, if I lived in Nashville, I'd probably eat here every day. The big advantage Hattie B's has over Prince's is that they have better sides. The cole slaw was probably the best cole slaw I've ever eaten and helped a lot with the heat and dryness of the chicken. The mac and cheese was good but a little too thick for me. I also ordered the bean salad and thought it was ok. Prices were super reasonable and staff were super nice. A woman in line in front of my boyfriend and I was in a wheel chair and the staff not only pushed her inside but also took her order at the table instead of making her order at the front cashier. Being from the Northeast, I don't usually see that kind of Southern hospitality. Even though there's always a long line outside Hattie B's, this is definitely a must if you are in Nashville.",,
FYJi86KtW6C5WdafVVLRGA,,,Was expecting more in terms of ambience and food quality. More of a bar feel that a upscale seafood restaurant. The blackened alligator was delicious and perfectly seasoned.
FYYET0tl-o_JqlCjv_pB8g,,"The grilled oysters were very good, but rest of meal just average including the Seafood Gumbo and Seafood Etoufee.  The Hurricane was good!",
FYkmMPyU1eMgf_JFsW4ZUA,,Had grilled oysters which were incredible.  Son had oysters poboy and loved it.  Seems to be always crowded.  Good size portions.,
FYnOK0c-wAMx-UaNajX4Sw,,,"I ordered the crab cakes as a meal. I am from MD so I know a good crab cake. This crab cake was delicious....however, it was like fried. A thick crust around the meat that I was not used to at all. Soooooo I ate all the insides of the crab cake and left the fried outer part on the plate. The insides was very good....full of meat and not a lot of filler. There crab cakes were top with a mushroom cream sauce and little crawfish. It was overall a pretty decent meal."
FYoPs3zq8H9BTSM1JcpHww,,,If you have not been here you a truly missing out on great food. The waiters are so nice and friendly service next to none. We had a little wait because so many people was trying to get here too lol. But it is worth the wait trust me. The crab cakes flawless. The pasta was banging. The red fish was almost perfect. And the gator bites yummy. The drinks are strong too that's always a good thing especially in New Orleans.
FZQXGfmkMASFWq3JnuQZqg,,"The Cajun food was alright, but the seafood is the true winner here.  Oysters cooked all ways are spectacular and the fried catfish was the most tender, well cooked piece of fried fish I've had in NOLA.  Don't need to say more about this place that hasn't been said already.  So when you're in town this place is a must-try!",
FZapXuobPhI788fgTxeiYw,I've lived in Nashville for 2 years and this is hands down my fav fried chicken place ever. I miss it so much,,
FZpgKsXzXy4HPU-ccnXduw,,Vegans steer clear. Our options are fries & sweet potato fries. I did made a dish of fries with sautéed mushrooms & onions because I was with friends who wanted to eat here. Everyone else enjoyed themselves.,
FZpldhgoPWI1eRaRG_Kgog,,,"Ron is the man!!! He totally took care of us like family with the sincere form of southern hospitality. We started the night off with the swamp tea and a sazzy and both were ON POINT! The fried oyster you have to get and the taste of New Orleans gets you everything you possibly need on a Monday night. Red beans and rice, crawfish and jambalaya were out of the freakin' world. Best creamer brûlée in the world dude, for real."
F_Bg8r2EzSqhaHlvfPDLgA,"Medium and mild had very little flavor/heat. I got wings and a leg quarter and didnt finish it because it wasnt that crispy, little flavor and barely coated.  I can still see the unfinished pieces of chicken in my head. i dont know if it was the cooks that day or what but im still so disappointed.

Hot , i feel, is the best level there in terms of flavor and heat. 

I will say the sandwich is pretty good but even then not mind blowing. Howlin rays in california is better. Also, Prince's in Nashville is much better.",,
F_SLKO6rcypQbbZEm-yRRQ,,,"I'm not sure what was up the day Anthony C. visited this place, but my experience was astounding, and this was definitely the best restuarant and best seafood I ate while in New Orleans.

I had actually never come across a review for this spot while I was researching my eat-a-thon itinerary prior to my trip. While heading into the French Quarter one evening, I was lucky enough to be driven by a New Orleans native who highly recommended this spot and told me I absolutely had to try the crawfish cakes. Well, when in Rome...

As we walked to the door and stopped to check out the menu, an older couple stepped out with a contented sigh, saw us and remarked ""Just go in and eat. We come here every time we visit New Orleans, and this is by far our favourite spot"". As we were escourted in, we overheard another couple saying ""oh my gosh, that was the best meal I ever had"". Ok, now I'm practically drooling in anticipation.

Our server was incredibly attentive and oozed southern charm. He sat us right next to the kitchen, which is open concept and allowed us to view our food being made. I did get those crawfish cakes, and let me tell you, they melt in your mouth like butter. Not too strong on the fishy side, but not overwhelmingly spicy. Just the perfect balance of taste between the seafood and stuffing and spice. We also ordered the nightly special, the Ahi Tuna steak stuffed with crab meat, with a side of red beans and rice and jambalaya. The tuna was not overly fishy either, which I was concerned about, and had a firm texture, delicious with the light crabmeat filling. Overall, there was not a bite I took of that whole meal where I didn't make some sort of audible sound of contentment. At the end of the meal, the cook came out to take our plates and I complemented him on the food. He seemed genuinely thankful, and beemed at us as he returned to the kitchen, obviously taking pride in the food they serve.

This was definitely by far the best meal I had during my week stay pigging out on seafood, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the FQ. Not to be missed!"
F_jXKUZsJ9f9TBvDeCBCbg,"Stopped in to pick up a Togo order after leaving the airport. Fast prep time, super tasty food. Especially the sides. Greens & Mac are top notch. Banana pudding is towards the top of the list and the chicken is KILLER!",,
F_o1GSKpxfkvQorOea55tw,,,The food here is soooooo delicious! Waiter was very friendly and checked on us often. My boyfriend and I both got different types of pasta and they were both tasty and filling. He had the Cajun pasta and that was my favorite for sure!  Drinks were also very good and came out fairly quickly. When we came in there was not a line but when we left there was a long line down the street of people waiting to go in. Definitely worth the wait!
FaBKW_2UFNyvXWNuJX_hjA,,I have mixed feelings about this restaurant after our last visit. We have always add this a must do every time we go to New Orleans. The line is always long but moves quickly. The food is great but you feel very rushed because they are trying to seat as many as possible. This most recent visit the floor was wet and my husband was literally sitting with his feet in a puddle of dirty water. Moving to another table was impossible because they were packed. I order raw oysters which were great and gumbo which was ok. Too much rice and the few shrimp in it were tough. I think we will skip this restaurant next time. You can get good oysters anywhere n the city and a better experience and service. Another note to the owners. The standing water outside is disgusting and an issue for people in line.,
FaLwR_SXXEoilS4XJO2ALQ,"Love this place! The lines are usually long, but it's so worth it. Crispy chicken on the outside, tender on the inside & the flavor is out of this world. The staff is pretty friendly & always helpful. It's about an hour from my house, but I sure do dragged my husband out at least once a month to eat at Hattie B's",,
FadewNTxVINfAxou0FoAyg,,,"On my first trip to New Orleans, this was my first food experience on the recommendation of some of the staff at the hotel I was staying at. It was FANTASTIC.

My friend and I got a Hurricane each (because we had to) which was both lovely and fun. We then got the Gator Tail Bites ($10) which you can get fried or blackened. We opted to get half and half to try both and honestly both were great. We then got the Louisiana Crabmeat Cakes ($14) which were just lovely. Finally, we got Oceana's Famous Oysters ($10.50 for half dozen or $17.50 for a dozen) and they were so delicious. Honestly as I write this I'm salivating, no shame at all. 

Apart from the frankly beyond fantastic food, the server was AMAZING! I'm sad to say that I can't remember her name but oh my goodness was she great. She went above and beyond, bringing extra bread without asking (the sauce on the oysters deserves extra bread), and bringing maraschino cherries to us when she apparently saw me struggling to get mine out of my drink. 

This place, between the food and the service, is 5 out of 5 would recommend. Honestly, it's more than 5 but that's all Yelp will let me give, for shame."
FaeLmYAd_ZDJt-KTcPaTnQ,,"We ended up here on a trip to New Orleans recently. There was about a 30-45 minute wait but oh my word was it worth the wait.  I had a fried fish po' boy, my sister had the Acme Special po' boy and my fiance and brother had the charbroiled oysters. It was the best dinner we had on our trip. Will definitely be heading back when we go back to New Orleans","One day we went for lunch.. I had the crawfish eitufee, my sister had the alligator bite po' boy, my brother had the blackened fish po' boy and my fiance had the blackened redfish eitufee.  It was so yummy, we ended up there again for their breakfast menu. Will definitely be going back whenever we make another new orleans trip"
FailbdrAC2_rzVxFaAFRmQ,"Stopped here while doing a foodtrip through the South. Be prepared for a line. But it's worth the wait. I got the ""hot"" spiciness level chicken. I would equate it to medium spicy level if you were getting Thai food. Not overpoweringly hot at all, but very flavorful.",,

FbxsV42a-7VymViATg2lMQ,,If you see a line outside of the acme oyster house you should wait! Had a seat at the bar and two dozen chargrilled oysters later. OMG! Epic! The bartenders were awesome and did not let your glass go empty.,
Fc08j_zeZSKF1Omgv_ZRTg,,"This is a chain that is equivalent to Fridays but they serve Cajun junk food style. It's a tourist trap. The jambalaya is mushy and lacks taste. A margarita is 9 dollars during lunch. The red beans came out cold. The oysters are just ok, nothing special. We spent 85 dollars on lunch but we could of had an upscale meal for that price! Sooo mad!!!",
FcCXzssUi922eoAAAucMQA,"Everything that I have eaten here is amazing! I know people come here for the hot chicken (because, well duh) but the collard greens are amazing! Sometime last year they added a hot chicken sandwich to their menu, and it is also my favorite menu item. Expect long lines (unless it's like 3 ish on a weekday). It is definitely worth the wait, though. The place is kid friendly too, so that is a plus.",,
FcQR2WiwrncwdawN-DM3dg,,"BEST OYSTERS ever. We waited on a Friday night in line for about 2 hours...which was ridiculous. But then when we had the food, it was AMAZING!!! Plan on drinking in line. Also stop by during the day when it's less busy to see if there's a way to by pass the line. We saw lots of people get in right away without waiting because they had a red ACME card.
(If you don't want the crazy long wait, DRAGOS in Hilton Hotel, has amazing chargrilled oysters as well...less known to the tourists & more a local place so the wait is way less).",

A staff member at the hotel told us this place was amazing but the lines could be brutally long so as an option you could place an order online. Thank God for foodie angels!!! We placed our order online, waited about 10 minutes and was able to secure a spot in the outdoor seating area...NOTE: inside seating is for dine in guest and NOT orders places online. The meal...fresh, tasty and the perfect amount of heat. The pimento mac n cheese was good but the black eye pea salad stole the show and made it a palate pleasing gotta have again meal in this life. Hubby had wings, fries and coleslaw and was also quite pleased. Will definitely visit again.",,
Fcnw7XVR62cdvNs58TXVcw,"The chicken is good quality meat and the greens are amazing. You can order it to go to avoid the line or go to the other location on Charlotte Ave. They have a parking lot and the line is a lot shorter. They have a few beers on tap, but they are always good local brews.",,

I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys oysters!",

Fe7C6jRUU5l4_An-xsLzNw,,"Even if you don't like oysters, you must come here! Oyster aren't on my top ten, but I did enjoy Acme's grilled half-shells.  I must say, coming from the west coast, I am used to seeing enormous oysters. Gulf oysters, like the ones at Acme, are half the size. Smaller, yes, but a must try.  You must also try the fried soft-shell crab, gumbo, and corn and crab bisque. The bread pudding with whisky sauce was so delicious, we had to order two! Come in early, because it does get crowded!

Eat it. Like it. Repeat.",
FeMwMskUzAHCFBmbBOkThg,,We stopped into the Acme Oyster House for lunch today and it was fabulous. Raw oysters were plump and delicious. The chargrilled oysters were to die for...incredible. Then we had the Peacemaker Po' Boy. Heavenly. My advice is to eat at the bar and make sure to try whatever your heart desires. You won't be disappointed. Service at the bar was friendly and efficient.,

We didn't wait in the line over the weekend.  However, we walked by early afternoon and noticed there was no line and were seated right away.  We ordered the char grilled oyster as well as the raw ones.  Both were delicious but I preferred the grilled ones.  Make sure you take the bread and dip it in the gooey yumminess that's left on the plate.  We ordered the jambalaya which is good enough for two although I would've ate the whole plate by myself!  It was that good!  On our second day we ordered the same thing but added a po' boy sandwich which we also split.  I'm happy we didn't have to wait on line the days we went but I believe it's worth the wait.  Especially if you're from out of town.  The staff was very nice both times and the atmosphere is laid back.  Go for it and enjoy!!",

FeuxfqpBEmDokb8xMNBevQ,,The longest line you'll ever wait in to eat at a restaurant but it is definitely worth it. Both times I visited I got the fried oysters which just melt in your mouth. On my first visit I made the mistake of getting the fried oyster po boy because I ended up not even touching the bread the oysters were so good! The jambalaya was very good as well. On my second visit I tried the Oyster Rockefeller soup and I highly recommend it!,

I had the blackened Catfish and I was very pleased. The best catfish I have ever eaten! My friends had the chicken fettuccini Alfredo and the fried shrimp with all the normal sides.

- 1 lbs of crawfish: Really large, great flavor (sweet meat but perfect seasoning, not too salty with the perfect amount of spice), cooked with roasted garlic

I asked a friend of mine who lives in New Orleans for a nice, casual seafood place to eat, and she recommended Felix's across the street from Acme, where all the locals go.  From inside Felix, my family and I heartily enjoyed our oysters, gumbo, and seafood platter while we watched the long line across the street at Acme's, which snaked around the block.

The next day, the line at Acme's was more manageable, so we ventured in.  Our gumbo was good, but the grilled oysters were terrible.  Yes, they were bigger than the ones at Felix's, but you simply could not taste the oysters through the excess salt and garlic, and this is coming from a garlic aficionado.  We had to fight through the salt monster to get those oysters down.  A terrible meal, particularly after the one we'd had at Felix's, where the oysters were flavored with the perfect combination of salt, garlic, butter, and parsley.",

I went with The Cajun Sampler, which had jambalya, shrimp creole, and I can't remember what else, but it was outstanding! Babe had the special of the night, which was about $25 for Redfish (generous portion) with mushroom shrimp cream sauce and fried shrimp with a side, so good!!

FlywjiiARjGP1TLcFcEOAw,OMG the chicken is soooooo good.  I was so surprised that it was as good as it was.  I believe this place has changed chicken for me forever.  The food is crave-able.  I waited an hour for my chicken but it was worth the wait.  When I get back to the area this place is on the must do list.,,
FmS_qwo7hds1dHner5vjgQ,,,3.5 STARS. Good food and service. The oysters were decadently presented and prepared. The gumbo was tasty and certainly worth ordering. The coffee was great! Service was pleasant. Value for the money: Expen$$ive.
FmUxf__7F19dEGBHbCEQzA,,Amazing food and service. The oysters here made me a believer( never like oysters prior to this experience) there was a short line to get in and I see why the food is amazing I have tried the gumbo jambalaya oysters as well as red beans and rice with smoked sausage and it was fabulous I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to enjoy a relaxing easy-going experience with great food.,
FnWSNZfTgO4cJRueZSYljg,"My brother and I went to Nashville for a few days to attend the Jack White and Loretta Lynn concert. We had our first dinner at Hattie B's after seeing all the positive reviews online and we were so far from disappointed that we had our last dinner there too! We went for 'Medium' heat the first time and since that was not hot enough for us, we went for 'Hot' the second time. Both times; however, the chicken was moist, delicious, and cooked to perfection. The batter was not too thick either. Service was great despite how busy it was both times. The line moved fast, the employees were friendly, and the orders got checked before being delivered to customers. Needless to say, I would definitely be back the next time I'm in Nashville.",,
FnYln9XFzzDlh8LAIb5_6w,,,"The oysters were good, a little too cheesy for my taste. I also ordered the Mardi Gras pasta and that was creamy, really good. I added some spicy sauce and a powder they have on the table. 

Heads up, if you check in, you may get 10% off the check, but you need to print out the coupon or else it won't get granted. That was low key a bummer, keeping in mind the app gives you coupon after checking in."
FndyT0pHfFNW9E6-JY_ZLg,,"This is one of my favorite spots, in the U.S.! Obviously get the oysters (I prefer raw but chargrilled are good too). The gumbo is divine and the service is unbeatable. I like sitting at the bar and having discussion with the shuckers. The smell is very fishy but worth it. The medley is my goto meal but everything is good. Buy tshirt when you're there and make your friends jealous. Ha! Ask for Hollywood at the bar.",
FnfEXra6wyJzRUzD9ySUVg,,"This was THE best place to get the New Orleans style Oysters! When we were there, the line is pretty long, however, it goes fast, no more than a 15-20 mins wait. You can also eat at the bar, which my wife and I decided to do, so we only waited literally 7 mins in line. We ordered the 12 Charbroiled Parmesan, Garlic and Butter Oysters!! OMG! These are better than raw! That first bite in your mouth will get you instantly, with all of those flavors exuding from your palate. It's Juicy, salty, creamy, savory and hot all at the same time. Then I chased that down with an all authentic hurricane drink. Wow! I can't tell you enough how satisfied I was. 

Then I ordered a Shrimp Po'Boy with Remoulade sauce. That really was soo delicious, the french bread that they use is to die for, crunch on the outside, and melt in your mouth on the inside. Topped with tomatoes lettuce onions and fresh hot cajun shrimp!

The waiter told us most of the seafood
is fresh daily from the Gulf of Mexico, so we are literally eating the freshest seafood at this place!

This is worth the experience in the French Quarters, if you missed this place, please go slap yourself!",
Fnkp5MOZZXFg487U3mVcrg,,,First time coming here was recommended by a friend the service was good but the food was not the gumbo was bland and lack warm also the taste of New Orleans was not what I thought it would be this place is WAY over priced
FoRwzSHsbu6bjIv8YpFFYA,,"Food is really good. Service is the worst. Been going to Nola for 15 years and this is the worst. Bartender likes to argue with you about horseradish on your oysters. Just give the customer what they want, no matter what you think.",
FobommDHDHheMNwx409S4w,While visit Tennessee we decided to try out a hot chicken spot which the city/state is best known.  The chicken was so deliciously crispy and spicy! The line was out the door however we only waited about 15 minutes. Once we made it inside we learned why the line was so long. It's not your traditional restaurant where you're seated and a waiter takes your order. You order first and provided a number then a server brings out your food. Seating is limited and outdoor on a covered patio. I definitely would revisit just know to get a lower spice level. Aside from the chicken luv next favorite was the waffles.,,
FofQrv2OC4mmWwPge6OOWQ,,,This place is a must if you are visiting NOLA. Darrick the bartender always does a great job
FpfV9j0qTfNXfZtPhzfsbw,,,"This was an okay bar. The food was not great but It was not horrible. We went twice. The first time we had dinner, which was a side of fettuccine and oysters. The oysters were fine but in all of Louisiana (okay in the French quarters) they don't serve vignette with oysters. Also, these warm
oysters are very mild in flavor. The server was nice but she spent most for her time in eye view outside talking to someone in the courtyard and was not very attentive to our table. The next day we went for brunch, which was a much better experience. The shrimp and grits were delightful, and the server and service was amazing as well!"
FpovxC9QBamvpwKcovvgpQ,,"Acme lives up to the hype! I had gone to Felix's a few days before because the line at Acme was so long, but I have to say it is so worth it. The food was way better than at Felix for sure. If you make it here try the char broiled oysters - they are the best!",
Fq5CvUC1AzK8GSmpyn0UeQ,,Solid bar food.  Nice alternative to Drago's - I still think Drago's has the best oysters but saw a cockroach behind the Drago's counter (downtown location) so I tend to frequent Acme's instead.,
Fq6NbtHCstZcKAEqOMEaqg,"I love Hattie B's hot chicken. As a resident of midtown, it's one of my go-to restaurants. Sure pepper fire and prince's have amazing hot chicken, but good hot chicken is good hot chicken. I like to get the white meat plate for myself or the large white if I'm trying to order for two on the cheap. The large white, large dark, or half bird is a ton of food. You could make it last two meals, or you could feed two people on it. I like to order ""damn hot"" as my spice level. It's a good strong kick. Not for those who are afraid of spice. If you think you're a spice head, you will be fine with the damn hot. If not, order mild. The pimento Mac and cheese is lit. The banana pudding is my second favorite in Nashville. Can't really go wrong at Hattie B's. Pro tip: order online. The wait to get food can be maddening if you stand in line (1-2 hours on a busy night). Order online, and swoop in to grab your takeout. They are often 10 minutes behind the scheduled pick-up time.",,
Fq_U2Tqq91RrdNV92EPVyw,,,We had lunch here. The food was great. We had the blackened catfish. Our server Jamal was wonderful. He was very attentive and check in on us during our meal. I wish every server was like Jamal.
FqfkXQccfpe4j9jw_pozkA,,Love the oysters here! this place and drago's are my favorites,
Fql77crTCq3pbi7V2TJ9LQ,,"We waited over an hour for a table. Witnesses a women flirting with the door host and got seated before us. She was behind us in line, with the same number of guests.  The food was so mediocre. We were all so confused by the long line.  The crab cake wasn't made with high quality lump crab meat.  The fried oysters were tiny and overlooked. The chargrilled oysters were the best thing we had. The soft shell crab was so salty!!! The bread used in their po boys were so hard that my niece was covered in bread crumbs whilst she ate it. The server charged us with a coleslaw we didn't order and upgraded us for a side without advising us. He also didn't give us the friend crab claws we ordered.",
FqnS_jxyzV2KeHU8uX4SJw,My fav hot chicken and I live down the street from the one in West on Charlotte. Using their website to order is AMAZING!,,
Fqu8vSEI8O32jHGbIxw1pg,"Amazing!  As a Tennessean I felt it was my obligation to finally try hot chicken on my trip to Nashville this weekend.  What a great lunch and great experience.  The chicken was just perfect, and the Hot version that I got was just hot enough to be considered ""spicy"" to me.  Next time I'll get Damn Hot, but I love spicy food.

As for the portion, I got a large white plate (two breasts and two wings) and was full as a tick when I left with some still on the plate.  The collard greens were perfect, as were the grits and mac & cheese.  I've eaten a lot of black-eyed peas in my days, but nothing like these.  I'm used to them being sort of like refried beans in texture, but these were firm and mixed with chilies and other ingredients I've never seen paired together.  I've eaten enough banana pudding in my life to fill a swimming pool, but this was seriously up there with ""mamaw's"" that we compare everything to here in the South.  It is an absolute must, and if your chicken is too spicy the banana pudding will help calm down the fire.

There really isn't anything I can say negative about the food, and the only negative about the building really had more to do with it being PACKED inside.  Good food brings in a lot of folks, and when they're packed in it makes it difficult to get around.  The bathroom doors are also through the line of packed in people, so they can be tough to get in to.

I'm already wanting to try different places for hot chicken, but man they've got their work cut out for them against Hattie B's!",,
FrG2l8okslrVOawb2WV3_g,,,"The food is wonderful. My boyfriend and I can be picky eaters, but this place did not disappoint. I had a shrimp po boy and he had the blackened chicken Alfredo. Both were great. We were seated fairly quickly without a reservation. The environment was completely different from the craziness of Bourbon street."
FrUQJbiiH4QtaxtY9oCQsg,,,"My wife and I chose the Oceana Grill due to the close proximity to our hotel and after reading the favorable reviews on Yelp. The atmosphere is very casual. We were seated immediately upon arrival and were taken to the second floor which was a bit quieter than the first. We ordered the Oceana Famous Oysters for the appetizer and they were delicious! I ordered the daily special, which was chargrilled catfish on a bed of jambalaya with fried crawfish tails. It was one of the best seafood dishes I've ever eaten! Not a crumb was left! And for dessert, we split the Bananas Foster Ice Cream Cake. That was the perfect end to the meal and I highly recommend it! Our waitress was very prompt and cordial. We sat beside a large group of very loud and obnoxious drunk people who kept cursing out loud. She kept apologizing and was very sympathetic. Other than the loud group, our visit was great and we had no complaints about the food. I will definitely recommend you visit!"
FrXqoFcQqh0UYCvHQTfu-w,,,"I hadn't been to New Orleans before, and even though my girlfriend had, it had been many years. So even with Yelp at our fingertips, we were at a loss of where to go for dinner our first night in town. The concierge at our hotel suggested Oceana, and said his wife worked there. We were a little skeptical, but decided to take a chance. I'm SO glad we did.

We had the BBQ shrimp appetizer, which was 6 enormous shrimp in a very spicy sauce. They were great! For the main course, I had fried catfish filets, which were fresh and crispy and perfect. She had the red beans and rice, which was also delicious. The portions were huge. Neither of us could finish our dishes. The drinks were also nice and strong, and the waiter was friendly, even if the service was a little slow.

If I was a local, I'd probably frequent this restaurant."
Fryx66otqOrU-qeb6ST6Xg,,Chargrilled Oysters and the ACME Special Po Boy are must haves!,
FsJ2Rtic7huDbcgfOGPEkQ,,,"Great service from Bridget T. The food was delicious, my wife and I ate there 2 days in a row. We will definitely be back. Everyone was so friendly and Bridget remembered us from our first visit. I highly recommend Oceana Grill for breakfast lunch and dinner."
FshbZoZm7HDEuzPA2-bkKw,,This is always one of my go to places when in New Orleans or Destin Florida the food is always consistently good.  The charbroiled oysters are a must and the onion rings are delicious. Don't leave with out trying the bread pudding it is delicious.,
FsvZpP9m3RG95EvjDE5JWQ,,,"Landed in NOLA really late and was looking for a place walking distance from my hotel that would be open at midnight. This popped up on my search and being a pescatarian, I was ecstatic. It surprisingly wasn't crowded and I got seated relatively quickly. The service was incredible and my server was such a sweetheart. Checked in often and was really warm and welcoming (got that southern hospitality immediately upon arrival to Louisiana). I ordered the shrimp platter and it came out really fast. The portion is VERY generous and I got through 3/4 of it. I was a little underwhelmed by the flavor because it basically tasted like frozen shrimp and fries I get at the local market and defrost. It wasn't bad (minus the tartar sauce which did taste funny/old) but it wasn't something phenomenal. The hush puppies were actually pretty good--had a kick to them. All in all, a decent spot to visit for a quick bite. My tour guide recommended it to our group a few days later and suggested the blackened rockfish and had I stayed longer I would've gone back and tried it because it was a nice spot. Definitely recommend and would visit again on my next trip."
FtDzYF4EDtE-tC3EONsR4w,,"We stop at acme every time we are in the Nola area and they never disappoint! We've also been to the one in Metairie and gulf shores,AL, and this one is the place to go! Not a huge fan of oysters but absolutely love the charbroiled ones! I almost always order the ""boo fries"" as my entree and I am always satisfied! My boyfriend gets the the red beans and rice and almost licks the plate clean everytime! I guess my only complaint is they don't sell coke products lol. 

Beware though, always a huge HUGE wait line. So if you're in a hurry I would choose somewhere else!",
FtGy7Uld8A7TOlpbnpH5-A,,,They know how to satisfy a shellfish craving. Portions are huge. Good for trying to get your fill of the regional food.
FtUDjNLhVjlIoeFKm-DYnQ,,"So on the recommendation of a buddy I braved the line for dinner at the famous Acme Oyster House. Flying solo it was about a 20 min wait, so not too bad. 

The staff - Superb! Friendly, engaging, good ol' Southern hospitality. 

Drink(s) - I went with the NOLA classic, albeit not from the landmark establishment, but in the Big Easy, gotta have a Hurricane. It was very good, while I'm not an expert in rating Hurricanes, I'd venture a guess that it compares well to other places. Easily an CAT 4. 

Appetizer - I , for whatever reason, am not a fan of cooked oysters, so obviously I went with raw. (6-$8.99) They were outstanding, the cocktail sauce was perfect. Little heat, but didn't distract from the flavor. Excellent. 

Main course - soft shelled crab ""Po' boy"" ($16.99) allegedly an Acme ""must have"" (at least from reading the reviews here on Yelp!)  i added a little tartar sauce & cocktail sauce to mine. Good choice, tartar sauce was very flavorful, not typical ""mayo"" with some pickles. 

OK- Wow! F$&King delicious! I see why there's so many stars. 

Say hello to my man Curtis (easy to recognize, hasn't cut his hair since 1999) one of New Orleans finest bartenders. 

Enjoy. I'll be back.",
FtsJnziBa99oxAEun-be2Q,,,Jamal was amazing he made sure that all our needs were met being that we are newbies to new Orleans. The food at Oceana was delicious I wasn't let down. Must go
Fu5iFo0NLnzM43SQr70Q1w,,,"The food was great, the service was very friendly and the atmosphere was very enjoyable.  When we left, the line to get in was down the block, so make a reservation or go early - it is worth it."
FuQ0L_uNqfZqySYbvpOOSA,,"Acme has wonderful oysters, some of the best in the city. The wait can be a little bit long but I think it is definitely worth it if it is under an hour. Depends on the time of the day for loudness and craziness but for being right in the French Quarter it isn't that bad.",
FuUQPUWTM0ZVSdgxIXP--Q,,,The food was DELICIOUS & our server DeMarcus was perfect! I will definitely come back at OCEANA
FuYBF96BC81dz7DyvabeNA,Delicious. Got the small dark hot and added on a damn hot chicken tender to try out that level of heat - it was damn hot. Cole slaw and fries for the sides. If you don't like caraway seeds stay away from the Cole slaw. The line was out the door and about halfway down the length of the outdoor seating area when we arrived at 11:30 AM on a Tuesday. Took about 30 minutes to get through but then only 5-10 minutes to get our food once we ordered. The staff was incredibly friendly.,,
Fucp3TGr-XJM4FYzWDygSg,"Hmmm...we joked, while standing in the blazing sun for around 20 minutes, that the ""real"" hot chickens were us! This is a local institution and those ""in the know"" know enough to not stand in line (for heaven's sake!) but order in advance and walk right in to pick up your order to go. Tourists that we were, we were suckered into standing in line, highly anticipating the ""Hattie's  experience."" I have to say it IS quite the experience. We ordered chicken fingers (medium heat) and a quarter chicken - white meat - also medium heat. The sides we selected were the red potato salad, cole slaw, and greens. My chicken was so over-cooked and dry it was inedible. But Robin's chicken strips were delicious! I thought the potato salad was bland, but maybe you need a little bland after all of that spicy chicken! All in all, though, we just weren't that impressed with the food. The spice rub for the medium was just right - not too hot and not too bland - any milder and it would not be hot chicken and any hotter and your lips will burn. Seating is hard to come by and it's community style here - if you sit at a table and there is room for others, move your but over and let others sit down and eat! 
The staff here, though, are incredible. Very friendly and have a good time at work! I just love that. I can't even imagine how bloody hot it is back there for all of them cookin' and servin' up that hot chicken. But they handle it all with grace. The gal taking our order was so kind to give us a few tastes of drafts she had - which I really appreciated and her demeanor seemed to suggest, ""hey, I'm happy to help you and those behind you can kindly wait their turn!""",,
FuuzUjXgln5ELt5on_umaA,,Great place for a beer and some pretty good fried fish.   Chargrilled Oysters were fantastic.,
FvM-oj5dHTLOnPuigFnBJw,"After waiting in line for 40 minutes, I got privilege to test Hattie B's super spicy 'Shut the cluck up!' wings. It was undoubtedly the spiciest wings I tested in united states.. yet it was extremely appetizing! Reminded me 'spicy Kolhapuri Chicken' from my home country.",,
FvNCixS7qDs6nVIzBwHiaw,"Food was amazing along with the side dishes as well. The staff was friendly, this is the place if you like hot fried chicken. They have a range from no spice to very hot. No spice would be the (Southern), I went in the middle with the heat and ordered the medium this was hot enough, one more level and I probably wouldn't have been able to enjoy it. My two sides were Mac n Cheese and Greens good stuff. Next time I'm in Nashville I'll be back. Thanks for the great food and a friendly staff.

Yours truly, 
The happy customer",,
FvPs61-JgD4kFDXJJfGq8w,"Some of the best food I've had in years. Went for lunch on a weekday. There was a line but not a bad wait. Ordered my chicken Hot, and it was!  It was incredible. Just the right amount of heat but I can't imagine it spicer -- there were three hotter options.  Great sides to add.  Don't miss it.",,
FvcRBw1tCDEh880AVoPqdQ,,Yep you have to stand in line. It was totally worth it. We started with the grilled oysters and they were worth it. I had the sample plate and my hubby had the catfish. Great gumbo and delicious red beans and rice. The hush puppies were awesome. We also enjoyed sitting at the bar watching the employees shuck the oysters. I was impressed. The guy even did one behind his back. Great experience.,
Fvht4n17iZ2Xp-vxlXnKvg,AMAZING FOOD. like so good. like worth the wait so good. But 4 stars because of the two hour wait. Also when you have that nashville 107 degree day and stand in line outside for 2 hours dont expect it to be very cool in there- because its not - the food is just amazing. I saw others call orders in and pick up- thats what I would do next time!,,

Ryan, our server was just as amazing, he came back 2 times to take our order since we wanted to take pictures and was so patient with us. AND THE FOOD!!! Oh my gosh, how ever long the wait is, ITS WORTH IT!!! The chicken Alfredo was the best I have ever had in my life. The margs were so strong and good (get the double) . I would love to come back here and see these amazing smiling servers and hostess again. Such a good place to eat."
FwfHZ8V4YrZ6m-om1iXHPA,Food was good. Parking can be difficult. Domestic pitcher was good. Kid friendly. Banana pudding is a must.,,
Fx-mhuS4_-0rgMwKuFaWOA,"We ordered 2 tenders plates with pimento mac & cheese, coleslaw, and french fries, Southern greens and red skin potato salad. There was a massive error on their online ordering system which caused an over hour wait for the food to even be prepared. Then, we sat in the ""curbside pickup"" parking spot for another 30 minutes, asking two staff members for assistance before they finally recognized the error... so they gave us a free banana pudding for dessert for our wait. 

The chicken was good!! It completely held up to the expectation of it being the best. The sides were just okay, but the main reason you're there is for the chicken. Focus on that! 

I would eat there again- in person, not ordering online.",,
FxQraQXyzKbB-MESgR5fRQ,,"Came here early to avoid the long wait (got in line around 5:30 and ended up sitting at the bar). The bartender was really great, wonderful attitude and very attentive, considering how much he had going on behind the bar. 

Food: I had a cup of gumbo and the small crab cakes with sweet potato fries and hush puppies. The crab cakes were only ok, fried a little too long and the crab was not lump crab and had a lot of filler (was a little pasty). The hush puppies were also mostly breading, and not too impressive. The gumbo was pretty good, though.  The best thing on the plate were the sweet potato fries. My husband and I both felt they were the best we've ever tried! 

Husband was very happy with his Moscow Mule, oyster shot, and the fried fish pro-boy. He felt the bread to fish was a really nice ratio, and enjoyed the crispy fish. 

Overall, for the price and the ambiance, a good meal to end our trip on. 

3.5 stars, rounding up for good service.",
FxVf81q3rfzzsiwXf3y2bg,,,"I'm sure the locals would disagree with me, but I think this is definitely one of the spots you have to go to when in New Orleans. I actually ended up coming here after getting a recommendation from one of my friends who works in the area. I didn't want to deal with the line or craziness of Bourbon St, but I was suprised when I walked straight in and was seated in less than 10 minutes (I'm sure this is atypical, but I had to mention it because it's why it got 5 stars from me).  

The waiters were very attentive and courteous and the food was AMAZING. I just wish I stopped by earlier during my vacation so I could've tried more on the menu."
Fxxq88bC6cQSPZVF2K2KuQ,,,Great food. The oysters were amazing. Stopped in for breakfast also. Paw Paws corn beef hash and bloody Mary have amazing flavors. Our server Whitney was very good.
Fy-erFCUF3UZFNVu84wVXQ,My first time eating Nashville hot chicken in Nashville. Hattie B's and one other restaurant are credited with being the inspiration for this trend. Be prepared to wait in line regardless of the location. We waited 30 minutes to get inside and another 10 to place our order at the counter. I wimped and got a heat level two down from the hottest and it was still plenty hot for me. Very good fried chicken. Good texture and temp. Not greasy. Definitely recommend you do like the Nashvillians do when in Nashville.,,
FyEnOyPZurp-fhYG2ESxxQ,,,"Food was great but overpriced, service was terrible. We ordered the Bloody Mary pictured on the host stand and didn't receive it till after we got the food. Was super cool but price wasn't listed and came on the bill as $30. We got the seafood platter and it was great. Never been to a place that serves fried fish and fries but no malt vinegar. Server was no where to be found the entire time. Asked for lemon for the fish and didn't get until food was cold. Maybe would try again because of food quality."

Place is a bit off of bourbon. Came here around 1030pm so it wasn't that packed. Still had to wait and make sure our whole party was present before getting seated.

The oysters were quite delish. I don't know if I can eat a whole dozen since it's quite buttery and oily. But the 2 pcs I ate were very good. 

Also tried the jambalaya and the gumbo. It was pretty good. But a bit overpriced since the the dishes were really small. 

Service was pretty good. They seem to have a good system running the business since it gets super crowded. Saw this place when we passed Bourbon and everyone said this place was a must try!",
FzvI3K36kqAGFvP_qUxGzg,"I was in town for business and remembered hearing about their hot chicken on Food Network, so I had to.check it out.

Some locals warned me that long lines outside the door is pretty common,  so I ordered online. When I got there, surprisingly no lines at all. Still, my carry out order was ready and off I went.

I ordered the 3-piece wing plate, and since this was my first time having hot chicken, I had the ""hot"" version but it wasnt hot enough; in hindsight I should have opted for a hotter version. I would have liked more seasoning for my taste, but overall a good experience. Next time I'm in town I gotta go for the ""damn hot"" or go all the way with 'shut the cluck up."" If I break out into a heavy sweat it'll be worth it.",,
G-SPBj0cjMwBvC0HQGWXwA,,,"Decided to try this place because there was a line outside but it was going pretty fast. We thought ""Oh hey, long line this must be good!"" When we got to the front of the line (we were a party of 9), the guy in charge of bringing customers in moved my group to the other side of the door outside. So first, he told us the wait would be 20 minutes (hence why we stayed in line), then he told us it'd be 10 minutes when he moved us out of the line. Then we ended up waiting an hour outside. About 20 people went into the restaurant that were in line after us but they were smaller parties so we didn't think anything of it. While we were waiting for an hour, a party of 11 and another party of 8 who came in line after us were seated before my party. We were extremely upset. One of the girls in our party had to go into the restaurant and talk to the manager. Thank goodness he was rational and seated us right away upstairs. When we got upstairs, I didn't understand why there were so many tables open but they couldn't seat us. Maybe they were understaffed? 

Our server was very nice and entertaining so that was nice. The manager also came to check up on us a few times to make sure we were doing fine. Food came out fast too.

I ordered the oysters and shrimp and crab gumbo. The oysters were good so I was very happy. The gumbo was also delicious. My date tried the alligator sausage and he still dreamt about it days later. 

TL;DR: Would go again if I had a smaller party next time. Wait too long and seating was not fair. Server and food was good tho."

G-wDAIX0mZb2m9oxoEQWgA,,"Waited in line for 45 min, but it was worth it. Here's a tip, grab a drink while ur waiting in line. It helps pass time.

We had the charbroiled oysters, was seasoned & cooked just right. Didn't know Seafood etouffee could taste so good. Red beans and rice & gumbo was da bomb. Get the New Orleans medley, u will not be disappointed",
G03thUgkvfOm7btufx2TzQ,,,"I'll preface this by saying maybe my expectations were unrealistic. It's my first time in New Orleans, and I assumed I would have the greatest seafood known to man.

Our experience was decent, but not quite what I was expecting, hence the three stars.

We ordered the Oceana oyster appetizer, which had an excellent sauce. Our entres were fine, but the sides were better. I love good sides, but I didn't want it to overshadow the seafood. Our service was OK. The price was OK. I think that just kind of describes the experience.

(There was a long line out front, but it moved very quickly.)"
G09WjUzpPC4tW6XmFbRAPg,,"Good food, LONG waits at times, too many tourists! There are a ton of places with fresh raw oysters without the wait. The food is good though, all of it. My recommendation, try the French Market Bar on Decatur for Oysters, as well as the rest of their food.",
G0C2l47qtwUmV_WhsyQ1sQ,,,"I wanted multiple dishes so I ordered the taste of New Orleans which came with Creole Jambalaya, etouffee,  and red beans and rice to share among a few other dishes. 
Man were these delicious! I don't know if this is the standard for creole in the area, but it was delicious! I enjoyed all the food we ordered. Definitely get the taste of New Orleans if you are new to creole food and want to sample a mix or if you can't decide which one you want. You can't go wrong either way. Definitely better than other places I've had creole outside of the city. Nom nom nom! Worth the wait! They are busy and definitely make use of the multiple floors. If you're in the area this is a must visit!"
G0VSSjzJWZHNwzgm_Mt68Q,Worth the hype and wait -- perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken with standard sides. I recommend the 3 chicken tenders at varying spice levels,,
G0_2A0QeYfTS-V1SKJzKWw,,"Don't let the long line that leads around the corner deter you, its worth the wait time and time again.  I can eat raw oysters for days but after I tried them Chargrilled, I found a new love.

Here's a tip, go by yourself or with only 1 other person and you will get in faster than the larger parties.",
G1AqJ9XVtLZUBZf3SblCRA,One of the best places to get Nashville hot chicken. If you're unsure I'd recommend the 3 piece tenders plate with Mac and Cheese or potato salad. You can choose your level of heat on the chicken. Start out at medium if unsure.,,
G1IOTBRRJjUsuwtkPS1hnw,,Just ok.  We had the grilled oysters and boom boom shrimp.   The grilled oyster were just ok. The flavors were not deep.  We had the oysters at Oceana the night before and they were alot better than the ones at Acme.  The boom boom shrimp were worse than what you get at Bonefish!  For all the reviews with high ratings we are disappointed.  In a city of great food it is just average nothing more.,The oysters are the best in New Orleans.   Way better than Acme.   Great deep flavors.  If you like sauces this is the place.
G1WtcPD-okGJ5ZW5NLxm3g,"If you're crunched for time, order online and pickup. You can bypass the line and still choose to eat on the outside patio. 

ALWAYS Fried chicken over Tenders

FOOD
As someone who likes spicy food, and where spicy is a default when cooking or choosing what to eat, I second guessed myself after watching Ugly Delicious (thanks, David Chang -.-).  I was scared that I couldn't handle the heat, hearing that a fellow Korean-American professed that it was ""one of the most painful experiences I've ever had in my life"" when he first tried the spiciest level of hot chicken. 

BUT after reading the helpful Yelp reviews I mustered my courage and got the Hot. Good choice! 

What we ordered:
$8.50 Small dark hot chicken plate with black eyed pea salad and pimento Mac & cheese 

I would get this again and might venture to try Damn Hot. Hubby really liked the creamy saucey Mac & cheese. I liked the contrast of the light black eyed pea salad - slightly vinegary and cut thru the grease. Order extra bread!

$4 for 2 Medium chicken tenders for the hubby - good but would order Hot next time

$9 MIL ordered Southern Tenders with fries and cole slaw - if you can't handle spice. Fries were great! 

The standouts: 
- Hot dark fried chicken
- Fries
- my Arnold Palmer: half lemonade half sweet tea

G1u5Aq9w1fPqNk7i6_7j5Q,Wow that is some good chicken. The outside is crunchy but doesn't crumble and the inside is juicy. You can order the amount of heat you prefer but the man taking the order was a little too dramatic. I got medium and it wasn't even jalapeño hot. I should have gotten hot. Sides were good too. Service was fast. We waited in line for maybe 15 minutes. Definitely will go back.,,
G1ypeMyAazHG-R2cyEYwTA,Good Stuff.  Had the Chicken Strips and Potatoes special from the Truck at Ascend Ampitheater.  Great fried chicken and a bargain for 10 bucks with the potatoes (considering the ampitheater food prices and offerings)  I got Medium and it was hot enough to feel the heat and still enjoy eating it.,,
G29mY3wUnKqCEESpkgrFOw,,,"My favorite dinner in NOLA. From the top-notch service to the quality and value of the food, this spot is the real deal. Their famous crab cake appetizer was substantial and tasty and the red fish specialty was so delicious that I had to keep stopping to marvel at the balance of flavors.  Move Oceana to the top of your culinary ""to do"" list!"

Seafood Gumbo, i requested this soup with the rice on the side mainly because i wanted to enjoy the soup not the rice, and it was great!!lots of shrimp, thick base, lot of flavor. Request for the BOWL is not that big.
Oyster Rockefeller Soup, this was the soup of the day, it was a creamy base topped with deep fried oysters, it was Deli-sh!!
*** If you are eating at the Bar and  order soups the crackers are located behind the condiments (hot sauce rack) i found them after i was finish with my soup.
Raw Oysters with horseradish tomato sauce, big-big fresh, nice clean taste.
Grilled Oysters, great smoky flavor, cheesy, accompanied by warm bread, Winner!!
We also got sodas and the bartender kept them full all the time, we got great and quick service, for our first time here and after walking all day it was perfect.

By the time we walke3ed out the door, the line was all the way to the corner..... i guess we got lucky.
New Orleans...... we will come back!!!",

Also tried their fried soft shell crab, I'd go back for all of the above, but probably for lunch when there usually isn't a line.",
G3IwQWIj5yiegtwcyc-QNw,,"Decent food but small portions.  Not impressed at all; extremely overrated.  I ordered the the fried fish, oysters, and shrimp combo-meh, nothing special.  My hubby ordered the combo jambalaya, red beans and rice, and seafood gumbo-very small portion!  He was still hungry after the meal.  Oysters were fresh and good though.",
G3OwN6QIrP10OtJmNclYow,,"We lined up like everybody else , and it was worth the wait. 
We sat at the bar where the boys were shucking oysters and were recommended the Seafood Ettouffe  and the red beans and rice. Both were substantial for the small sizes and a great cheap eat for dinner. We followed those with the bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and whiskey sauce. Need I say more, that dessert was worth the wait on its own!
Definitely recommend but get there by 6.30/7 as the wait gets worse as the night goes on",
G3ad4JNQxsLKbL4toiNLxg,"Love, love, love Hattie B.'s. I stop by every time I'm in Nashville (at least once) because it is just that good. My favorite meal is the chicken strips. You can have them pan fried or coated and fried. Both are good...although the coating that they use is divine. My favorite sides are the potato salad (sour cream-based instead of mayo-based), collard greens, and mac n cheese. I was a little confused about the mac n cheese because they use pimentos. A lot of places in Nashville use pimentos, but being from New Mexico, I've never really had dishes with pimentos. It gives it a yummy, distinct flavor. It's creamy, cheesy, deliciousness...which is what mac n cheese should be. 
They also have a great on-tap beer selection. The service is fast, efficient, and friendly. But expect a line. The line will usually go relatively quickly, but it's very common at Hattie B.'s. My next goal is to try the shrimp and grits, which is only served on Sundays. They also have Chicken and Waffles on Sundays! Eat up!!",,
G4RohdztGKxxUNiY8Pw0AQ,Delicious!!! All I can say!! Amazing chicken and sides. Was told to come here by many locals and was not disappointed . We def need one in Saint Louis!!! Wink wink,,

I usually have the small light - medium (it's not too spicy for me but the hot is so I have to go lower).   I pair it with greens and pimento Mac and cheese.  

I love to finish the meal off with the banana pudding!",,

We were planning to have oysters, and then a po'boy. We ordered 1/2 dozen raw & 1/2 dozen grilled, as well as a cpl of beers.  Teh raw oysters are served with horseradish, and a great house-made sauce. The grilled oysters are done in garlic butter and parmesan cheese, and served with crusty bread. The oysters were SO darned good (esp the grilled ones!), we ordered another 1/2 of each! Once done these, we were too full for anything else.
We had desserts though, and there were also amazing. Bananas Foster cheesecake, and the Pecan Cobbler w/ Vanilla Ice Cream. O..M..G!

We felt so welcomed!!! Thank you so much team for taking such great care of us!!!  -The Squad",
G7P7HHkhJOHOc4Cz4EYnSQ,,"AMAZING FOOD. This was my last dinner in NOLA during my trip and it was a well awaited and well worth it meal. The wait wasn't that long even though it was a week night in the evening, my party was large and we had no reservation but we were seated fairly quickly. 

The pricing is typical dinner prices but is a little bit more on the pricy side for seafood in NOLA. We ordered the chargrilled oysters and the fried soft shell crab with hush puppies, as well as a bowl of the soup of the day. The food was delicious and came out pretty fast (even with my large party). My favorite dishes were definitely the chargrilled oysters and the fried soft shelled crab! I recommend ordering the dozen char grilled oysters if you are sharing because half a dozen is just enough for one person. I also recommend sharing and ordering multiple plates because the menu is diverse and everything is well cooked. 

Overall, ambiance was wonderful and food was just as good. If I ever go back to NOLA, I will be coming back for the oysters and crab!",

G7l_KK1OjJMAGWlNFcWQVQ,,"There is always a long line of people waiting for this place, and I tell you: this place is worth it.  

The oysters here are big, sweet, and juicy. The raw plate was amazing, especially enjoyed with the cocktail sauce (just the right amount of kick!). The char-grilled plate felt a little too cheesy for my taste, but otherwise melted away in my mouth. The bang for the back is hard to beat. Yes, as someone coming from SF, I've had more ""delicate"" oysters with different flavor profiles before. But the number of meaty meaty oysters you will get from this place for under $10 is unimaginable! 

I also tried a cup of gumbo (hearty and with a generous amount of seafood) and fried fish & chips (the batter was so good, and the cook on the fish was perfect!) were also great. Did I mention -- so much food for $15!

There was also a really cute moment where one of the oyster bartenders (for the lack of better descriptions) found a small pearl inside an oyster and gave it to me! I'll always remember this place fondly.",
G8UL6NO3kqnlhweKvoV3Dw,,,"We had a good spread of sea gold choices in Oceana. Close to Bourbon street and set up in the old restaurant setting..friendly staff and good service. 

They have good veggies options. We had the NoLA Hurricane and it was sizzling with dry ice...served well..

Their oyster choices were excellent and we loved their char broiled oysters. The seafood platter choices were good.

Never had Alligator meat before and it was a good experience with their Alligator tail bites...

Veggie options were there but lower expectations on crepes and pasta! 

Don't forget to try their bread pudding...it was out of the world! 

Will recommend for a good experience!"

They have ranch, honey mustard and comeback sauce which is you know thousand island based. The pimento Mac and cheese is delicious. The greens wasn't  bad and the potatoes salad was tasty. Also the banana pudding was pretty good. 

The staff is very nice  and makes sure that your food is right before you leave.When I'm in the Nashville area I will definitely try this place again and you should too!",,"I got the seafood platter to go, it was very good, seasoned well. My favorite was the fish, cooked to perfection . I gave four stars because the fries were meh. Other than that I enjoyed the food, service was good.

I love the city of New Orleans with all of my heart and Acme is truly a gem I will stay loyal to in this wonderful city of magic and dreams.

They had a frozen version of an Incredible Hulk (Hypnotiq and Hennessy) which was tasty. 

Now, the star of the show was the RIDICULOUSLY awesome ultimate Bloody Mary! It had fried soft shell crab, oysters, shrimp, pickled green beans, and cocktail onions in the shape of a crab!!!! It was enough for a meal!! Get it. You won't be disappointed!"

There was a line both times I happened to check this place out (around 11:30am and around 6pm). We ordered 'to-go' to avoid that line.
I ordered the 3 tenders with 2 sides plate. YUMMM!!!
I got the Medium sauce and boy my mouth was on fire!! I usually order medium-hot on my chicken wings at other places, and I would definitely say this place does not mess around with their hot sauces. 
The coleslaw and pimento mac & cheese were both delicious!! 
I can see why there are so many positive reviews -- this place deserves it.

Came here for dinner after a work conference and Oceana was the only restaurant that didn't have a wait time at 7:30 on a Monday. The restaurant has three levels, and looked fairly dirty and dark. 

Onto the food and service -

Service - with a smile, but the waitress messed up on our order twice, and brought us out the wrong drink order twice as well. They delivered our food to the table next to us, even though they were eating their desserts. 

Food - Luke warm and bland. We ordered the jambalaya, blackened fish, and their special, but none of us were impressed, and all of the food came out cold. The waitress warned me that my jambalaya would be spicy, but when I tasted it, it literally tasted like tomato sauce with vegetables...poor. 

The one unique thing about them was that they had 3 dishes catered to just vegetarians, which is rare in NOLA, and even rarer in the French Quarter.

I wouldn't come back again, and I suggest that you don't either."

They serve beer too so this place has to get the Ludacris seal of approval.  Green beans and pimento mac & cheese were my sides, green beans were ok but the mac was very good.

The only off putting experience I had was a ""homeless"" guy came in the restaurant and asked me for money while I was in the middle of my meal.

GCkJx-wUtopsqiWAgII0vA,,,"The husband and I ate here for lunch prior to leaving NOLA. We saw the reviews on Urban Spoon and Yelp prior to going and decided to give it a chance. The husband ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell and the Oceana Famous Oysters. He wanted half just chargrilled without the cream sauce and the other half regular. He said he overheard the waiter arguing about his order with another member of the staff when he was leaving the restroom...

The oysters on the half shell were just ok; they definitely weren't as good as the ones we got from Felix Saturday evening. The oysters from Oceana were dry and somewhat tough. The Cajun Bloody Mary was pretty awesome. I ordered the Redfish Oceana as my entree, but requested to have it blackened with the etoufee sauce and the original sides (roasted potatoes and veggies; the blackened option comes with jambalaya, but it has pork in it, which we don't eat). We were quoted an additional $5 for the crawfish, which I was fine with. The husband ordered the crawfish etoufee entree. Had I known that I was only going to get one crawfish with my etoufee on my redfish, I would have just used some of the husband's. The crawfish etoufee itself was good; however, there was not enough etoufee on my fish to justify the $5 charge. Also, the veggies are bland and lacking in flavor. 

The bill came and there was an additional $7 to our bill; the waiter couldn't determine where it came from or why it was there (we understood the $5, but didn't know where the additional $2 went), so the manager ended up taking it off altogether.  Also, we realized that their menu is precisely the same as a restaurant on Bourbon (I can't remember the name, but it appears that they're owned by the same parent company, the menu prices are just slightly different)."

GDvqhDJuREZtFN6fjt6TSg,,"Visited the Acme on Vets. The experience was excellent from greeter to server to the foods. Of course I did the raw oysters as a starter and then the Pontchartrain Platter. Being a hedonist, I also added the Boo Fries. Even took a second order of the Boos home. 

Loved every bite. Server was genuine and quick with her service. The atmosphere is casual and has a pleasant level of noise.",
GEMjvfeQMMHLMtHcHOV5FQ,,,Food flavor excellent. The service was poor.  It took over an hour to get our food. The hostes was not very friendly either directing us to her choice of table instead of what we had asked for. We had breakfast and the crepes that were recommended by our waitress were large enough for two. She could have mentioned this when we ordered. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.
GEcOZyLgl5jkMNiIvYvIQQ,,"Must try the charbroiled oysters! Ask for extra bread to dip in the butter sauce on the oysters! Parties of 4 or less will have to wait, we waited 30 mins when the long wasn't super long, but if you have a huge group, you get seated a lot quicker!",

There aren't enough words in the English dictionary to describe how good the food was. Just amazing. I had the crab cake pasta.  My husband had the blackened catfish and jambalaya with a side of fettucine alfredo. All delicious. Might go back tonight. Outstanding 5-stars for sure"
GF2du8ees6YH076H4N6z4A,,,Service was a little slow but it was late in New Orleans a little pricey and all we had were oysters and fries.
GFfh8OAoz1EXeNsTwd9MAw,,,"Went to the N.O. a few weeks ago, and ate dinner at the place. We ate at the bar, because this place was quite popular...I now know why. We started with the crab cakes for appetizers. Probably the best I've had. Then we had some ""smoking"" hurricanes from a great bartender named Josh. The dinner was excellent; blackened catfish and mine had crawfish on top. I can't say anything bad about this place, and I'd recommend highly."

A Louisiana blacked redfish filet atop crawfish cornbread. Topped with creamy shrimp pontchartrain sauce, served with  side of mustard greens! 

I highly recommend this dish! Do yourself a favor and give a try!"
GFx0xpxi9FqsKjDXyY3J4w,"Great fried chicken. Stopped here passing through Nashville on a road trip to FL for spring break.  Definitely worth the stop, call ahead and order to beat the lines since you get to walk right up to the counter and pickup your food.  Medium was plenty spicy but I tried the hot too and there were bites that were making me sweat and tear up.",,
GG47-TJrUyKUt5oybHQlBQ,,,"Very underwhelmed. I had the red fish and étouffée with jambalaya rice and sautéed vegetables. My fish was dry and the jambalaya had a sweet tomato sauce on top. My sautéed vegetables was corn. I was expecting a vegetable medley of broccoli, zucchini or squash, maybe even green beans but not corn. I also ordered an Oceana-tini to drink it was a total waste of $10. It was super sweet and I couldn't taste any alcohol in it. For it to be a play on an apple-tini they definitely need to rethink the recipe. This place left nothing to my imagination and didn't give me a reason to return. I don't think the food is worth the asking price. Our waitress was nice and friendly which is why I gave a two star rating."
GG4pc5VlrwGSkkYXqU-SRA,Best chicken tenders I've had by far. Sides: Greens were excellent - good southern taste; Mac and Cheese was good; didn't really care for the potato salad - to me it seemed a little bland. Had the banana pudding for dessert - OMG so rich but sooooo good! I'm glad I yelped the area while in town and checked this place out!,,
GGE8PM9lRhSOXdCsrn8Aaw,,,"Everything about this place was simply OK, making it a 3 star rating for my taste. 

My husband and I were visiting New Orleans for the first time and relied on Yelp to provide us food rec's. Oceana was listed as the #1 spot to check out. We should've listened to our Uber driver on the way there (the locals always know the best spots anyways), when he said it's not his favorite. Why did we think it was just OK?

=Food didn't taste spectacular, stuff that you could buy at any state fair
=The food is EXTREMELY overpriced for what you get, you are paying for the name of the restaurant, not the quality of food
=The place felt kinda dirty (don't get me started on the bathroom)
=Loud, really close to the bustle of bourbon st.

We had excellent service though. Our waitress was friendly, prompt and even provided a recommendation for a local beignet place. Overall, this place was disappointing for the hype it has. I would suggest going elsewhere for some authentic New Orleans meals."
GGKXpOHFJ_5PiuzUbmlPxA,,"Just ate here and video taped a mouse next to our table.  Showed the manager who said ""we're the cleanest restaurant in the French Quarter.  There's construction next to us so they come out about once a week.""  He took our drinks off our bill.  The drinks?  Why not the food?  Mice don't care about the four draft beers we drank.  Thanks for the $14 off and the unknown disease I may have now.  And the food was way below expectation based on the fame of this tourist trap.",

GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w,"Hattie B's is another hot chicken joint in the Nashville area.  They offer plates (white, dark, 1/2 the bird, tenders, and wings), sides, desserts, and beer.  We ordered the 3 Whole Wings Plate, and we opted for Southern (for no heat).  The chicken itself was very nicely battered and crispy, but it still had a slight kick to it.  For our sides, we tried the homemade cole slaw and the pimento mac & cheese.  The cole slaw were just fresh sliced coleslaw with a Thousand Island-type of dressing - we weren't impressed as we thought it would be more homemade and more creamier.  The pimento mac & cheese was delicious, as it had a nice little kick to it from the peppers, and the pasta itself was cooked nicely.  I think the taste was great, but I think the batter at Prince's is better (but in the mild version).  The restaurant itself is very new and hip-looking, and there's limited parking in the front of the eatery (look out for the reserved signs).

My prosecco was old , no fizz 
This is a disgrace ....",
GIsXAJtNBnLJhh3jShTqeA,,Had lunch there last week. Got there just before 11:00 so we got right in when they opened. Service was adequate.  We tried the chargrilled oysters. The flavor was great. BUT.... Most of the oysters were very gritty. I injured a tooth on something in one of them.  One of the other people at the table pulled shell fragments out of a couple oysters.  The seafood étouffée was excellent.,
GJJNEtTPYCcpo9qN6rrYhg,"Some of the best fried chicken on the planet.  Cafeteria-style service and huge crowds are a bit of a turn-off, but well worth the wait.

They have a tasty heat level-- it's not mouth burning for no reason-- it's a flavorful heat. Prices aren't bad either... You can get a wing and a breast as well as two sides for $9.75 (which includes tax). 

I love how all of their chicken is served fresh out of the fryer and is hot and moist. The skin maintains is crispness too. Fast service despite the long lines and popularity. This is a destination worthy spot!",,

My friend ordered the ""Taste of New Orleans"".  She enjoyed her meal as well, she especially liked the red beans and rice.  

The ambiance of the place read as a Cajun Olive Garden, very fun and lively.  I didn't order any dessert, but I immensely enjoyed the crabcakes.

GMRwQHeBbpkgeUAC5qfpLg,,"Efficient. Has a reputation, so has a line, but line is well-managed. Ambiance is what one wants in an oyster house: simple, some neon, could skip the sports tv, marble counter where one can watch trays of oysters get shucked by experienced staff. Char-grilled oysters are wayyyy over-rated, as salty cheesy topping smothers fresh oyster possibility, but shrimp étouffée  is nice with just enough rice & shrimp, not too spicy. Good intro to cuisine, bit touristy and that's ok.",

Everything everyone else got was delicious aside from the oysters, and the service was much enjoyed by all! Put this one on your list!",
GNH-YxTr48X2Qv4QhwVFMQ,,,"This was disappointing. The presentation of the oceana oysters was unappetizing and the flavor was lacking in a major way. I sent back the crab cakes because they were cold and hard. In pretty sure they were frozen prior to heating them. When I told the waiter he responded ""do I need to warm them for you""...Um no."
GNJsA6a4I8FRxu1WDbDxeQ,"There's a reason Hattie B's is so widely renowned. This isn't the original, but they do Nashville hot chicken right.

I waited around 45 minutes in line to place my order. An additional 10 minutes to get my food. This was to be expected.
It was worth the wait. I ordered the ""Damn Hot"" small dark portion. It was slightly below the hottest they offer. I had to simmer my heat levels after experiencing Prince's a couple hours earlier. However, the spice level was on point. I still felt it on my lips, but it was nothing unbearable. The chicken itself was wonderful. It was moist, juicy, and delicious. I could tell the quality of chicken here differs compared to elsewhere. They've got some good chicken straight up.
Sides were also wonderful. Potato salad and the pimento Mac n Cheese were awesome. They were complimentary to the spiciness of the chicken I had.
The service was impeccable. People bringing the food out, and willing to take it from you when you're done. Really friendly atmosphere and vibe from patrons and employees alike.

Prior to leaving Nashville, I had to order some more and I got the ""Shut The Cluck Up"" spice level. This is a noticeable difference from their ""Damn Hot"" level. I felt this one afterwards. And that's what I wanted. So props to Hattie B's for giving me that sensation.

I'm an outsider visiting Nashville, so my opinions of hot chicken are probably moot. I'm not a purist by any means. But, I am an extreme spice lover.
When it comes to overall experience and taste, Hattie B's is the best I had in Nashville.
I would highly suggest anyone's first experience with hot chicken to be at this place. Chicken quality is great. Spice levels aren't overbearing, but can be if you want it to (depending on what spice level you order). 

Hattie B's is an institution that derived from the original purveyors and just put their own twist on it. I think they've done a wonderful job.",,
GNYVHDFk7b_shtyAupw9AQ,,"I gotta say the oysters here are really fresh.  We ordered a dozen raw oysters and a dozen chargrilled oysters.  I usually eat the raw but having tried the chargrilled for the first time...WOW...pretty freakin' good!  Both were so good we ordered another dozen of each.  I think we could have ordered a 3rd dozen but we had other food coming.  I am now a fan of grilled oysters and Acme Oyster House!

The gravy fries here are good too.  A must come if you are in NOLA.",

GOT9-LWiVpsFXMoTqrnlWg,,"This place is purely delicious! I was staying with my friend and her husband for a few days in New Orleans. My first night in the city, they took me to Acme Oyster House. This was on a Sunday night, so the place was packed! We waited in line for about 25 minutes but the food was surely worth it. I've never had oysters before and don't necessarily prefer them, however, my friend's husband told me I had had had to try the chargrilled oysters! And boy, was he right! They were grilled, buttery, garlicky, they definitely hit the spot after my flight. I also threw in some hot sauce to spice things up. 

I also ordered a shrimp po'boy. The actual po'boy tasted fine, I just wish they could have spiced it up a bit more without me having to add hot sauce to it. Our server was very polite and when I asked her certain questions about the menu, she was able to give me a clear, honest answer. 

You can see employees on the side chucking fresh oysters. Typical New Orleans vibe! Food tastes and smells great, and it's located right off of Bourbon Street! I would recommend this place to my friends visiting New Orleans! I've already told a bunch of people about the chargrilled oysters!",

As well for the entree we had the blackened red fish topped with shrimp and crab with a romulade sauce over a bed of jambalaya rice with a side of smoked mustard greens, VERY GOOD!!! As well, you have to try the Tropical Storms, great drink but drink slowly, goes down like Kool Aide but has a kick latter."
GQZE7-okmlUvrRCq9dJ77A,,"Very good raw oysters and jambalaya, do yourself a favor and skip the gumbo. 

ACME Oyster House is a classic. My mom took me here the first time I came to NOLA, and I wanted to repeat the trip. 

Now, my two person party did have to wait a few minutes, and we were sat at a 6-top along with three other couples. Not a big deal, but for some, that could be a turn off to dining here. 

We ordered a half-dozen raw oysters and the New Orleans Medley containing jambalaya, red beans and rice with sausage, and a cup of gumbo. Everything was very good, but the jambalaya was my favorite. It had such great flavor. I would recommended skipping the gumbo because it tasted a bit too much like gravy. 

I'll definitely return the next trip to NOLA, but next time, I'll be getting a full dozen oysters.",
GQgH--hxKJisGmfsKj0xDA,"I have to admit that i kind of cheated with this - i did not visit the actual restaurant - i used postmates for delivery to my hotel - but i am so glad it did!  I have watched several food shows that come here and compare this to Princes and I wanted to try either one.  This was what was closest to my hotel so this is what i got.  I ordered what seems to the mainstream choice - (2) large white with - (2) sides.  (baked beans, cole slaw) + sweet tea.  As a northerner you have to know that we don't really do sweet tea - we actually do Unsweetened tea - but when in Rome... this tea was not super sweet - it was perfect!  
The chicken ""hot"" level i got was medium and i would kick it up a notch next time but it was juicy and delicious and still piping hot and that simple slice of white bread that caught all the juices and spices from the chicken was a great little surprise.  Homemade cole slaw and homemade baked beans.  Baked bean were a little tangy with bacon - I'm not a baked bean fan but it was worth a shot.  This last mean in Nashville was a home run.  While I cannot compare this to Princes - I give this place 2 thumbs up.",,

On a Tuesday night, the wait was about 20-30 minutes. They've got a water cooler outside which helps with the wait, but the minutes passed by quickly with good company. The cashier was very friendly and patient. The service was pretty fast. 

I got the small dark meat chicken plate which comes with 2 sides, bread, and a pickle slice. I really enjoyed the fried chicken -- moist chicken, crispy skin/coating, and a good size. It paired nicely with the pickle and slice of white bread, which is a combo I've never heard of before. I enjoy spicy food, but I can't handle too much spice so I got the mild. It had a good touch of spice still so I liked it. The cashier told me that the next level up (moderate/medium) had comparable spice to buffalo wings. 

I got the pimento mac and cheese as my first side. Tasted pretty good, but nothing out of this world. I didn't like the black eyed pea salad that much - had too much vinegar, was on the sour side and didn't end up finishing it.",,

Not too chewy and fried to perfection. The dipping sauce had a nice level of spice. The charbroiled oysters were to die for! So perfectly seasoned that Tabasco wasn't even needed. The seafood gumbo was good and not too spicy. Just enough seafood within it. The fish were fried great and were so light! None of the fried food was greasy. I would have to say that if you are in NOLA, you have to eat at Acme.","This place wasn't what I thought it would be. The staff is super quick and friendly. Food was brought out fast and fresh! We were placed at a table with an open window to the outside walkways. The gator tail bites were good! Not too chewy at all. We ordered a fried catfish po boy and a fried oyster po boy. Both were delicious, however the catfish was a tiny bit better. It was flaky and not greasy. Despite the name, the swamp tea is actually fairly pleasant in comparison to its looks. I'd say to try it just for its namesake."
GRgDWg2tCNAANaIcFKS2bQ,"HOLY HOT CHICKEN!!!

OK, admittedly, I am somewhat new to hot chicken, even though I am not new to hot OR to chicken individually.  And I like both.  The night before I had the hot chicken tacos at Urban Grub and LOVED them...thus my quest had started.

So, I'm told by someone in the know that if I liked what Urban Grub had, I needed to go to Hattie B's.  So, we make that happen the next day for lunch.  First, this place is small.  Seating inside is fairly limited, outside there is a nice covered deck to sit on.  After standing in line for 5 or 10 minutes, we both go for the chicken tenders.  She orders HOT, so, of course, I have to order DAMN HOT, one level down from the infamous SHUT THE CLUCK UP.  The chicken came out hot....and that was only the temperature.  I dug into my sides as a way to stall the inevitable heat.  The sides were great, I had the pimento mac and cheese and baked beans, both good choices.  Anyway, back to the reason I came.  The chicken was hot hot...almost TOO hot for me...almost.  I probably was a little too aggressive with my DAMN HOT for my personal taste, HOT would have been perfect.  I found out later that you can get a combo of heats at least on your tenders...I would definitely recommend this to a first timer.  Service was great, fast and courteous.  They have a few good local beers on tap as well, they would do a hell of a job cooling down the spice.

One of the only downsides to this place was its effect on my run later that afternoon.  I held off for about SIX hours, and I still felt it a little.  Oh well, consider that one of the takeaways....in addition to the fact that I may not be manly enough to hang with DAMN HOT.  Oh well, lesson learned....I WILL be back though!!",,

Now, now I have certainly had my fair share of fried chicken  BUT, hands down this may be better than my Aunt Anette's.

GTWHHiZlmokgOcOdl_TaVQ,,,"One of my go to spots while in NOLA. Kitchen is open late, friendly staff, and great location. Wide range of choices on the menu and a full bar. I recommend the crab cakes, so good!!"
GTiPH3_XMqWt7nVdO763jA,"Is it good? Yes. Is it amazing? No. Don't get me wrong, this place definitely does chicken right, the staff is friendly, but i wouldn't say it's worth the wait. 

The chicken was breaded and cooked perfectly, they delivered the heat (but I did expect something a little spicier from the ""damn hot""), however the flavor fell a little flat. 

We also got the ""hot"" wings, but they weren't very memorable. Again, breaded and cooked 

If you really gotta scratch this itch, call ahead and see how long the wait is before you head out.perfectly, but just missing that ""Something special."" We also got the following sides, collard greens, pimento Mac and cheese, baked beans, and the black eyed peas salad. The collards were good, the Mac was waaaay better than I ever would have expected, and the black eyed peas salad was cold and the perfect cool side to cut the heat from time to time.

The peach cobbler was good, but the texture wasn't the best. The banana pudding on the other hand, we finished that (kept eating even though we were stuffed).

Overall it was a well rounded chicken sandwich. The buns and pickles were great, inside there was a creamy slaw, and their house sauce. The only thing that would have made this sandwich better would have been if you placed Prince's chicken inside instead. That being said, this was a close second. But I must reiterate- not worth the hour wait... but maybe worth like a 30-45 minute wait.",,
GTkP5JhrwQGo8AoqdIpUYw,"Yaaaaassssss! Hattie B's Hot Chicken is the hot chicken dreams are made of! I like pretty hot food, but I stick with Medium and it's just right. The mac & cheese is on point and they have a nice selection of local beers. Get there 15 minutes before they open to avoid the massive line.",,
GUYtNq1ow5L_eyrqc49jWQ,,Great food and Great Service!   Perfect timing no line no waiting!  Woohoo!!   Started with Voodoo Bloody Mary -  so gooooood!  And Prickly Pear Mojito!  Loved them!,
GUelYT14wh3xEPhvWTvYXg,,It's good but I'm not sure if is worth the wait.  I think there are other places that have just as good oysters and gumbo (like the gumbo shop),
GUs6qYi8j7CKjgdpVRY7Ig,,,"I was hoping the food here would be decent based on the reviews, and while it was ok, you can do better at almost any establishment off Bourbon.  The Pappadeaux chain in TX serves better Cajun/Creole food than here. Service was acceptable but not particularly friendly.  The crab cake appetizer was not edible. Go elsewhere for lunch/dinner unless you are in a crunch or don't care. Mambo's appears to be part of the same ownership group, so if you are expecting better food there, think again."
GUsHNAwvZ8bGjdyBloIXXQ,,"Lived up to the hype. Service was good, staff were friendly. We were told the wait was over an hour but we were seated at the bar within 10 minutes (party of 2). 

Ordered the:

- Boo Fries - The gravy was rich and had shreds of roast beef in it. For $4.99, it is worth trying. 

- Chargrilled Oysters - AMAZING. CHEESY. DELICIOUS. I used the bread to soak up every bit of the buttery goodness that leaked from the oysters. 

- Soft Shell Crab - I really enjoyed the first half of the crab. After a while, the heavy batter and grease was too much to stomach. 

- Roast Beef Po Boy - My husband (who does not eat seafood) ordered this and enjoyed it. The bread was soft and fluffy and the roast beef was good (tasted homey). If you're a seafood lover, skip this and stick to a seafood based po boy. 

- Hush Puppies - Sweet and savoury with lots of flavour. Spreading butter on them makes it a dream.",
GVQ31eNviq0kbvBxXaMTFA,,"Wow! If you want gumbo and oysters, THIS IS WHERE TO GO. The first time I came here I had to wait almost 2 hours so make sure you snack before coming here to ensure that you do not get hangry. The fried oysters are a amazing, as well as the gumbo. I've had the fried fish, oysters (regular and fried), hush puppies, trench fries, everything is good! It is also a good portion of food so if you do not eat a lot you can share. If you do eat a lot you will easily eat everything.",
GVRgNiVPv55idPpwB3dZjQ,"Chicken is awesome!!!! Hot is really hot and the ""damn hot"" is just that. There is another heat level above that called @shut the cluck up"" which is actually painful. Lines to get in can be extremely long. Recommend going during off times.",,

GVvk7KWMPCvGGBklRykqDw,,,"We had a table for four. There was a line out the door but don't let that scare you away. First the wait was well worth it. But more importantly the line outside looks worse than it really is. There is very little waiting room inside. We got a table in less than 15 mi. Though. 

I'm not a seafood eater by any means. But I did want to try something with a Cajun flavor. So I ordered the Cajun chicken alfredo. It was delicious. The wife had the Cajun Ribeye. Also very delicious!!!!! I had to try a taste. I was here a year ago and I ate here and could not wait to go back!!!!! Here I am a year later and I was not let down. Try this place.  You will not regret it."

GWOMeksJ6fY3Qlvy38h0ew,"There are places you just have to visit.  Hattie B's is one of them. 

Small dark hot, pimento mac and cheese, southern greens.  My chicken came in 1 piece.  I mean leg and thigh were still together.  How am I going to eat this and with plastic cutlery?  Im not sure if this is normal in the South, but fried chicken dark meat is always 2 pieces.  Well I ate the best that I could with the tools I was given.  It sucked, but I finally gave up.  I left meat everywhere and I am not one for wasting food.  I picked it up and greased up my face and got down.  This is what I should have done from the beginning.  The chicken was juicy, super flavorful, and moist.  The crust is not what I'm used to.  It held so close to the chicken and didnt fall apart like most fried chickens.  I needed one more level of spice but all in all, a decent chicken.   The star for me was the pimento mac and cheese.  It sounds unappealing to me, but I needed it.  I loved it and wanted more.  My southern greens cut through all the heaviness and had an excellent kick to them.  They were cut a little large and probably needed to be shredded slightly more so I don't drip juices all over myself.  

Hattie B's a must visit stop.  Be prepared to wait in line, but food comes out quickly.",,
GWkFoDUEz58PPrtIqeFiqQ,"Make sure to go at an off peak hour and/or order online for pick-up, or else you'll be waiting in line for at least an hour.

Had the hot dark chicken combo. The hot isn't overly spicy when you're eating it, but you'll feel the heat later on. For sides, both of the beans are a must!! The mac and cheese was very watery, not so cheesy, so avoid it. Also, got the peach cobbler, which was okay, nothing special. 

Worth a try if you're in town, but not worth it to go out of your way to get some.",,
GWp3QVzp6-KBvoQ7ZfVJ4w,,LITERALLY AMAZING!!! Peacemaker is to die for and the oysters will change your life.

GX7aYT6GHOYaQfH0SKuwKQ,,"The craw fish and oysters were delicious! My husband ordered a plate with fried fish, shrimp, oysters, hush puppies, and fries which was also good and he also ordered the oyster shooter (I'd say give it a try, it's two oysters with vodka in a shot glass). The place is a little crowded, the group in the table next to us kept bumping into me. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this place.",
GXIiFdSvNo32kooVPFUkNw,,,"I really liked the atmosphere, the hostesses, and our server Mike. We ordered the seafood gumbo, the Blackened redfish etoufee and the Fried SHrimp platter.

the Redfish was spicy but not necessarily flavorful, the fried shrimp were great.

Nothing else was really memorable, an A OK choice for New Orleans fair, Amp up the flavor and I'll be back!"
GXM7t1K106oYbW_YbYvf2w,,,Xieaje was absolutely awesome! She was super friendly and attentive made us feel at home. The BBQ shrimp was the best I've had. This place is a must when in NOLA
GXPWdDdfoaK0BUXeiyiJiQ,,,"On our last night in the Quarter, we decided to stay in and relax at our Hotel. Oceana delivers! Which was a key in why we placed our order from there. We enjoyed the alligator tails, the cheeseburger, the ribeye, a side of crawfish tails, and mashed potatoes. All were very good. Reasonably priced, and delivered on time and hot and cooked to order. They brought plenty of sauces for the items, and everything one would need to eat in their Hotel room. We haven't been to the actual restaurant, but I can say that delivery to a room nearby is a PERFECT good local alternative to the usual Hotel delivery options. Authentic New Orleans food, reasonably priced and delivered."
GXTVlP-leWvm7hSOajaflw,"I don't do ""hot"" chicken (GASP!) but I LOVE the ""southern"" style chicken at Hattie B's! Pimento Mac & Cheese is killer and I promise you the baked beans are the best in town.  Long lines aren't fun but if you plan right there isn't much of a wait and our family actually love ordering online and passing the line to pick it up at the register.",,

GYAOmL28NP5KRoYUBq71dA,"This place is truly amazing. The major issue is finding a place to sit and park! I would suggest trying their other location on Charlotte Ave for a less stressful experience. Although occasionally their spice levels change slightly from order to order, I've never had a meal I didn't love at either location. Try the pimento macaroni and cole slaw to cool off your tongue in between the mouthfuls of hot chicken and sit near the drink machine if you can! It is a little expensive for fried chicken but I think it's definitely worth it. Happy eating!",,
GYFbp_P3M8oC9DSGm-Qk5Q,,,"Our appetizers were very good. Crab cakes and blackened gator tail nuggets. Solid 9s across the table. They tried to serve our entrees before our appetizers though which was a bit weird. The server was sassy and reluctant to take them back when we asked to get our appetizers first. The entres were pretty good, not amazing. We had the gumbo and crawfish étouffee. The craws were tiny and pre peeled. Decent tasting, but very hearty and pleasant. The gumbo was pretty good too. Not really sure what to think of this place, not a very whelming experience I guess. Kinda left a bitter taste in my mouth after sitting at the table waiting for the bill. Something just felt off. Ambiance is important. This place is lacking."
GYOc_DpNUcE81lGdorDyVg,,,This was one of our favorite places in New Orleans! The Crab cake covered with the crawfish sauce and the baked oysters covered in some reddish sauce were incredible! The drinks were strong! And our waitress had a great personality!
GYTh3Yv0XVpbCPR1SCyD0g,"I still dream about Hattie B's hot, fried chicken.  Crispy, spicy and deliciously concoted, it can never be replicated or produced anywhere other than Nashville. This is by far the best fried chicken I have ever enjoyed. I have so much love for this staff and establishment!",,
GYwyxg6vZNH6S8hV2TIeRQ,,"The best thing here by far was their raw oysters on a half shell.  Normally, I don't like oysters because they don't taste very good when not fresh (and that's most of the time from my experience). But, with a little convincing, I tried out the raw oysters here. Let me tell you, the oysters were so fresh! They had a clean ocean taste to them. It complimented the horseradish and tobacco sauce so well. The horseradish sauce here really had a kick! 

The other items here weren't that memorable for me. We ordered their seafood gumbo and etouffee here.  I think we make it much better back in Houston. I found theirs was quite bland IMO. Their fried seafood was just meh as well. I didn't really think these were very fresh compared to their raw oysters. Even then, when they served us Oysters Rockefeller, they killed the oysters. I didn't like them as much cooked. 

So, moral of the story -- just save your money and order the raw oysters!",
GZ7XopwyDjuJNbc6gRvj_g,,"This place lived up to its reviews. There's quite a wait, but once you're seated, the food comes out quick!!

Everything we ordered was delicious! My friend and I ordered different things and halved it all. 

Seafood etoufee - delicious!
Chargrilled oysters - phenomenal!! Must add the crab on this.. this was amazing!
Peacemaker po boy - soooo good!!!

The oysters were my favorite though!

Do not pass by this hole in the wall! Definitely worth waiting for.",

My husband had the Cajun omelette and our friend had biscuits and gravy.  All was delicious with huge portions perfect to aid the recovery after a night on Bourbon.  The courtyard is lovely as well, although it was not open for breakfast"
GZXE3yeNPXhi3s8iIUGIGQ,"Nashville's famous hot chicken is a must on a trip, and we heard Hattie B's was one of the best. We got there before doors opened so we wouldn't have to wait too long. The fried chicken and sides here were amazing (we had a large party, so we tried all the spice levels - even up to the highest one - and all the sides - the grits were so good!) but honestly, I think the reason why I would rate this place so high would be the superb service. Even with all the commotion and hot, impatient customers, all the servers and employees here were so smiley and cheerful and patient! They were willing to take our orders and help, and even recommended when we didn't know what to get. There were some small errors in our order, but they quickly and graciously gave us what we wanted when asked. What a great experience!",,
GZeRcprW27wmkIDZBeP74A,,"I come for one thing only: the chargrilled oysters. They are herb-infused butter and cheese topped decadence on a platter, served with french bread to mop up the remaining sauce. The rest of the food is middling and there can be a less-than-appetizing smell wafting through the back room if you're seated there. Nevertheless, the oysters are so compelling that I brave the line (it moves more quickly than you might think) and look past the restaurant's shortcomings to enjoy a half dozen oysters every time I'm in town.",
GZzEtAnA1QMOVn90uklqGg,,"After a little disappointed of trying top rate restaurants around downtown and French Quarter of New Orleans, which one really refreshed out mind. The best oyster in town for both chargrilled and raw oysters. And their Po-boy is really amazing!!There are always a waiting line, so try to be there earlier than lunch or dinner rush hours.",
G_G5T6xvgauhGZxZM-vAbA,,,"On our last breakfast meal in NOLA we hit up Oceana Grill as it popped up as a pretty popular breaky joint on yelp. We thought this place was solid! The service was friendly and attentive (particularly so after the inattentive service from last nights dinner at Royal House) and the food was good. We both got the same dish - the country breakfast but I got my eggs over easy and with two types of sausage while the bf got his eggs poached and with a sausage patty. My sausages were really good - I can't recall exactly what they were but our server recommended I try both and I did not regret it! I'm not a huge biscuits and grits kinda gal but these were delish as well in my book. If you're looking for a hearty breakfast with friendly service, I would recommend Oceana Grill."
G_XH3ik2Sa2zKHvjjUoYsg,The Southern hospitality was very apparent and it definitely improved the eating experience. The chicken is just the right amount spicy for whatever level one may want. And the sides are rich and truly comforting.,,

The double breading makes it crispy, not greasy.  And the HEAT! I've gotten hot and damn hot and boy, you're sweating!  It's that good. Perfectly cooked every time I've gotten it.

Not much to say about the bread, pickles or fries, but the sides are pretty good!  The mac and cheese is pretty good, but the slaw is better!  The beans and greens are good, too.

I also tried the blackberry cobbler with ice cream, the dessert tastes amazingly homemade.  

Overall, the service is unbelievely good, they have moist wipes, free ranch dipping sauce and are very friendly.  They even let me come back to the counter to get the cobbler and ice cream after we ate. Highly recommended.",,

The wait was too long the first time we tried Acme for dinner, but we went back for an early dinner a day later and it was no problem.  Has a touristy feel, but the dude in the seersucker suit eating oysters at the bar was no tourist...",
GaZbInYeRidAS3uwwUJyHg,"Damn that's some delicious chicken. Got the damn hot dark combo and saw stars for a moment. But seasoned spice eaters know you gotta sit through the initial pain, and then the true delicious glory starts to shine through. Or maybe it's just the spice delirium. Either way, for those who love spicy food, don't punk out and get anything less than the damn hot. It hurts, but it's worth it. And for dark meat lovers, this is some of the best I've ever had. Each bite was juicy and spicy; I was sucking on the drumstick bone at the end. I know, not lady behavior. But when you're dealing with this taste explosion, you throw dignity and class out the window and just enjoy. Though, the beer here is STUPID expensive. If I were a local, I'd get take out and enjoy some cold beer back home. Eff that line and overpriced beer. But that friggin chicken will forever haunt my dreams.",,

Sides were mac and cheese, cheese grits with bacon and potato salad. all were delicious but cannot compare to the star of the meal the damn Hot chicken.

Once I ordered my food the meal was not good at all, very bland with no impressive sides to go along with the fish that I ordered. I got the Redfish Oceana and was not very happy with the taste of the food and could not truly enjoy my meal without trying to constantly wash it down with water.

GcdYgbaF75vj7RO6EZhPOQ,,"Disclaimer: I generally don't eat fish and tend to avoid seafood restaurants.

As a non-fish/non-oyster consumer, I found it a bit difficult to choose something to munch on here. Luckily, I had just come from an early lunch, so it worked out for me to simply order boo fries (roast beef, cheddar and gravy topped fries).

While the reviews are mostly gung-ho about these fries, I really thought they were just okay. You have to eat them pretty quickly or they become cold and soggy. The meat on them was good, but I don't think I'd order the fries again.

The actual restaurant operation and organization was a turn-off to me. First, you can wait a long time while they find a perfectly sized table for your party. Make sure every member of your group is waiting with you or they won't seat you when that perfectly sized table opens. Group of ten behind you? Watch as they get seated way before you. Oh, and you're waiting in a line outside. Tough luck if it's cold and raining that day.

Between the long wait, the lack of meal options for non-seafood folk, and the low-rise table that looked like it was better suited for children, it's unlikely that I'd personally return. But I could certainly see how oyster lovers would enjoy this tourist haven.",
Gcgy7JsxoETsm0LYNVSBvw,,"I actually love Acme. The only thing is there is usually a line, but worth the wait. I like the half shrimp half oyster po boy.

To be honest, it had no kick of flavor (except other then cheesiness), and there was nothing memorable about it. It tasted like something you could get at an Italian chain restaurant. I wished that it would have had more of the NOLA flavor that you would expect to find in these types of restaurants. Secondly, our waiter was very nice but was not using a pen and paper to write down our order. In the end, one of our dishes (which was an appetizer anyways) had been forgotten. No biggie, but I would hope this isn't a reoccurring issue at the restaurant."
GdJj1npaUyjSF_EZ4Nwu4A,,,Fantastic service by the lovely waitress that told us all about the Gordon Ramsey story and the waitress that got fired 4 times and now is a successful businesswoman! The blackened redfish with the crawfish sauce was delicious! We had the house special oysters and I wanted to lick the plate!

Highly recommend as our first food stop here in NOLA!

Service was quick and we ordered through take out so  we did not have to wait.,"Amazing charbroiled oysters and the po boy sandwich was also very good. We went right at 10:30 am on a Saturday and there was no line which was great. 

This was my first time having oysters like this and now I'm absolutely obsessed. The bread with all the sauce is the beat part!",
GgHtMgaz5Gjw5nWbnxZ23A,,,"As the very first restaurant I've ever been to in New Orleans i can really say the service was phenomenal! Ms. D our server was so nice! She was patient, attentive (not to just us but to all of her guests) and extremely professional. She is truly a gem, thank you for starting off my trip on a great note. The food was incredible also. Definitely will visit every time i visit from now on!!!"
GgvY4A_e0r0TZLiaP2mmPg,"Be prepared to wait in line, but it is so worth it! The chicken is served piping hot, and the Mac and cheese is to die for! We will be back on our next visit to Nashville!

Gh5PkjjTafLogwg60lX2IA,,"Last November my friend and I traveled to LA for an ASHA convention. Upon landing we were tired and hungry! After yelping places to eat downtown we decided on eating at the Acme Oyster House because of their good ratings and the pictures that kept you drooling over their food!

We waited a while outside but would have waited longer if we did not decide to eat at the bar top. Our waiter was a friendly guy named Steve(?) who chucked oysters the entire time. He was awesome! He knew we weren't locals so he gave us suggestions on nightlife (where to go and where to stand clear from) and even introduced me to my first LA's brewed beer: the andygator! 

I ordered a pohboy (because I saw it on Man vs. Food and it looked delish) and it was amazing! Best part was it was affordable! After eating the pohboy, I was stuffed so I took an Andygator to-go and drank it while exploring the streets of downtown NOLA.

I would totally eat here again if I had future visits to New Orleans. And I recommend everyone stopping by and eating a few fresh oysters!! Heck, even take your very own andygator beer home with you (I took some to Cali!)",
Gh7a3aAOlB2zMRocFzGEZg,,"Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that Acme Oyster House is a New Orleans institution - if you visit, you need to get your butt over here for some fresh oysters, hush puppies, shrimp po-boy, crawfish.. and maybe even some fried catfish and slaw. Mmm, mmm.

I had a little bit of everything. Their fish batter has secret spices in it (they won't tell you, I tried), giving it a cajun kick that contrasts nicely with their house tartar sauce.

And their oysters were SO fresh and SO clean **Outkast plays in background** I normally dont eat oysters because even the slightest fishy taste or grit in the oyster grosses me out. But theirs are served on a bed of ice, and as clean and fresh as they come. I also really liked their gumbo and red beans and rice.

Our server even came and sat down with us to chat for a minute. He gave us some tips on what tours to go on and places to visit. What a cool dose of southern hospitality :)

You definitely won't leave hungry, unless you're a vegetarian.",
GhC4OUYMEPYwZeHfKmwmMQ,Waited outside in the cold for about 30 minutes to get ordinary tasting fried chicken! Way overrated! Also with all the success they are having why don't they enlarge the restaurant with more seating and parking?,,
GhGjYVkGf-B_8Vi5YtY-cQ,,,"Food was good, not great. Tasted more like bar food trying to be creole food. Service was excellent though and prices are what you'd expect. Just, I wanted Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and I feel like I got the bar food version of that."
GhnqHTT1vKkLc0Z1rGsQ1A,,"Do come here if you're visiting NOLA.

No reservations means you need to do one of the following to avoid waiting in a long ass line:

-eat at a weird time
-eat an early dinner

Remember, Southern food is heavy, so order sparingly and add to the order as you go. With that said, my sister and I over ordered (but with no regrets).

Order the following:

-chargrilled oysters ($19.99 for a dozen): sizzling chargrilled oysters topped with herb butter + cheese. Oh so good and decadent. Gluttony spoke and ordered us a dozen, but we could have done away with 1/2 dozen because it was so rich.

-New Orleans Medley ($12.99): sampling of gumbo, jambalaya, rice and beans + grilled smoked sausage. Great because it's a noncommittal type of dish where you can sample everything.

-half + half po-boy ($14.99): fried shrimp + oysters with tabasco infused mayo. Pretty good. Probably my least favorite dish of the night. It tasted like a regular ole po-boy.

-one fried soft shell crab platter ($16.99): This was hands down my favorite dish because I love crab. The crab was lightly battered, and its inert was slightly sweet. Oh so good.

You're seated in very close proximity to strangers, and lemme tell you, people outside of California are incredibly friendly. We chit chatted with everyone we came into contact with. So if socializing isn't your thing, you may perhaps want to avoid dining here.",
GhuLdIUsgDV_L9DEZK4rAg,"THEY KNOW THEIR CHICKEN!! You'll be turned off by the line outside, and very few people know you can order online and just grab it to go. Takes them about 20 min to make and it definitely beats waiting 2 hours in line! So I would recommend grabbing drinks across the street at tavern and order it online and take it to go. I got the medium heat chicken sandwich with the collard greens and side of Mac. The sandwich has some heat to it, warning if you don't like spicy. There is also a really good orange sauce they put on it which is delicious! I also ordered the banana pudding which is very similar to Magnolia Bakery's in NYC. Best fried chicken sandwich I ever had! The meat is so fresh and thick! My mouth is watering. Will DEF be back!",,
GifOXaNzg9RCpkHD-wzJpw,"Wow! Quite possibly the best chicken sandwich ever. And being married to a good ol Southern Boy I've had my fair share of chicken sammies. 

Had I known it was going to be so tasty I may have taken a picture in all of its glory before devouring it. The aioli sets it off along with the spicy Mac n cheese (which I barely had room for). 

I don't need to ramble on about this - just head over and put one in your mouth. stat.",,
Gij-URrKSdJ8QivUPu8LUg,,,Pretty good food. The prices are high but the food is good. Perfectly fried oysters and a great smooth Bloody Mary. Has outside patio seating
Gj8St4DR2oznoETlfyI91Q,,"We were there January 18.  When we got there, the waiting line was pretty long, but it did move along pretty quickly.  Chargrilled oysters were amazing; fried oysters were also good.  There was an assembly line feel about it, but a New Orleans landmark that should be experienced.",
Gj9V_V-SbHh2jWXa_psuBQ,,"This spot was recommended to us by the hotel
 Staff so we decided to check it out. It was a hop skip and a jump from the hotel, on the street it sat, you'd miss it if you weren't paying attention. 

After waiting about 15mins for a table to open up, we were finally seated. I can't lie, I couldn't understand the waiter, not sure if it was the mask or the accent but he understood us.  We decided to order a a few different dishes to start things off, so I ordered raw and  chargrilled oysters. The raw oysters were fresh and huge, and the chargrilled oysters had a nice sauce and cheese on it that was out of this world. My wife and son had the gumbo and said it was tasty as well. Next I went on to order the soft shell crab, I'd been craving this for a while now. Side note.... I hadn't had raw oysters since before COVID, I was craving those too. Okay, so the soft shell crab was soft and very meaty, best I've had. I think if I went back I'd order it again instead of something else. I also ordered a cup of the oyster Rockefeller, I wasn't that impressed. It was ehhh. 

All in all this was an amazing place to eat and I wouldn't have changed a thing, thoroughly pleased.",
GjFuzpMVFAz_BUBqwA-4Qw,"Yesterday we waited in a long line outside the door of @hattiebs in Nashville with the sun beating down on us, was it worth the wait? YES! I'd do it all over again for this delicious chicken! $9.50 for this loaded chicken sandwich, with a side of your choice. The chicken is deliciously juicy chicken breast perfectly seasoned, read: ~SPICY~ !!!  
Just an FYI the mild is HOT, so Medium is HOT AF, Hot is  and so on. Choose your spice level wisely! 


The customer service was great, everyone was wearing masks, sanitizing very often, and very mindful of the fact that we're still in a pandemic. Order ahead and take out is available if you would prefer that!",,
GjhV51ooyTM9GKY9mwuqoQ,,"After talking to a few people, this place was highly recommended and we were told to try their chargrilled oysters. The line does get long, we got in line around 5:30 and were told the wait would be about 45 mins. I suggest you grab a drink to stand in line with a drink to help pass the time. My husband and I also chose to sit at the bar because it shortened the wait. We started with the chargrilled oysters which were very good! They were the best that we had in New Orleans. We also had the gumbo and the seafood platter. The fish was very good! So crisp and fresh, it was the best fish we've had in a while. The gumbo was decent, but I haven't had a lot of gumbo in my time so I didn't have much to compare it too. This is a must stop, but I would say come early for dinner or try to catch them for lunch. Lines start forming around 4 from what we hear from the locals. Service was fantastic too!","Our Uber driver recommended this spot and I always try and check out the spots locals recommend. There was a short line to get in, but it does move fairly quickly so don't let that deter you. The place is a lot bigger on the inside than what it looks like on the outside. Staff is friendly but service was on the slower side. My husband and I got an order of the chargrilled oysters, which was recommended, and we shared the friend platter of shrimp and fish. This was our first time having chargrilled oysters and they were very good. Of course later we found out that chargrilled oysters are a New Orleans specialty so every place we went to after we ordered them to compare. Oceanas oysters we're okay compared to the others we had. The platter was huge and enough for 3 people to share. Overall, it was a good dinning experience. It does remind me of a fast food version, or chain version, of New Orleans cooking, if that makes sense. The location is great though, right off Bourbon Street so after some drinking you can stumble on in for some food."
Gjt-uAfqnbjERgolE7KlVA,,,"Even though this place is in a touristy area and is usually full of tourists, I found this place on yelp and decided to try it. It was my first Creole food experience. I order Shrimp Gumbo and platter that had a sample of every Creole dishes. The gumbo was an explosion of spices and flavors. I tried more Creole food in other New Orleans staple, such as Coops et al. But no place came close to Oceana. I am fan. Thanks for making my first Creole food experience, so yummy!"
Gk905DuhctS8dCTmCvC0kg,"I'm not entirely sure what is wrong with me, but I'm not a big fried chicken fan. The grease, the salt...if I'm going to eat something bad for me, it's probably not going to be fried chicken. But this, this has changed my mind. No, we haven't ventured to the ""real"" hot chicken places, though this scratches my itch perfectly. I am warning you, this is not the place to have a first date because it gets seriously messy. Parking is a problem, but in this part of town, that's par for the course.

I ordered the small, dark plate, hot with a side of Southern greens and coleslaw to try and sneak some veggies into my diet. The hot level was perfect for me, definitely some burn but not unbearable, particularly with a local Mayday brew to quench the fire. The outside breading had the perfect crunch and heat while the meat was tender and pulled away from the bone without too much effort. Very good. The sides were just okay, definitely not the main event.

My husband got the large white plate, also hot, with a side of coleslaw and pimento mac n' cheese. It seemed like his came with two breasts and two legs rather than the one leg that was advertised. Extra chicken for us! I thought that mine was quite a bit easier to eat, but that's my preference. A bite of his mac 'n cheese left an impression - yum! I may have been misguided, trying to eat a little healthier at a fried chicken place.

Seating is kind of limited. We ended up outside on the patio. Even on a humid summer evening, the patio stayed cool thanks to a breeze and the fans, so it wasn't too bad, but extreme weather might make it difficult to find a place to sit. All in all, we'll definitely be back, particularly to take some food home. I now have a hot chicken itch.",,
GkAk6VvQ1iT7omZF-qQYEw,Always good for some traditional Nashville hot chicken! It's a tourist hot spot tho so be prepared to wait in line!!,,
GkGRnqa9NUZK-913K3WIvw,,Oysters were sooo good both raw and char grilled. But service was only so-so.  And some of the oysters had shell bits in it that caused my husband to chip his tooth. So I deduct one star for those two things. Otherwise food is good.,
GkJoVXdtAMzRi3G0hdX2Ew,,,"I love this place and eat here whenever I'm in nola. However,  I was disappointed with this visit.  My fav....blackened catfish was EXTREMELY salty.  However, on the flip side, the Rajun Cajun bloody Mary was the best I've ever had."

They have regular oysters and chargrilled and both have great flavor. If you sit at the bar you can watch them prepare the oysters and it's actually pretty cool. They go through thousands of them a day so you know this place is great. The lines can get long but they move fast, so don't be discouraged. I would highly recommend you checking this place out if you're in New Orleans",
GlAzSEidpus-o5l0xpz_HQ,,"I don't see what all the hype is about. Went around 6:30 on a Friday. Stood in line for maybe 10 minutes which wasn't bad. The seating is family style so there's no privacy whatsoever. It's loud and cramped. The food was just ok. 

Ordered the boo fries for an appetizer. It's essentially french fries drowned in gravy and shredded cheese. Baltimore's gravy fries are much better. I ordered the over-hyped charbroiled oysters. Just meh. My mom had the fried fish platter and that is the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars. The fish was good! All of the sides are terrible. Don't believe me? Just ask your server. The potato salad looks like mashed potatoes for goodness sake! 

The people seated beside us ordered raw oysters that they said were nasty. Must be that gulf water flavor lol. They also had the soft shell crabs, which they didn't finish, and the charbroiled oysters. They also thought the oysters were meh.

I'm sure there's better food elsewhere.",
GlIZUo-IhmsqBGEsR-JEBg,,"The wait was a worth it! 

Raw oysters - a bit dirty but quick to be served 

Po boy shrimp- break was crisp and flaky and warm! Delicious and shrimp were great as well.

Medley platter- Gumbo was good but the jambalaya was by far the best dish. Beans were good served over white rice. 

Crab cake- deep fried and had a pretty good taste. 

Cons- long wait lines, small portions, pricey, overcrowded. Takes a while to get your food. 

But the food is pretty good and our server was a sweetheart.","Friendly service and they know their menu. (Huge plus) place is pretty big so you aren't elbow to elbow with the next table. 

Waiter was great, fast and attentive. Food was served pretty quick. 

Food was exactly what you're looking for if in search of creole. 

I got a sampler plate I believe it was the red fish, I got it blackened! Best way to have it, served with red mashed potatoes and corn for sides. 

Blacked fish was delicious, mashed potatoes great! 

Jambalaya and beans was about a 3 1/2 out of 5, fried shrimp were nice and big and really good. 

Crab cakes were by far the best I've had, and served with a special sauce."
GlcDkAnneXx0TyV9Dh0qPA,,,This place is amazing!!!!! I haven't tried such good seafood for a long time. My favorite is the crab cake in the appetizer menu. But everything we ordered was awesome!
Gm5nKtX9AYHsvj9d_25m0w,First dinner in Nashville!  Delivered to our room  - excellent southern fried chicken!  Mac and cheese was really good and so was the baked beans.  The chicken was so tender inside and crispy on the outside - so good!,,
GmDNbk3lToRbjZXcEBtUXA,,,This is a great place to eat. Plan on waiting in line to get a seat but it's well worth the wait. The duck there is really a must do dish. Friendly service. Don't forget the Chocolate Kaluah Mouse. Can be a little pricy depending on what you get but it's worth every penny.
GmNILDlwiYQ_HimE2r-9Yg,,,"Although this place had a line out the door, we decided to wait it out. We were seated within 10 minutes, so not too bad. David A was our waiter and his service was excellent! Kaitlin even dropped by to help from her neighboring tables. The Shrimp Po Boy I ordered was nothing to write home about, but got the job done. My wife ordered the Mardi Gras Pasta and told me every 3 minutes that it was the greatest thing she had ever ate, so there's that! Chocolate Kahlua Mousse was very good as well. I will definitely return next time I'm in N.O."
GmRcci8kgknB0cfq2cAOCw,,"Acme is the most over-rated place in New Orleans. But, it's featured on all of the ""best of"" lists and Food Network specials so naturally everyone wants to go there. 

There are far better places to get oysters in New Orleans (like Felix's across the street or the new Drago's at the Riverwalk). But, Acme is fair. Raw oysters are plentiful and cheap and everything else is fried (oysters, shrimp, catfish, softshell crab, hushpuppies, french fries etc.) They also feature the traditional New Orleans fare that is so fun to pronounce (gumbo, jambalyaya, etouffe, and poopa). 

It's good for groups. It's no frills. It's not really worth waiting in line for but don't bother telling the folks you're with that. Let them figure it out for themseves - or not.",
GmTZECA9pjqutuLFARX09g,Get ready to wait. Even at 11am on a Tuesday we stood in line for about 40 min. But wow was that chicken good once we made it inside! You can decide how spicy you want your chicken and the sides are delicious as well. One piece of advice - come hungry!! The sandwich has a very generous piece of chicken on it and it's definitely heavy. An afternoon nap is highly recommended after!,,

GmpSEv4b0AoIFATqNBu1bQ,,"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing!!
You come to Acme for the experience of eating some dang tasty oysters, and if you're looking for the best seats, look no further than a spot at the bar. Acme's shuckers are the boss of whats good and will likely put a few extra oysters on your platter.  
Benefits of being at the bar my friends! 
The oysters themselves are huge and full of salty flavor. I was plenty full after eating about 7 of them. The dining area is your typical divey bar and its always crowded which makes the place more fun in its chaos. 
If you can wait to stand in line for awhile, Acme is worth completing for an authentic New Orleans eating experience.",

Can't wait to visit my daughter and go here again!",,

GngwFJBooOrJDVKz6UEsSg,,"I think the reason this place has so many 5 star reviews is because many people don't get to eat oysters on a regular basis and so they see this huge platter and think it must be amazing. Or, they think eating oysters is like being at a frat party and whoever does the most beer bongs wins. 

Don't get me wrong...I think ACME has it's place. It's most likely a staple for FQ drinkers looking for some nourishment to keep up the drinking, but for me it has a different place. Generally we've been out riding bikes or walking all day, and if we are staying in the FQ that year (doesn't happen all the time) we will swing by (if it's the right time and the line isn't to long) so I can have my 12 oysters and my hubby get the Gumbo. This snack lasts us until our late night dinner.

 We are not expecting mind blowing. We are expecting sold fare. And that's what we get. The oysters aren't mind blowing, but depending on the year they are at time better or less than expected. (unlike a previous reviewer, I have not found them to be muddy and we always sit at the bar). The atmosphere is sports bar.

I'm still on the hunt for ""THE'"" oyster place in NOLA. If you know the place please let me know!!!",

the sides were good too, I got the potato salad & mac and cheese... didn't get to try their fries.

It was flavorful and pairing it with honey mustard gave it the right amount of sweet and salty. We got ""Hot"" and that's probably the highest heat level I would be able to enjoy without giving myself ulcers lol we also only did dark meat because it's always more moist and delish.....if you're trying to go for white meat because it's ""healthy,"" then maybe don't eat fried chicken?

Tips - This location has a ridiculous line so go to the one about 3 miles away in Sylvan Park! Don't be crazy and wait in that line if you do choose to go to this location. We ordered online and picked it up.

Great drinks - get the margarita ... cadillac?  It comes out smoking and bubbling and has great flavor.  Packs a punch.

Had the crab cakes with mushroom crawfish etoufee sauce.  The sauce was the best! They have that on a lot of their dishes so get all their dishes that come with this sauce.  So good. The crab cakes were ok (disclaimer I am from MD....).  A little too much filling.  I did take one to go and had it later and I liked it a little bit cold instead of hot - I could taste the crab more....

Also had the gumbo here (I had gumbo EVERYWHERE I went while in NOLA this trip).  Pretty good.  I think I am still searching for my 'knock my socks' off gumbo....where is it?  But this was pretty good.

Loved the atmosphere.  And at one point a whole sheet of fudgy looking cupcake muffin things walked by.  Those looked amazing.  I didn't get dessert but if you see that on the menu - I would reco by their smell alone!"

We also ordered hush puppies (10/10) and crawfish (10/10) flavor was amazing. The gumbo, jambalaya and red beans weren't very good very bland and they were cold.

Grf0w8uuDBaiVJcb5INO_w,"This review is for the takeout food only. Hattie Bs is definitely a tourist trap, but when the tourist trap is hot chicken? I'll fall into that trap.  

The chicken is prepared to your preference of spice. The levels are Southern (aka none), mild, medium, hot, damn hot, and shut the cluck up. We didn't feel like tearing up our stomachs so we ordered Southern, medium, and hot. The chicken is solid fried chicken. Crispy, but still very juicy, battered, but not coated, and the spice clung well to the meat. We all agreed we could have gone up on the spice, but it was still very good. The sides we got were fries, pimento mac and cheese, coleslaw, and bacon cheddar grits. The coleslaw was standard. No complaints. Grits were very bacon heavy, good texture. Fries were crispy crinkle cut. The pimento mac and cheese was underwhelming. The pasta was over cooked, cheese was runny, and the pimento wasn't very flavorful. Definitely recommend getting the banana pudding though. That was legit!",,

But don't sit next to a table of frat boys who ordered their food too spicy and have to p=blow their noses into every napkin on the table for the entirety of your meal.",
GsILHZExy3vm8BmATEg75A,,"Their chargrilled oysters are amazing like everyone else said.  The only regret is that we did not order more.

Other dishes like the fried shrimp/fish plate and crawfish étouffée were good / decent for what they were.  But go for the oysters - they will blow your socks off. 

Pros:
- amazing chargrilled oysters!!! 
- efficient and friendly service 

Cons: 
- line is too long (there are other places in the French quarter that also have good chargrilled oysters, so not necessarily worth the wait)
- the bread that comes with the oysters are a little stale",
Gs_Z8HnPdV5tn0-mdwcMiQ,,Most delicious oysters in New Orleans. Their char boiled oysters are a must! They have a kick to them and are full of flavor. The jambalaya is also delicious.,
GsdZeEuCyw7BJkUVoHuu2A,,,Being from Louisiana I'm use to eating good Cajun food and this place really impressed me. Good service and food was excellent.
GsiNTKKV2DvgD3TtTyiPEw,,Two words. Chargrilled oysters! We heard how amazing they were and they did not disappoint! There was a bit of a wait but if you want quicker seating you can also try the bar. We also had the seafood gumbo and po'boy sandwich which was good but nothing to rave about. We loved the chargrilled oysters so much we even came back a second time during our trip to have them again! Definitely a must try when in Nola!,

Gsq1iYZpNy8pPmDzo5-8yg,,,"I had heard how good this restaurant was from friends & it gets good reviews.  It was the worst meal I have had in New Orleans.  I had the duck.  It was a half bird, baked.  Then they just poured a sweet sauce over it before serving.  So none of the flavor was cooked into the bird.  My friend had the redfish.  It was the same prep method, blandly cooked, then a sauce ladled over before serving.  They were both so uninteresting that we ate about 1/ 3 of it.

What was good, however were the collard greens & mashed potatoes, cooked just like gramma used to make."
Gt5D_3ejNk1bSfEowLtjGw,,,Best food everrrrr! Bread pudding is fantastic! Ask for Pamela and she will guide you through the menu. She has a great personality! Great service and great food!

GtaQRR8EtmBmZieN4hnGxA,"About 12 miles off my route on my way back to Chicago. When I arrive the line was out the door. Immediately it's my back up plan of looking for another place to eat so I wasn't sure how long it would take to get in the building. I remembered there was a guy in the yellow shirt in the back of the line. I drove around looking for another place and past by the restaurant again and again and he was already in the building. About 15 minutes had passed. I thought not too bad I was on site, line was still out the door. Took about 10 minutes to get through the line, not too bad. I ordered the 3 tender meal of the ""hot"" with an additional tender that was ""damn hot"". The sides ordered were baked beans and the potato salad. The guy  taking the order recommended there banana pudding. They have regular soda but they also have a choice of sweet tea, unsweetened tea and also Lemonade. I had a 50-50 lemonade/tea. The food was very good, the hot spice on the tenders was just perfect, the damn hot was just that ""damn hot"". I don't know that I could've enjoyed all three tenders at damn hot. And I love hot and spicy food. The baked beans and potato salad were very good along with the Banana pudding. This place is definitely worth stopping by!",,

GuTMVudN7bOLmPpJ0K5LEw,"DELICIOUS CHICKEN. I had the hot small breast and my friend had the medium thigh/leg combo. I had the black eyed pea salad and collard greens as sides and we both  felt that everything that we had was stellar. So unexpected too!

It was the best meal I had for the weekend that I was visiting.",,

Gv_BjUXgTVUzoP2SDcDyQQ,,"On each of my three trips to Nawlins, I've enjoyed the Acme Oyster House.  But on the last trip, I had to wait for a few days into my stay as I was in town to run the Mardi Gras Marathon, and one does not want an oyster-related emergency popping up during that sort of thing.

Needless to say, the wait was worth it, and six visits into Acme's over those three trips -- that's probably 120+ oysters -- not one oyster-related issue, but a lot of raw slidey goodness.  

These oysters are massive, bottom of the Gulf, crude-oil-and-fertilizer-runoff-fed tasty devils, not the cute lil' farm raised milquetoast prissy flavorless ones you find at your local McCormick and Schmick's.  To enjoy them properly and cut down on the wait, eat them at the counter and talk with the Bad Mother Shuckers (according to ""Hollywood's"" name tag) working there.

So far, so good:  still free of hepatitis A through Q.  But in the first place, one does not go to New Orleans with high regard for hepatic health.",
GvxLScFbcBL2A0S8OcsmLw,"Fabulous food!  Was in Nashville for two days and ate lunch there both days.Mac and cheese was amazing.  I'm a big fan of coleslaw, theirs was perfect. Banana pudding was good but too sweet for me.  I also recommend the greens and beans were fab.",,
GwCcOcTD7WWel22mB2_DzA,,"The line at Acme far outstrips those of its neighbors, making it a clear favorite of this part of Bourbon Street. We don't like oysters and chickened out on ordering the char-grilled ones that in hindsight look a lot tastier than any oysters I've ever tried. In addition, they have a great selection of traditional New Orleans dishes that we enjoyed, but it must be the oysters that justify the hype. The space is small and energetic. It's hard not to feel hurried knowing the length of the line behind you.",

GwdTAuYeuJ01uXZU-XLpgw,Love the chicken! Even mild has a kick to it so be careful if you are not familiar with hot chicken. The very best way to try Hattie B's is to order online through their website. You can schedule the exact time of your pick up and skip standing in line.,,
Gwe2GVqiIge7QHdAI8d74g,,,Gator Bites!  I have to admit I was skeptical but they were pretty good. The food here is solid for the French Quarter and they make one of the best Sazeracs in the area.  Plenty of options on the menu too
GwkWzDZ7PU_9AYtugYCS9w,"What more can I say that has not already been said about this place? Great fried chicken and sides. I had the hot large white and while packing some heat, it wasn't tongue scorching. I would even go for the damn hot next time. Skin is super crispy and the stuff dreams are made of. Perfectly cooked and super juicy. 
Be prepared to stand in line. On a Saturday around noon we waited about 45 minutes to order. Once we ordered it didn't take but about another 10 minutes or so to receive our food. Well worth the wait and I'd do it again for sure.",,
Gx14sdmH6UGx4iAO9PO77Q,,"This place was out of this world! Don't be scared by the long line because the wait is SO WORTH IT!

The seafood gumbo is delicious as well. Plus the staff is super friendly! I highly recommend!",

GxSv5YtAxxnGxLd3r3oVkQ,"Truly awesome chicken and timely to boot. I went medium hot dark with the pimento mac and cheese and some slaw. I think I could have been perfectly OK with the ""What the Cluck"" heat level. I wish I had a picture of it as it was a beautiful red color. (because of the hot sauce) It was delicious and reasonably priced. If I had any complaint it would be that the chicken was slightly over seasoned. All that said, it is the best fried chicken I have had in ages. I will gladly return here whenever I am local again.",,
Gxa4qz0f_m7b6nRKbqNGkw,,"Went in on Saturday night a little after 8pm.  As expected there was a line so we had someone wait on line while we walked to get drinks.  Apparently they do not allow outside drinks in so by the time we came back we pretty much had to chug it down.  It is cramped, close quarters as described.  I was never a fan of oysters however I am all about giving things a couple of chances especially if it's at a spot that's known for something.  

Had the boom boom shrimp and craw puppies to start.  Idk what it is about the shrimp we have been getting around the area, but they are all disappointing with a distinctive fishy taste.  The craw puppies are basically crawfish in hush puppies which  had a mushy texture.  

The oysters were actually good.  We ordered both raw and chargrilled.  I was nervous because I could never swallow it down the hatch raw.  But went down pretty well!  Ordered the soft shell crab but was definitely on the salty side with the batter.  It was tolerable when I took the batter off.",
Gxb2EDmWj9r9Ce7uC7CrDw,,,"Horrible service, we waited outside to get in the restaurant which didn't take to long ;however,  once we got in the restaurant we waited for our Oysters which took at least 30 min and when they came about would you believe they were LUKEWARM!!! When we tried to resolve the issue we encountered two managers who seemed to be utterly unable to handle our problem or any problem at all for that matter. We decided to cancel our order after a tug of war of useless emotions from the restaurant staff. We were very disappointed and hungry leaving this restaurant especially because it has such good review."
GyAbnKgup4xFD-znzZJj8A,,,"This restaurant is the real deal! Great food, great service and wonderful waitstaff. We had the Blackened Redfish and the Creole Redfish. Both were excellent. Very firm, very fresh fish. We were never rushed., in fact just the opposite. We could not have asked for more. These folks have got it down! Thanks for the experience. Highly recommend you include the Oceana in your trip to New Orleans."
GyBqhBDtiFu-CFXHOrSaQw,"Theres a bit of a wait for food but its one of the go to spots for tourists so its understandable. The sides we ordered were mac n cheese and fries. The fries were nothing extraordinary but the mac n cheese was very good. I'm a spice enthusiast but man was this chicken hot. It comes both pipin hot off the stove and very spicy which can overwhelm your mouth if you ordered a particularly spicy flavor. Id start with mild or one step above that chicken at first just to taste. Nice atmosphere,  good food. Enjoy!",,

GybJu46UATLqlIJuAEtmZw,"This is some hot, flavorful chicken. I can take a moderate amount of heat and the medium kicked my butt.  The chicken is fresh and dripping with delicious spices.  The sides were equally amazing.  Beware, during the day the line gets pretty long.  We went around  10 PM and still had to wait in line, but it wasn't too bad.",,
GykNtq2SgxJgRnkvDmpv6w,,"We arrived on a Tuesday for lunch and there was no wait, which was unexpected but the place soon filled up. But the food comes very fast, you won't spend too much time here. The oysters. First of all, the chargrilled oysters, are, EPIC. I do not like oysters, my husband likes them in every way, so we got 1/2 dozen raw, 1/2 dozen chargrilled. And I tried some, and they were amazing, I feel like, now my life has meaning, they are that good.

I did not like the seafood gumbo, however my husband tasted it and almost licked the bowl clean, I'm glad it didn't go to waste. He said I'm crazy and that it's amazing. It has shrimp and crab in it. 

The boo fries were a disappointment, I think they are more of a local favorite and maybe a little weird for me. It's a bowl of fries covered with shredded cheddar cheese and a large scoop of beef gravy on top. (It tastes like pot roast over fries) so it's not bad. But it's not amazing.

The shrimp po' boy was a miss. But the hush puppies were good. My husband wants to come back everyday for lunch.

I will add that I got extremely sick soon after eating here, my husband and I ate everything the same for the last few days and he was fine, and after some pepto I was good as new. But I was experiencing very sharp pains in my stomach and we had to come back to the hotel so I could hang out in the bathroom :/",
GypsdbOqkqwKb1pP_4eANg,,,"I would give the 5-star for the friendly waitress answering all of our questions, though the food was not as great as we expected. (Food was still good!)

I'm not a big fan of gumbo... For the gator bites, we ordered a mix of fried and blackened. Careful with the blackened, they are quite hot, but good!

I like my crab cakes! Good amount as an appetizer. The veggie side has real small portion though...

Overall, our experience was good!"
Gyz8AkUWYYhapJHIRdvojg,,"What can I say other than GRILLED OYSTERS!  Sure, this is a tourist trap and, well, I'm a tourist. My wife and I ate so many oysters a weekend when Norovirus (sp?) hit the city. We didn't get it, somehow, but it was still worth the risk. A relatively small eating space, there was a wait, but once we got in, we got after those oysters. In a city that doesn't believe in greens or salads, the grilled oyster is one of it's best creations. Sure we had the bananas fosters, etouffee and beignets (or at least I did since my wife is gluten free) elsewhere, but the grilled oysters are the best and highlight of the trip!",

Yes, we waited for about half an hour outside. And yes it was worth the wait. Their grilled oysters have been one of the best ones we've had in NOLA so far. It was also a pleasant sight to see the chef grill the oysters in plain view of the dining room. I also ordered a corn and crab bisque, which was delicious as well. I didn't eat any of the fried seafoods such as fried fish and spider crab, so not sure if those were just as good or not. If you like grilled oysters, I'd say this restaurant is a much try.","Ordered two types of oysters here, the chargrilled oysters and the oyster rockerfeller.  Both dishes tasted as bad as they looked. They had more of a drenched sauce look than a grilled look, and tasted fishy as well. The alligator bites were alright. Kind of like dry chewy chicken. The catfish had lots of seasoning on it and was alright, but the side of jambalaya it came with was very dry."

We also had 10 people in our party so we prepared ourselves for a bit of a wait (or possibly being turned away if they couldn't accommodate our party size...) ahead of time. Not only was the hostess very pleasant but she also kept us informed on the wait times. She was also extremely welcoming and provided food/drink suggestions while we waited. Our waiter was also very pleasant and attentive. Last but not least the food.... OMG... the food was absolutely amazing. I had the chargrilled oysters as an appetizer and for the entree I had the special (fried fish, jalapeño cornbread, and crawfish etoufee) Everything was amazingggg.

My spouse had to ask for water refills and cocktail sauce several times. We ordered charbroiled oysters which were too dry but the flavor was ok. The soft shell crab was salty and the fried oysters were very small. Sure we didn't have a long wait but when we did about two years ago at least the food was worth the wait.,

1. Long lines, so you should be prepared to wait
2. Best for smaller groups given the limited seating 
3. Ideal to come on a weeknight vs. a weekday (tho there will still be lines)

and most importantly, the wait is totally worth it. The chicken is some of the best I've had. I got the three chicken tender plate with a beer and it was a fantastic dinner for less than $15.

Since I started traveling to New Orleans recently for work, I've been in search of the best restaurants that offer local yumminess. Acme Oyster House has been a recommended by quite a few friends so today, I gave it a try.

I waited in line even though I just needed a spot for one at the bar. The wait wasn't too long, maybe 10 minutes tops. As I waited in line I looked at the menu and decided to get a half dozen chargrilled oysters and one softshell crab. Gabe helped me at the bar and was very helpful! 

The softshell crab was to die for!!!! It was cooked perfectly and it melted in my mouth. The oysters too were amazing. It had the perfect crust but still very moist once you peeled the oyster from the shell.

I would definitely be back.",

Manager came over to talk to our group and failed to make us feel better instead she blamed a supplier stating we  get what we get. We can get better crawfish in Dallas  than this place...pretty sad.

H28VIAJTLIz4K-2yA2EWxg,"Really?! 2 hours. Be ready to wait to order and find a seat.

Decided to try this place because we thought it was a must try in Nashville. Mistake number one, we ended up going to the downtown location. Locals said we should have gone to the less busy one because it's the same. Tourist mistake. Mistake number two, we went during lunch time on a Saturday and it was 94 degrees outside. Rookie mistake number two. PRO TIP: Get the order for takeout, that's what most of the locals did.

As for the food... Personally, I thought it was basic. Maybe it was the wait and the hype? Maybe we expected too much? Give me some Popeyes Chicken in the comfort of my living room, in front of a TV and i'd be perfectly happier over this. Mac and Cheese was decent, potato salad was ok, fries were very tasty and crispy and loved it, and the Cole slaw was ok.

Let's talk about once you get done waiting in line to order. After waiting in this ridiculous line to order, you have to hunt down a table like a culture to sit at and watch  people as they eat. It's a free for all and you can sit wherever, but if no one is getting up then you're stuck standing. Luckily, after waiting an additional 15-20, we finally found seats and the food came out 1 min later.

I'd have to say, the overall experience was pretty terrible and the food was ok. Would I recommend others to come here?... Probs not. Don't wait in the line. But if you have to try this place, go to the other location or order takeout. Just my opinion.

I need a friend chicken redemption!

I will say this: The chargrilled oysters are out of this world. Amazing. Swimming in butter and garlic. I could make a meal off of them alone (although it would take several platters)!

The po-boys are ok. It is a sandwich of fried seafood, after all. We tried both the soft-shelled crab po-boy and a fried shrimp po-boy. 

The place is really loud, kinda cramped, but fun. Lots of TVs for football (the Saints pre-season game was on, so it was nutty). It is in the heart of the French Quarter, though, so don't expect to park anywhere close by.",

I got the hot and it was great.  I can't imagine the heat on the 2 higher heat levels. The chicken was moist and skin nice and crispy just like it should be. The sides were also fantastic between the for of us,  we got to try the beans,  pimento Mac and cheese, potato salad, and the fries.  No where to go wrong only which ones to get.  Definitely a place I would go to again if I get back to Nashville.",,
H2WhI7u2Zc-ozPnKBvhWwQ,,,"Best lunch value in the FQ....

Try the Blackened Smoked Duck ($19.00 for a huge 1/2 duck portion), it comes with a generous portion of jambalaya and veggies too.  

The french bread was just OK, but you will get so much on your plate --- you won't bother to eat the bread anyway!

We came back a SECOND TIME to try the seafood options, my wife had the Seafood Platter ($17) and she got a heaping plate of oysters, shrimp and catfish.  She said the shrimp was the best she's ever tried, and she has been all over the world! There was also a heap of ""hush puppies"" and french fries on this platter.   

I had the Blackened Redfish ($14) and was not disappointed --- a huge piece of fish accompanied by the aforementioned platter of jambalaya and vegetables.

My suggestion?  Eat a late lunch here (between 2:30 and 3:30 pm) and then you can skip dinner, because you will be so full!

Highly recommended."

My friend and I shared a dozen chargrilled oysters. They were incredibly buttery, cheesy, savory, and flavorful. The plate also came with some bread to soak up the excess butter in the shells or leftover on the plate. And yes...we also got more food on top of that! I had a great po boy and seafood jambalaya. Needless to say, I was stuffed, yet satisfied! We liked this place so much that we came the next day to get more chargrilled oysters! 

The ambiance is very fun. They had some sports game going on it the background. The staff is also very friendly. Overall would highly recommend!",
H3GKvxPP4vFhDAUu3PDGfA,Worth the wait. Get there before you're starving to get a seat. Fantastic chicken sandwiches and sides.,,
H3Hzvzyjgnc7jSFZ9U-Pag,"5 stars all the way!  There's a reason people have no problem waiting in line. The pimento mac and cheese, seasoned fries, tenders, potato salad, medium hot dark meat, hot white meat, baked beans topped off with a sweet tea and a Dr. Pepper--we did some serious work. But my husband, who usually shows his food-joy by eating quickly and silently, literally sang to his food!  He doesn't even sing to me, but give him some crispy hot chicken breast and he starts singing,  ""Always and Forever."" And after we ate he was going non-stop.  You know how you hear about ""food for the soul""?  My husband found his soulmate...he couldn't stop smiling!   I make no promises, but I feel like Hattie B's changed his life.   *I kind of wish I was lying but I'm not.",,
H3KdOkbtqNL8EFhYkcsTAw,"I visited Nashville with family and saw this place had excellent reviews. The first time we tried going to it there was a very long line so we figured it must be good. We went on a weekday when it wasn't as busy and I really don't get what the hype about this place is. We ordered a variety of chicken, chicken sandwich, and wings. The prices were ok. However, the food literally had a fishy smell but tasted alright. All of us experienced tummy problems later that day.",,
H3SQ7h02EF2k4iTWDbkkGA,,,"The food was good, the service was good. The bread pudding was amazing. It was a little overpriced."
H3Yiyowa-sAPGJ4e6isHJg,,Great oysters- the charr-grilled oysters are incredible and the raw oysters are also fabulous. There is usually a long line- I recommend going early or ask to sit at the bar if you have a smaller party. They have a small but decent draft selection. Friendly and efficient staff.,
H3naGNptGv_DurEh6MwGlg,"This place is worth the hype. The online ordering was down when we wanted to go, so we waited the line. We got here at 2 on a Tuesday and there was about an hour wait. The line moves by slower than you'd think, but the majority of the wait is outside. The good news is the counter to order is right there when you walk in. There was only one register opened when we went, and I think they did this on purpose so there would be enough seating for everyone. We got the food less than 5 minutes after ordering. 
I'm not too good with spice, so I got the medium-spiced chicken. It was the right amount of kick for me. The skin was perfectly crisp and the inside was juicy. The sides were also amazing. I especially loved the fries because it was crispy and had a nice seasoning to it. The pimento Mac and Cheese was also really good. If you're looking for a sauce for your meal, I recommend the Hattie B sauce, which they call their ""comeback sauce"".",,
H44tF2oF-eBDi3lMyxOMIQ,Always fresh food when i go there with my friends! The new location in South Nashville is awesome!,,

H55w4yiH1TIVPstLRfriuA,"Great experience at Hattie B's. They were recommended by a friend who traveled here from Florida and we made it our mission to experience The Heat. The wait was a bit long but understandable for such a famous location. We were able to meet new people while in line and learn a little from some locals we met. 

Flavorful and juicy, not too crispy but crispy enough for that ""crunch!"" When you bite down. I had the Mac and cheese and southern greens along with my chicken and feel as you can really go wrong in choice.

Highly recommend to anyone visiting the area.",,
H5BOUK5wI7KQHzOIMJEl3A,I love the wings and cobbler..oh and the mac n cheese!,,
H5QKTzZJwjyaVoE_RIMB-Q,,"I love this place! The raw oysters were one of the best I've ever had and the po boys were also delicious! They also have oyster shots, which sounds questionable but I definitely recommend you try it if you like oysters with a kick. The only downside is that the wait was nearly 2 hours for us because we had a big group so we ended up splitting into 2 smaller groups in order to get in faster.",
H5UOEtNSY4vOUDaXrJ8lhQ,,,Stopped for lunch and enjoyed the meal. I had the blackened alligator and mustard greens. Tastes very good. The service was good and it was not crowded when we got here.

Is there a negative star?! All around experience was so incredibly negative, from the customer service, general service,to management I can't fathom I'm the only one who has experienced this outcome.
-offers good allergy menu (+) BUT there isn't a way to order the food online.
-called 3-4 times to try and place order and got the run around, young lady answering the phone was seemingly very inconvenienced by the request to order directly by phone instead of the website (even after explaining that there is no way to order from the food allergy menu online)
-order would take 45 mins to arrive (no problem, that's average to above average wait) -OVER AN HOUR LATER NO FOOD, called and asked if there was an issue AGAIN it was A HUGE INCONVENIENCE FOR THE YOUNG LADY ANSWERING THE PHONE (couldn't give us any information)
-1 1/2 HOURS after placing order I called and requested the manager, HE couldn't give me any information (he called the delivery guy and came back on the phone and apologized)
-2 HOURS after placing the order food arrived, still warm (hmmm ... Doesn't seem like it's been away from the restaurant warmer that long( the manager's only explanation was the delivery guy delivered out of order basically placing the blame on him
-FOOD WASN'T THAT GREAT!!! FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE AT BEST!
-Manager called after the food was delivered and offered us a free dessert the next day if we came into the restaurant, I explained to him this was not an option because of the food allergy which is why we had to call in the order to begin with. He insisted on making it up to us in some way.
- Walked to the location the next day (everyone has bad days, why not give them a chance ) I WAS AGAIN GREETED BY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND GENERAL SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED
-The manager took forever to come to the bar (after he was called on the radio, 7 mins later one of the servers went and physically told him to come over - manner said he didn't hear it the request... THOUGH HE HAD AN EARPIECE IN SO HE COULD HEAR THE RADIO )
-AT THIS POINT I'M SO OVER SECOND CHANCES, JUST REFUND THE MEAL! He couldn't offer a refund for the trouble because "" it would mess up his accounting ""(?)  Manager kept insisting we give them another chance the acknowledgment and customer service was so bad at that point he couldn't pay me to eat another meal there or from there

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY paid $55 for 2 mediocre meals, bad service and incompetent management"
H5jfhT2AVhH83dmGz3RchQ,,There is a very good reason this restaurant has been around as long as it has. Just go there and you will see. It's a small place but the food will leave you wanting more. The grilled oysters are a must have and I have to say I an a hush puppy nut and they have some of the best. I don't normally get fried seafood but theirs is the best not greasy at all and very flavorful. Get there early as they do get a line but trust me you will be very happy you did.,
H5omM1avSEDE6wQk6XFAxA,,,Omg!! This food was so delicious!! The staff was all wonderful and so attentive. Ashleigh was a delight to have as a server. She took the initiative to split our checks without us asking which was perfect for a party of 8. This will always be my go to spot in Nola!!!
H61O6Alrl1jjJT9T5BC8ZQ,,,"This place is so good!!!!! Right across the street from our hotel we came here for breakfast and we're pleasantly surprised. Our waitress Bridget was fantastic! She was so sweet, attentive, and the service was superb, southern hospitality at its finest!!! Highly recommend this place!!"

H66RPlgP_mRhTmaTCzLKeg,"Hattie B's is a Nashville 'must' and institution.  My wife and I both ordered the 1/2 chicken 'Hot', a side of pimento Mac and Cheese, greens and creamy coleslaw.  Souvenir cups yielded two draft beers as a result.  Everything was out of this world and the 1 hour wait in line always builds the anticipation.  
I think most locals order online and they text you when your order is ready, which cuts the wait to about 30 minutes. (Just a guess though). 
Several of the people we met in line were actually traveling through and always stop to get their Nashville Hot Chicken Fix!  

-We will return!",,
H6WXL9P4pu26R6y2m20Zbw,Great food. Awesome sides. The place is very limited on space. Highly recommended ordering online and picking it up. Collard greens were on point!,,
H6e0nkazdmTyIKkfSG0pRQ,I've never been to Nashville before and I knew I had to find a place that served fried chicken! We were staying at a hotel 2 minutes away and came in for dinner. The atmosphere was nice and plenty of space between tables. The food was tasty and came quickly. I'm so thankful I found this location and will be back next time!,,
H6gM99kJByBjj1zzqGj1ug,,"Acme Oyster House...of course I had to come here for...Oysters! 

They have been opened since 1910 and have an oyster bar where they shuck them fresh right in front of you. I ate a lot on this trip to New Orleans, but I definitely had to get some fresh oysters.

Since I had eaten so much this day, I only got a dozen oysters (1/2 raw and 1/2 chargrilled). Both were amazing! The chargrilled oysters were buttery, garlicy and fantastic. However, for me, the raw oysters were WAY better! Super fresh super cold and fat oysters. 

I would definitely come back next time I'm in New Orleans and get a dozen more!

Great oysters and a wonderful atmosphere (this place gets busy). I'd recommend sitting at the oyster bar to watch the guys shuck. They are good! And super friendly!",
H6uSqXgjLk9rL9Fjb968dQ,Delicious!  I come to Hattie B's every time I'm in Nashville.,,
H72djgktbxpO1yEU9Rk9qw,,,It was around 2:00 and I went in for their oyster po boy. The host seemed a little annoyed at first but quickly warmed up. Food came out quickly and I was tell excited to eat it since it was my first meal in NOLA. Unfortunately the fried oysters lacked flavor and the fries were pretty soggy. Luckily the slaw on the Poboy was outstanding and saved the sandwich. The server checked on me immediately and then didn't show back up until the check was ready. My recommendation is to come in for dinner and maybe try the catfish po boy.
H7E0G-Kb78RPvqE0lZWsCA,"Excellent choice for hot chicken in Nashville because the heat level is consistent. I prefer the hot because it has just enough heat. Their hottest chicken ""Shut the Cluck Up"" will bring tears to yours eyes! Hot hot hot!",,
H7ddwusNxX2cN906eBMKXA,,"Really an dangerous place for  bivalve molluscs (specifically those of brackish habituation) as I have been known to consume them 3 or 4 dozen at a time. To be sure ACME is a great place for all your food needs (Gubo, Red Beans, and all that).

I know its a tourist trap, and such but seriously. Get here early and often.",
H7pj7sbXY3N-WSEwa-JfpA,"First time having hot chicken, and this joint did not disappoint. Prior to this, I did not realize fried chicken can be so good. While I am never a fan of the battered fried skin, this was much better, since was pretty thin and not so greasy. The meat itself really stood out--it was juicy and tender and not at all dry. Went great with the sides and sweet tea as well.

The only thing I can think of is that the skin can be less salty, but otherwise it was fine. I'm not sure if it is their spiciness levels or our personal tastes that are inconsistent, but we had the Mild and it really wasn't that bad at all. Personally I think I could've gone for Hot with little problem.",,
H8UK9AuPjHCuC6iLfmb0_g,,"Seriously has the best oysters I have ever had. I wish I remembered the guy at the oyster bar's name but I don't. He was friendly, engaging, and funny. He did all of that plus was shucking oysters crazy fast.  The taste was so fresh even after they were grilled. Idk if they have a recipe or just really great quality oysters but it doesn't really matter which one it is. They also have great sandwiches. I really can't complain about anything but the water. It was very gross but I don't think that has much to do with Acme and more to do with the quality of the cities water.",
H8YAKg3oWv3_7j7JF9yjzQ,Great food. Definitely something to check out. The hottest chicken is no joke. I eat very spicy food on a regular basis and this is up there. If you want to enjoy dont try it too hot. Get a meal with 'hot' and get a chicken finger on the side with a hotter flavor. Learn from my mistake. Was still awesome and worth an hour wait. Kudos for a great meal!,,
H8ag_EQsNpsBDvzb6-LsDA,,,Had BBQ shrimp and garlic mash potatoes.  The shrimp were being g and the flavor was exquisite.  We had the gumbo bowl and it was delicious.  From the outside this place seems small but boy those the food taste great.
H8o5f0IkhrcyadZkbrKYwQ,,I can't come into town and not come here.  This is a NOLA staple for my tribe.  The charbroiled oysters never disappoints.  The crab claws were as usual amazing and the service was pretty good as well.  The server suggested the roumalade with the claws instead of the cocktail sauce and she was spot on.  I will definitely be back.,

H91eShLITMvICZ60W61GAg,,,Best ousters I have ever eaten by far. These are buttery smith and have a very sweet after taste. I also love there duck with as a really crispy skin.
H96gWKXPFUZK87CVHDIN0Q,,,"Went to Oceana after reading reviews and it didn't disappoint!!  We had crab cakes which were pretty good but the real stars of the show were our entrees.  We got the special which was some type of red fish blackened with a crawfish and shrimp sauce over dressing and a side of fried corn which was delicious and the cajun jambalaya pasta which was equally as good.  Our waitress Jessica was prompt, knowledgeable about the menu, and provided excellent service.  Also appears the oysters were the hot ticket item as we were seated near the oyster bar/grill and they were constantly serving orders while we were there.  We will definitely add this place to the list of ""go to's"" when in NOLA!!  Be sure to give them a try.  The line was long to get in but it moved fast and was worth the wait!!"
H97H0kAUvBT2RHEIhreaXQ,I am not a fan AT ALL. I was so excited to try this chicken and it wasn't even that hot. It tasted like regular chicken that I cook in my own kitchen. I think transplants and tourist find it good because they haven't had Princes HOT CHICKEN.. I'm sorry but Princes is the best in town. :),,
H9ONCGRNVtjiG3LsAI4ICQ,Chicken wasnt anything impressive nor were the sides. There is better hot chicken in Nashville. This is just a plate full of heartburn.,,
H9UDyc6ztdw6LSINhJMqzQ,,,"I was definitely impressed with the service, how large the restaurant actually is inside and the food was great! Everything was cooked to perfection. Had the taste of new Orleans with blackened crawfish. Will definitely be back!


1 Star-   Total failure of an experience based on this experience would not return. Would not recommend.

2 Star-  Below average on several levels, not a total failure. Wouldn't seek out to return or recommend.

3 Star-  Average experience, minimum expectations met. Nothing that says wow or that stands out. Would return if someone else wanted to come, not a regular go to.

4 Star-  Above average experience, will come here again and recommend to friends and family.

5 Star-  This will be a regular go to and will be highly recommended to people I know. Exceeds expectations on a consistent basis."
HA-eZrcpe1Uvj2aelz-Vpg,,,"Worst meal I've ever been served, anywhere, ever.

I got the special, tuna stuffed with crab cake.  Sounds delicious, but my tuna tasted rotten in the first bite, so fishy I instantly, and instinctively, got the feeling I shouldn't keep going because this clearly could give me food poisoning, ok... be brave, keep trying (I really want to enjoy my first meal in the French quarter), second bite wasn't as rotten fishy.... but what the, what's all the sinew like strings I'm trying to cut through?  Try the other end, same issue, I can't even get a clean piece of tuna cut from this sinew stringy mess.  This was clearly the tail end of some lower grade tuna that was starting to turn.

Waitress, she'd get a 5 star, she was very kind.  The disgusted meal didn't effect her tip, it wasn't her fault.  

Manager that took his sweet time to come see the crap I was served, he would get 0 stars.  He was so short, curt, and inhospitable.  His lack of care for this customer is probably why I'd decided to leave a review.  I'm sure he doesn't care anyway.

My husband asked for the bill, minus my meal, which was inedible.  He told the waitress to get us our bill, minus my meal.  

The crab cakes and oceanas famous oysters are fine, but nothing to write home about, and not all they are hyped up to be.   

I'm very sincerely worried I may end up sick from the few bites of rotten tuna I ate, it's only been a couple hours since eating and I have felt queazy since.  SMH."

HANbsjcp8fRJpV7X924-2Q,,"We ordered the soft shell crab and it tastes good. I'm really a sweet potato fries fan so I highly recommend their fries. The chargrilled oyster has some cheese on it, not my favorite but still decent. If the line is not crazy, it wouldn't be a bad choice. Today's special soup is Corning soup, it's also great!","We got raw oysters and today's special redfish. They are great. You can get 10% off by checking in. We forgot to do that at payment though, so we ended up with getting a raspberry pudding for free. The dessert is also great. I like their oysters so much, they are fresh and yummy. We two people ate a dozen, and definitely want more!"
HAebUd6EaqTXxd4I7OG-4Q,"There aren't many places that I would happily stand outside waiting in the midst of a spring shower for, but Hattie B's takes the prize for having some of the best hot chicken I have ever had. 

After finally conquering the line and placing my order, finding a table on the busy Sunday afternoon presented a bit of a challenge, but after some persistent looking my party found one. The food was brought to the table as we were handed a number after we ordered. I ordered a small plate, seasoned hot (this is hot chicken, you need to bring the heat!), and collard greens as my two sides. The amount of food served on my plate was tremendous and I had to share in order to finish. Washed down with a glass of sweet tea, the chicken provided the perfect amount of heat within the tender, juicy breast. The collard greens were also superb, especially with a dash (or a little more than a dash...) of pepper sauce. My table had a great view of the March Madness basketball game playing, which charged the atmosphere of the restaurant with an exciting buzz.

I left Hattie B's, passing the ever-growing line, with a full stomach and a new sleep shirt that has 3 adorable red chickens on it. Overall, I would say that this is one of the best places I have eaten at in Nashville, so bring an empty stomach and your patience, and enjoy the great food.",,

HBC6FIBHxo40h01tNhxn2g,,,"We got into NOLA around 10pm. It's totally awesome that places stay open late so that we could get a decent bite to eat. 

We got the crab cake appetizer, which had a good amount of crab in it. Had a nice flavor.  

My brother and his girlfriend shared the jambalaya pasta. They raved on and on about how good it was. I had a bite and I thought it was pretty good as well. 

My Taste of Orleans had Creole jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice with smoked sausage. It wasn't bad. The flavors blended well together."

We both ordered fried soft shell crab, fried shrimp & fried oysters.... they sucked. The breading tasted like flour & was too thick, you couldn't even taste the seafood! The co tail sauce was sour... all around gross!

The ONLY reason I'm giving this 5 stars is because the charbroiled oysters were delicious!",
HC5zLdut4caN1VPqxqRsMw,"Could not have come to Nashville without trying Hattie B's. Since we heard about the super long lines, my friends and I ordered online about an hour before arriving to avoid the lines. Although we ordered in advance and arrived on time to pick up our order, we still had to wait over 20 minutes for our food to be ready. It was worth the wait though! My ""damn hot"" chicken was awesome! It was the second hottest level and it was enough to keep things interesting. The meat itself was very juicy and tasty. We were all impressed by how well the chicken was cooked. I had mac & cheese, collard greens, and fries on the side. While they were all good on their own, they definitely helped a lot when I needed a break from how hot the chicken was! Of all the hot chicken I tried in Nashville, Hattie B's was the best.

Pound for Pound Oceania was cheaper, better fare.",Oceania Grill was wonderful. It is as good as it gets for tourist food in the French Quarter. The barbecued shrimp appetizer is a must.  Given the choice my family preferred Oceania to Acme Oyster hands down.

We got some coleslaw, mac and cheese, and banana pudding as sides, which helped temper the heat a bit.  The staff was super friendly and the place was really charming.

The line was unbelievably long, and we were in line in the sun for almost an hour. After ordering, we had to wait another 30 minutes for the food to come out. Each person in my family and I ordered a chicken and waffles meal, which comes with a side. I got the southern chicken tenders and waffles with the Nashville comeback sauce and pimento mac and cheese. The chicken tenders were soft and juicy, and the sauce gave them a tangy kick. The mac and cheese was good, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I got to try some of my mom's bacon cheese grits and really liked it! 

The portion size of each meal was really big, and my family and I had leftovers for two days. I'd recommend splitting one between two people unless you want leftovers for the next day. 

Overall, the food here is good, but I don't think I can eat it too often just because it's really heavy. Also, I'm not too sure if I want to wait over an hour when I come back. I would suggest ordering online to save you lots of time!",,

We had an early flight and were famished when we checked into the hotel.

The grilled oysters are sooooooo good, get extra bread to soak up that cheesy buttery goodness.  The po' boys the fries, the service wow.

Loved it so much that we got the recipe and some shucking blades so that we could grill up our own back in New York.

We would seriously fly back just for the oysters.",

I was a little hesitant to try Acme because I hate when oysters taste fishy. However the oysters here were so fresh that I did not detect any fishy taste. The addition of the house made cocktail sauce, fresh lemon and a shake of Tabasco made a magic combination of flavor. 

We also ordered a seafood gumbo (small but flavorful) and six chargrilled oysters. One thing that makes Acme's char oysters unique is the addition of cheese. I couldn't stop eating the sauce after the oysters were gone.

Service was very kind, and the vibe of this place is fun (also love all the neon signage). Definitely a must visit if you're in the French Quarter!",

The prices are a bit above average, with my small etouffe being $8.99, but it's worth every penny! The first night we waited 10 minutes for a table, and the next night we waited 40 minutes, both were for a table of five. On the list of places to visit in New Orleans, Acme is now right up on my list with Cafe du Monde!",
HGDe6LLkVuYvHM_By-66Ww,,,The pasta dishes we both had were excellent.  The server was very good at keeping our drinks refreshed.  There was about a 10 wait to get in as they were very busy. We would go back there again in a New York minute.
HGKpJ1dY-Nom6nIQvJ9Xfg,,,Super scrumptious! Taste of New Orleans was super yummy and enough to feed 2! Atmosphere was great and our server Chris was so hospitable! Thank you for your recommendation on the gator bites both fried and blackened. MUST TRY!!!
HGTdyEDygTqANThO64WDWQ,,"Came here in the middle of a Sunday when the Saints were in town and was able to be seated immediately. We had a stroller and the staff went out of their way to find us the perfect able and fast! There were plenty of TVs to watch the game and the service was great.

We had the crawfish (which come fried) PoBoy and hush puppies. It was excellent! The portions were decent size and it came out very quickly. We were actually in a bit of a hurry so this worked out well. We got the check and was in and out in about 45 minutes.",
HGWvIw7YAMNvAA4tEj1HIQ,,,"Went here for New Year's Eve. The charbrioled oysters were fabulous. Very busy, however we had great service. Definitely a must when in the Big Easy!"
HGuI59kVzo29qmJxUVm2YQ,,Amazing oysters love the garlic buttery preparation. This is unique of New Orleans you have to try it.,
HHG4Wa8axxPlsmV5sbHd8g,"If you come to Nashville, you gotta try the hot chicken. I've had some of the other places but Hattie B's is my fav joint.

The restaurant is a decent sized one but expect a line if you're coming during prime times. Parking is also hard to find too since it's right in Mid town. Indoor seating is small but they do have a porch that is much larger.

I always get the chicken tenders in the hot flavor but you honestly can't miss with anything on the menu.

Now when you do visit, don't be a girly man and get the ""Southern"" or ""Mild"" flavors. Go for ""Hot"". The ""Hot"" flavor is just hot enough to give you a nice kick without burning you too much. ""Damn hot"" is the next step up and is also doable but this is my limit. 

The hottest flavor they have is the ""Shut the Cluck Up"". I have yet to try this flavor but if you do try this one...pepper your angus and have the plumber on speed dial cause you're gonna have a bad time.",,
HHGVXC4chmUPWHd6Ci2XOQ,In town for the night because our plans got cancelled. Was recommended this place by numerous friends and family and didn't disappoint! The service was pretty quick considering how busy it was. The serving size included a good handful of fries and a big ol' sandwich. The sauce was definitely the boss. Would recommend to anyone visiting!,,
HHMjANFFQGjL6gVNkNE1lg,"Ok, I will join the local debate for Hot Chicken .. Hattie B's or Prince's. I am a Hattie B's person! I love the flavor that they are able to include with the hot. Hot, Damn Hot, Shut the Cluck Up .. choose your favorite and you will not go wrong if you are a Hot Chicken fan. Lines are often long but we have had good luck with the call ahead plan. Always bagged and ready to go.",,
HHnQpY1Bv87hOCPr9aVv2g,,"Look, there's a line out front for a reason. Don't be scared away by it, just wait it out, they turn tables super fast so you will be in quickly. As far as the food goes:
Boo Fries: Very similar to poutine. A very solid app, not a must get.
Etouffee: Delicious, rich and cooked perfectly. Definitely a standout, get it with the fried crawfish tails on top. 
Gumbo: We tried both the seafood and the chicken/andouille. It was good gumbo, I preferred the etouffee.
Shrimp Po-Boy: I know acme is known for the oysters but they make some good Po-Boys so you really can't go wrong here. 
Bananas Foster Cheesecake: if you have room for dessert and like cheesecake, don't skip on this. It was absolutely delicious, tasted like a caramel-y version of a banana pudding cheesecake. Light and fluffy, but still rich. 
Overall, food was great, service was great, and despite being extremely popular with tourists, this place delivers on the food. Don't skip it.",
HHp96KPsroyYDAHOwo_VSg,"How do you come to Nashville and not check out Hattie B's? 

This is some of the best well seasoned chicken I've ever had on a consistent basis. See, the issue with some ""spicy"" foods is that when you eat it you literally just taste spice - just a tongue on fire. Not here. Hattie B's chicken is hot, tasty and flavorful. Also the best banana pudding I've ever had (trust me I'm a pro). I've seen the lines but never waited in one that was more than 5 minutes or so long. I think that depends on which location you go to. 

Hattie B's is definitely a Nashville staple and a must try for anyone stopping in (or living!) in the city!",,
HHwF9Lfk_ocRO-eMF0jYEg,With the exception of the line (call in your order!!!) Hattie's does fried chicken a compliment.  Don't go to say Saltine across the street and order their hot chicken when the real deal is only 100 yards away.  Beware though this stuff is spicy!  Not like oh that's not too bad dip it in ranch.  It can get un bearable.  So start with the lowest of the spice and work your way up.  That way you won't have a bad first experience.  The sides here are also great.  Cant go wrong with their mac or collar greens.  Definitely a Nashville staple.,,
HI8QwhpeP_ZRY5JZy11VDw,,"There's a line outside this place for a reason. The charbroiled oysters were insanely good, I've never had anything quite like them. Only giving them a 4/5 because it's really loud on the inside and you can feel like you're eating on-top of other diners",
HIAU0RTaRUwJEoJUJ3rAIw,,"If you don't have to wait in line, go in and eat. You won't be disappointed. If you do have to wait, go across the street to Felix's, not as nice ambiance but the food is as good... In fact the grilled oysters were a touch better. 

I tried both restaurants back to back recently. At Acme I had the grilled oysters and an oyster po boy. The grilled oyster was delicious but a bit salty. The po boy was exquisite. Crispy fried oysters in a crispy roll. Sloshed down with a couple of glasses of pinot grigio.... lunch don't get much better than this. Companions had the jambalaya... OK... and the other the combination seafood platter.... very good. 

Reviewed by 500+ the place cant be bad just don't wait in line..",
HIVmQnN3njFGU-POCd5nLA,,Great New Orleans tradition.  Don't miss it.  Oysters on the half-shell are oysters on the half-shell.  Grilled oysters are much better at Drago's and a little better at Acme on Veterans Blvd. in Metairie.,
HIZqtKz7rnyzJIWK0S-UsQ,"Got there at the perfect time today. The line was only half way arounD the block. Waited for an hour and finally got in. The dude at the register was cool and fUnny. My wife and I eat hot stuff all thE tIme so wE ordered the second to hottest chicken called ""damn hot"". It was so hott it felt like my face Was melting. Chicken was perfect but to hot  for me.",,
HIeaUsj55S6PY06JXhx8Wg,"There are a few in Nashville we went to the one on Charlotte Ave south of The Nations area. The parking is very good, the staff are all quite excellent, the beer I had was cold, the food was all so amazing. I got the chicken sandwich with no heat, daughter got the hottest level Shut the Cluck Up and it melted her face off like Raiders of the Lost Ark. Just like they said it would! Also got the dirty bird fries which were so good I can't imagine not ordering them again. Could not recommend this more, a must stop.",,
HItLH-Eb_DJk7A1k5a_EhQ,,"I only eat charbroiled oysters, and these were fair.  There are much better choices out there.  The ACME name, affectionately, reminds me of the cartoons of my childhood days, and the long lines to get in are just as funny!  A little advice for all the new tourists, like I once was, Go to Dragos!","Delicious.  I ventured out for the alligator sausage in my omelet, and I loved it.  They combined two omelets for this picky eater.  The biscuits and gravy did not disappoint.  With so many places to choose from, I look forward to trying lunch and dinner."
HJDf5l7YSz-apP7Z3RRMvA,,"Waited in line maybe 10-12 minutes, then seated promptly.  Food was excellent.  Crab cake with Corn Moque Choux was an excellent appetizer.  I had half a shrimp Po-Boy with a small bowl of sausage gumbo and a side of hush puppies.   Delicious!  I got bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  You better run and shut the door for that one.  It was fantastic.  Place was packed but our server was prompt and we got our food fairly quick.  Would definitely recommend.  You may have to wait in line but it's worth it in my opinion.",
HJGsDe8RHvcgceU1kgjIkQ,,"Yelpers. Calm down. There's a line outside and right now that emotion urging you to renegade with the masses as if the Pope was handing out rosaries is warranted, but air is needed. Breath. Rational behavior must be employed. The second coming of oyster heaven only meets a 3 star review and is not worth the illustrious wait if a full meal is desired.

The chargrilled oysters are simply decadent. I mean -- that is one amazing creation. If you wish to stand in line for this legend, no one will second guess your decision. However, if you are in line for literally anything else you may be very well wasting precious moments that could be spent elsewhere. The food here is wildly average and if not for the amazing brilliance of the chargrilled oysters I would suggest a 2 star rating. 

Yelpers. Now that air has entered your lungs and the gravity of the line situation has negotiated a reasonable calmness -- ONLY stand tall if awaiting the oysters. If you wish to consume anything else, head to an alternative choice. Lines demand epic tastes, which Acme has only one of.",
HJImtzPqQECEIHeAJbydsA,,"At many restaurants in and around the French Quarter staff can be unfriendly and rude after just dealing with tourists all day, every day. This is NOT the case at Acme. The service was great and friendly. Our waiter was phenomenal, gave tips on the menu, and was constantly filling needs even with a packed house. The Charbroiled oysters are great and are pretty much a necessary item if eating at Acme.",
HJdFNtGwRUpDI6KvorA4cw,"Hattie B's, as you can see by their reviews, is one of the top hot chicken places in Nashville.  Given that Nashville prides themselves on their hot chicken like Philly does its cheesesteaks and NY does its pizza, this means its a pretty big deal.  Get here with time to spare because if there's a line you will wait for awhile regardless of how quick it's moving.  They even put out some water for those waiting in the sun which is nice/smart.  You order inside, grab your number, and then sit on the porch to sit and wait at picnic tables for the food.  I'd advise grabbing a beer, as they had at least 8 taps of local microbreweries.  I had a Blackstone Black Kolsch which ended up being one of my favorite beers of my trip.  I'm a beer guy, and I'm saying Nashville is seriously underrated for its beer.

I got the medium tenders with pimento mac n' cheese and collard greens, and my girlfriend got the mild tenders with fries and cole slaw.  I thought I was being a bitch for only ordering the medium.  I lamented this decision until I bit into the first tender.  Oh wait, nevermind.  Even the medium here was super hot, and I'm saying that as someone who used to work in an Indian restaurant.  The chicken was perfectly crisp, the spice blend was dominant but not overwhelming with lots of flavor, and the meat itself was great quality.  My girlfriend cursed me the whole time as even the mild was too much for her.  ""Who the fuck would this be mild for?!"" I believe is how she ever so delicately put it.  At the same time, she couldn't put the chicken down and neither could I.  That's a sign of truly amazing food right there.  All of the sides were really good with the pimento mac 'n cheese standing out for me.  Did I mention it wasn't even $25 for lunch for 2, including drinks?

A pair of gentlemen next to us had opted for the hot option on their chicken, and were sweating profusely as they openly regretted their decision.  I think this was God's way of telling me I had dodged a bullet.  Either that, or an open challenge for next time.  Oh, there will be a next time: both for Nashville and definitely for Hattie B's.",,
HK6GbqU8RG2QiTa195MRug,,"Ok, so let me just say that I have only been here when Haliburton had the place shut down for an appreciation day that I was invited to- but this place was freakin great.  The char-grilled oysters were unreal, and the drinks were every thing a New Orleanian could hope for.  I tend to stay out of the quarter especially during busy times of the year, but this is a great place I would go back to again.",
HK9N2er0g4CEZlCyL3UHow,"This place is a regular stop for me when I travel to Nashville for work.  For around 13 bucks you can get a small white or dark basket with two delicious sides, a cup of banana pudding, and a pint of beer.  
Let's talk about the chicken.  I've had both Hot and Medium levels of the dark, and each time I have devoured everything down to the bone.  If I didn't get full so quick, I'd order the large which is essentially double the small.  The chicken is fried to a perfect place of tenderness and taste.  The level of seasoning is made to order, from mild to hot, and for the adventurous a super hot option.  If you've never tried hot chicken, make Hattie B's your first experience.
The sides are great as well.  I've had the baked beans and cole slaw, which are great in their own right.  
Top it off with a cup of Southern banana pudding.  It's required!  Wash it down with any of the local brews they serve on tap, they keep a good selection here.
Don't be too concerned about seating, unless the line is out the door.  You can sit inside, or out on the covered patio, where there is ample seating.  They keep it going year round, with it open in the warm season, and closed and heated in the winter.  One of my favorite places to sit is on the stools outside looking on the street at all of the people stopping at the cupcake shop next door, or walking from the bars down at the intersection.  It's a cool place not far from Music Row.
Parking can be tough, but there are places nearby marked with red signs for Hattie B's parking.  
Do not miss this place if you are here for work or pleasure.  It's a real treat.",,
HKgpEPhuAbNnu2zeneTYpQ,"Classic. Simply put, go. 

Don't order the ""naked"" please! Tourists are afraid of spicy food and don't realize that ""mild"" is truly mild. ""Medium"" is like your favorite salsa heat. 

Take a chance! 

Don't miss the pimiento Mac and cheese or the Greens. 

Top notch food, expect to wait in line.",,
HLCMb9E8H2Ph7ouaiJNhzg,,,"Absolutely love this place. Charbroiled oysters and poboys are great!!

Also get a Bloody Mary. So good!

HLSdvLpaSDZ1JPoIASHniA,This place is awesome! We waited 2 hours in 90 degree just to eat this chicken. I had the half chicken with Mac and cheese and collard greens. It was amazing. The chicken was so tender and delicious. Loved it. Would definitely go back here no matter how long the air is.,,
HLlOOmIrpb8c7_3voE2HCA,,,"Came to Oceana Grill on the late night while I was in town for my birthday. My date and I were the second to last table to be seated because we came so late but the bartender and waitress still gave us great service. We had the famous oysters, gumbo and shrimp with crawfish along with a few drinks. Everything was exceptional, it was the start of a great birthday night."
HLm1afI28ZJtsOAwemfX_g,,"BOOOOOO FRIES!!!!! This place has excellent food. The Boo Fries and grilled oysters were fantastic. The service was good, Overall a great experience. The line was a little long to get in, but it moves fairly quick.

HM9WFhkwfFonmaicSdjK_g,"Fantastic chicken. Would travel here from Cleveland. I got greens and mac and cheese half chicken with damn hot spice.  I love spice but i did sweat quite a bi maybe even cried.  Someone recommended the banana pudding (best idea ever) not sure how i would have gotten through it.   It was delicious, spicy, juicy and everything you want in a chicken.  I would get the one below for spice next time , but it doesn't take away from the fantastic chicken.",,
HMU8BY7gYspKAFwPNjEiAA,,"i actually don't like raw oysters, but this place has many other great options. poboys are all pretty good, as is the jambalaya and gumbo. the atmosphere's also pretty cool, with red-checkered table-cloths and such. we had to wait a while the last time we went, but, on a weekend, that's to be expected. 
overall, a fun experience and yummy food.",
HMWAb5EuGNYL1bFQwJ2M1w,,,"Ordered twice. The first time I called in the order fried shrimp and gumbo and was told to pick it up in 40 minutes. Ended up waiting about an hour 15.  It was a bit of a mad house bc there were others waiting for their orders for a while. Second time, I had it delivered. Food was amazing as always. Given the situation with COVID, I think they handled themselves well."
HN-2o_s91nULyyIBa7x2Vg,"First stop in Nashville, Hattie B's thanks to Ugly Delicious. 

If you don't want to wait in a line, come at 9:30 on a Thursday and there will be less than a 10 minute wait. 

Ordered the large hot dark chicken entree with two sides. The mac n cheese was just mediocre and the potato salad was solid. The hot chicken spice level was hot, but you could still enjoy the flavors and have it not ruin your night in the bathroom. 

For those who have been to Boltons, Hattie B's hot spice level is probably equivalent to Bolton's mild-medium spice level. 

My friend ordered coleslaw and hot chicken sandwich; he wishes he got the large entree after seeing me and our friend order it. Regardless the hot chicken sandwich was delicious and the coleslaw was pretty standard for the area. 

Great service, nice small selection of local brews, and they have a variety of desserts on their menu that sounded delicious but too full to eat anything else besides chicken.",,
HN8iIRk7TtlPVlvQAxMDXQ,,,"Solid late night choice. Can't go wrong. Plenty of traditional options and fast service. Our waiter was soooo nice and polite. The wine selection isn't great, but I think most people in New Orleans are there for the liquor. We did have to stand in line, even at 1030 pm on a weekday, but it moved quickly. Fun atmosphere too."
HNDslDdFUEKNlu5szW7LYQ,"Very, very good food. HB's is a part of Nashville. Parking sucks so if you drive a truck park somewhere else. I have gotten the mild and medium. The mild has a nice but the medium has a great flavor. All around better taste. The thing I love most (besides the chicken) is the atmosphere. Do not come to this restaurant if you don't like people. There is a 99%  you are going to talk to the person next to you. This is Tennessee, we like to be nice. 
I also like the portion sizes. 
Take it from the guy that drives 55 miles for this place. The food is good.",,

My second course - alligator sausage and shrimp tossed with fettuccine in a creole cream sauce. YUM! My husband had a shrimp creole and wiped the bowl clean with his second roll.

They have the best oysters -- whether raw, chargrilled, or fried.  We ordered so much food yet managed to lick our plates clean.  For under $100 without tip, we had 2 dozen oysters, seafood platter of fried shrimp, fried fish, fried oysters, fried soft shell crab, and a side of hush puppies.  We also tried the medley of gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans & rice, and we shared bread pudding for dessert.  My husband washed it all down with a glass of the local beer.

Gator Bites!?  Seriously.  Who knew that these would taste so good.  If I come back for one more thing here, it would be for these.  Super tasty and they don't taste like Chicken.  Half blackened and half fried with their remoulade dipping sauce.  Mmmmmmmm.  We ordered one serving of these for 3 of us to share and I wish I had just ordered another as my entree.  Crunchy, almost tasted like meat, but not.  Yes please.

Service was great and if you can eat in the outside patio, do it.  It has that NOLA feel that you just don't get anywhere else in the country."

We have been told this is not the best out of their locations, but we have yet to be disappointed. The entire staff is super friendly!! Huge bonus. Your best bet to eat here is when they open for lunch, be prepared to wait! We have seen lines wrap around the block with over 100 people patiently waiting. Do not be alarmed if you feel ""un noticed"", as you finally approach the opening an employee will walk around with a clip board and add your name to the wait list. Keep in mind they will not sit you without your full party! Luckily for you there are bars everywhere to grab to go beers for your long wait. We personally enjoy the bar top, but when the wait is long ask for first available. The grilled oysters are amazing, but honestly have you ever had anything bad that was covered in cheese? The gumbo is awesome! Try it in their bread bowl, it's enough to fill you up so you may continue your partying in New Orleans. I have even ordered the burger and it was delicious! A must go to spot!",
HSVOH44LjNyCCsaj79Q_NA,,,"Great service, food was good and quick. I had the shrimp poboy and it was good. The teenagers ordered the crawfish fries for an appetizer and it was huge. Plenty for the whole table.  We also got there right around 3:30 pm on a Monday and were pleasantly surprised that we still received the lunch menu.  
I am originally from Louisiana so I ordered the Hurricane- haven't had one of those in years. 1. It was good 2. It was cool with the dry ice (made it smoke) 3. It was too small for the price 4. Wasn't super strong. 
Overall- great restaurant- there is a patio that we didn't know about- but would have been nice to sit outside."
-MBUTLA6WanAlX3kiI2tMA,,,"It's not bad. Neither is it great. It's ok. It's the Denny's of our visit to NOLA, and if you want a drink with flavor or finesse I suggest elsewhere. My hurricane leaned very much to the softer side. It was made festive by a bubbling piece of dry ice. I told our server that I had my first hurricane down the block at the Red Fish Grill and I thought someone had slapped me. He surprised me by saying, ""Well that's a higher end place isn't it?"" I didn't quite know how to answer him. I thought the prices were about the same. The cost of the hurricane sure was at $10. Although the Red Fish Grill did qualify their hurricane as a ""Category 5 Hurricane""

The flavor of the gumbo was very good but it really bothered us having to work past the rock-hard bits of rice that clearly came from someone scraping the rice cooker to get every last bit of rice into our bowl. The softshell crab was good. 

In the end, I guess our server was right. I should have lowered my expectations. Not bad, not good. Just ok at best."
-MEGI17yaMXKVAOy8XF4-w,"At Hattie B's it's always HOTTT! 

Coming from Chicago, it was my first time visiting Nashville so I definitely had to see what the hype was all about at Hattie B's! NEVER had a hot chicken before but this is the place to go if you're gonna try it! 

Expect a long line, but it moves pretty quickly and is worth the wait. 

My bf and I got the hot chicken sandwich, hot chicken thighs, peach cobbler w/ a scoop of vanilla ice cream (BEST COMBO), and sides: pimento mac n cheese, red skin potato salad (not pictured), and baked beans (not pictured). We had leftovers for days because of how filling the food is.

You HAVE to come here if you're in Nashville!",,
-MRzk2S6e2QGu_9PRpFv2A,"We stood in the hot Nashville summer sun today for 35 minutes for this chicken and it was worth every bite. It was the perfect amount of breading and crispness. I chose the ""Hot"" and drizzled honey on it as the employee suggested. Bingo! I'll be back. 

The line situation could probably be handled better, there was an old lady in front of me feeling ill from the heat.",,
